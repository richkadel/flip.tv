AS WITH THE PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH ANY MEDIUM OR IN ANY ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND EXERCISE CAUTION WHERE APPROPRIATE. </p>
<h4><font color="#000000"> 8. Limitation of Liability </font></h4>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL APPELIGO, ITS OWNERS/OPERATORS AND AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER FOR ANY REASON ARISING FROM OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT APPELIGO IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<h4><font color="#000000"> 9. Indemnity </font></h4>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Appeligo, its owners/operators and affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney&#8217;s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Website; (ii) your violation of any terms or conditions contained in these Terms of Service; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any Intellectual Property or other rights; or (iv) any claim that one of your User Submissions caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the Website. </p>

<h4><font color="#000000"> 10. Claims of Copyright Infringement </font></h4>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;DMCA&quot;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Appeligo infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Appeligo to locate the material on the Website; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by Appeligo against you, the DMCA permits you to send Appeligo a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Website
	should be sent to Copyright Concerns, Appeligo, Inc., 13954 Royal Dornoch Square, San Diego, CA 92128,
	<a href="mailto:copyright@appeligo.com">copyright@appeligo.com</a> or 858-433-1747. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA. Appeligo reserves the right to terminate the account of any user that is a repeat copyright infringer. </p>
<h4><font color="#000000"> 11. Access By Minors </font></h4>
<p>Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230 et seq, as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available at the web site America Links Up (http://www.netparents.org/parentstips/browsers.html). </p>
<h4><font color="#000000"> 12. Ability to Accept Terms of Service<br />
</font></h4>
<p>You affirm that you are over the age of 13 and fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. If you are not over the age of 13, then please do not use the Website. There are many websites that are for children under the age of 13, but the Website is not such a website.</p>

<h4><font color="#000000"> 13. Jurisdictional Issues</font></h4>
<p>The Website is solely directed to individuals residing in the United States. You agree that: (i) the Website shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Website shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Appeligo, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Appeligo that arises in whole or in part from the Website shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Diego County, California. </p>
<p>We make no representation that any materials or content (including User Submissions) available on or through the Website are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who choose to access the Website from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Website and/or any content (including User Submissions) to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any such service, program, film or other product that we provide.</p>
<h4><font color="#000000"> 14. Rules for Sweepstakes, Contests and Games</font></h4>
<p>Any sweepstakes, contests or games that are accessible through the Website are governed by specific rules. By entering such sweepstakes or contests or participating in such games you will become subject to those rules. We urge you to read the applicable rules, which are linked from the particular activity, and to review our Privacy Policy which, in addition to these Terms of Service, governs any information you submit in connection with such sweepstakes, contests and games.</p>
<h4><font color="#000000"> 15. Notice for California Users</font></h4>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California 95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.</p>

<h4><font color="#000000"> 16. General </font></h4>
<p>We reserve the right to immediately terminate these Terms of Service, and/or your access to and use of the Website or any portion thereof, at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Upon termination of these Terms of Service, your right to use the Website shall immediately cease, and you shall destroy all material and content obtained from the Website and all copies thereof, whether made under the terms of these Terms of Service or otherwise. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy at http://www.appeligo.com/privacy.php and any other legal notices published by Appeligo on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Appeligo concerning the Website. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Appeligo&#8217;s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
