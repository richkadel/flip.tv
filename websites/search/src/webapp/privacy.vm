We use this information to better understanding how the Flip TV Service is used, and to improve our user&rsquo;s online experience. This information is not used in a way that will personally identify you. </p>
		<p>Similarly, we may also use cookies to track and understand the traffic on our website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that our website places onto your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Cookies identify your computer hard drive so that we can recognize you the next time you visit us. We use cookies to collect and store some information about you, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time you access our website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website. We use this information to better understand our users and customize our site for your particular preferences. You may disable cookies by following directions on your web browser.

		<p>We may collect personally identifiable information from you when you seek access to certain portions of the Flip TV Service, publish or download content, or sign up for our service network. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical and email addresses, phone or fax numbers, Internet address, type of computer, and credit card information, as well as your preferences and usage patterns. This information may be used to fulfill your requests for services, to communicate with you about your account, to support your online activities, to respond to your questions, to customize your experience, and to customize the content or features of the Flip TV Service.

		<p class="memoheader2">Disclosure of Information</p>
		<blockquote><p> We may share aggregated statistical information about users of the Flip TV Service with third-parties, including our distributors, vendors, actual and potential customers, and third-parties that offer products or services for use with the Flip TV Service.

		<p>Appeligo&nbsp;will not share your personally identifiable information with any third-parties, with the following exceptions: </p></blockquote>

		</li>
		<li>If you obtain the Appeligo software bundled with product(s) from a third-party company, we may share some of your personally identifiable information (but not your credit card information) with that company. If we share your personally identifiable information with such a company, that company&rsquo;s privacy policy will govern its use of your information.
		</li>
		<li>We may be obliged or deem it necessary or appropriate to disclose your information in certain special situations. These situations include: in response to legal process such as a court order or subpoena; to prevent or combat fraud; enforcement of our Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy; or protection of the rights, property or safety of Appeligo, our users, or others.

		<p class="memoheader2">Security</p>
		<blockquote><p> Appeligo&nbsp;is committed to taking appropriate measures to protect your privacy against unauthorized disclosures. Appeligo uses a variety of secure techniques designed to protect your information. </p>
		
		<p>While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. As such, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal information from the threats of tomorrow, or that our security measures are failsafe and not subject to circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our best efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data. </p></blockquote>
		<p class="memoheader2">Third-Party Links</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Our website may contain links to other sites that you may access. These other sites have their own privacy policies and you should review those policies before following those links. We cannot control the information disclosed at these third-party sites or how that information is used.</p>
