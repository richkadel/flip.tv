<a name="1169901018407"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>This week on Safari Hunter's Journal, we travel to Namibia to hunt the signature game of the African desert, the gemsbok and the springbok.
<p/>
<a name="1169901020943"/>We are hunting with John Wambach of Pro Guiding.
<p/>
<a name="1169901027449"/>We will be doing our hunt a bit differently this week, as we mount up for a horseback Safari, African style.
<p/>
<a name="1169901028383"/>So saddle up.
<p/>
<a name="1169901073562"/>There's all this and more coming your way right now on Safari Hunter's Journal.
<p/>
<a name="1169901085240"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Safari Hunter's Journal withour host, Steve Scott.
<p/>
<a name="1169901093749"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>In the many years we've hunted Africa, we've had a variety of wonderful hunting opportunities, but nothing approaches this Namibia hunt.
<p/>
<a name="1169901101590"/>Getting within shooting distance of any African game animal is generally a challenge, particularly because of the animal's fear of humans.
<p/>
<a name="1169901122678"/>But what would happen if we could approach our quarry on four legs?
<p/>
<a name="1169901124923"/>Tom, this is just beautiful.
<p/>
<a name="1169901128050"/>The facilities are first rate.
<p/>
<a name="1169901134189"/>The horses, I mean I'm not much of a judge of horse flesh, but these look like really great animals.
<p/>
<a name="1169901141697"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, these horses are imported from Europe, and they are qualified for long-distance riding.
<p/>
<a name="1169901149038"/>And they will be qualified also for prospect safari, or hunting from a horseback.
<p/>
<a name="1169901159048"/>And maybe you can imagine what kind of opportunities gives you when you are sitting on a horse and you are surrounded from animals.
<p/>
<a name="1169901162051"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Now you brought these in for endurance racing?
<p/>
<a name="1169901175597"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Actually these horses are already approved and bought for endurance riding races, but we are using them also for a normal horseback safari.
<p/>
<a name="1169901176331"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Uh-huh.
<p/>
<a name="1169901181036"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>They will take you as far you want to go on our property.
<p/>
<a name="1169901181904"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>I'm sure they will.
<p/>
<a name="1169901186709"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>So you will not be afraid that you will not-- or you have to walk back.
<p/>
<a name="1169901201790"/>And yes, we will use them premier for endurance, but we have also trained horses now for doing hunts or safari from the horseback.
<p/>
<a name="1169901204793"/>So you will not race with the horses.
<p/>
<a name="1169901208997"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Well, that's, uh, that's good for me, because I'm not much of a horse guy.
<p/>
<a name="1169901209765"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Okay.
<p/>
<a name="1169901213836"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>But safaris as well as game viewing, because I assume that you can get close.
<p/>
<a name="1169901221977"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>You will get very close, and you will really enjoy your safari from the horseback.
<p/>
<a name="1169901224646"/>You can almost touch them.
<p/>
<a name="1169901226715"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Well, I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
<p/>
<a name="1169901229618"/>But before we get started, mind showing me the rest of the ranch?
<p/>
<a name="1169901230419"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yes, you're welcome.
<p/>
<a name="1169901275564"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>That's great, thank you.
<p/>
<a name="1169901287376"/>Well it's beautiful, Tom.
<p/>
<a name="1169901288410"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Thanks.
<p/>
<a name="1169901291046"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>I can't believe this is Namibia.
<p/>
<a name="1169901293416"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, we still have water.
<p/>
<a name="1169901295150"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>And you named this after your daughter?
<p/>
<a name="1169901296652"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yes, Kimberly.
<p/>
<a name="1169901298287"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>That's cool.
<p/>
<a name="1169901300889"/>Hey, what's that noise?
<p/>
<a name="1169901303192"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Sounds like it's a cow?
<p/>
<a name="1169901303959"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Jackal?
<p/>
<a name="1169901304393"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Jackal?
<p/>
<a name="1169901309398"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Maybe.
<p/>
<a name="1169901310332"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Tom, ya see.
<p/>
<a name="1169901311633"/>See right there through the bush?
<p/>
<a name="1169901312768"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>I see something moving.
<p/>
<a name="1169901314369"/>It looks, I think that is a jackal.
<p/>
<a name="1169901325514"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yes, yes.
<p/>
<a name="1169901326815"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Right.
<p/>
<a name="1169901357346"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Here, hold the sticks.
<p/>
<a name="1169901359148"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Hah, I think I got him.
<p/>
<a name="1169901360883"/>It's hard to tell.
<p/>
<a name="1169901363852"/>Let's go see.
<p/>
<a name="1169901366889"/>This is our little friend, the jackal.
<p/>
<a name="1169901378334"/>He is uh, the coyote of Africa, and the bane of every small antelope fawn in the veld.
<p/>
<a name="1169901382471"/>Wow, that was, that was a tough little shot.
<p/>
<a name="1169901384239"/>That was a tough shot.
<p/>
<a name="1169901399755"/>But they're extremely aggressive and persistent and can really wreak havoc on the fawn crop each year, so I know that Tom is gonna be glad that we've eliminated another predator from the veld.
<p/>
<a name="1169901402658"/>And it was a fun shot, too.
<p/>
<a name="1169901406462"/>An opportunity for a shot on a jackal is a welcome surprise.
<p/>
<a name="1169901410609"/>But a chance to hunt on horseback doesn't come around too often.
<p/>

<div class="PAINTON">
<a name="1169901539562"/>Though I'm not much of a rider, it's an opportunity that I'm definitely looking forward to.

<p/>
<a name="1169901627917"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Well, the horseback is unique, ya know.
<p/>
<a name="1169901630353"/>It's not just a mode of transport.
<p/>
<a name="1169901635157"/>It's that the whole scene of, ya know, it's quiet.
<p/>
<a name="1169901641697"/>You're actually experiencing nature, you're hearing the birds, the creak of saddle leather.
<p/>
<a name="1169901649138"/>It's amazing, and then the animals really don't know you're there until you're basically right on top of them.
<p/>
<a name="1169901652641"/>You become a part of what's going on in the bush.
<p/>
<a name="1169901655611"/>And that's what makes it really a full experience.
<p/>
<a name="1169901667456"/>And then of course the horses give you that, I'd sa an advantage where if the game spots you, they sort of, well, it's just another animal.
<p/>
<a name="1169901671760"/>They tend not to see what's on top of the horses, and they're not bothered by it.
<p/>
<a name="1169901682204"/>And you can get into a bit of cover if the wind's good and then sneak up and get a nice good closeup shot.
<p/>
<a name="1169901682906"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>John, I dunno.
<p/>
<a name="1169901687743"/>I got off the plane in Africa, and it turned out to be Wyoming.
<p/>
<a name="1169901689612"/>What's going on here?
<p/>
<a name="1169901692748"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, it's something special we have here.
<p/>
<a name="1169901695919"/>These horses and to be able to do safari on 'em.
<p/>
<a name="1169901701257"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>So, we're actually gonna stock up on animals on these big old things.
<p/>
<a name="1169901701690"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yep.
<p/>
<a name="1169901702325"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>It's gonna work.
<p/>
<a name="1169901702958"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>It's gonna work.
<p/>
<a name="1169901705294"/>We're gonna get the wind the right way...
<p/>
<a name="1169901705928"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yah.
<p/>
<a name="1169901708431"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>...r us, no human sounds.
<p/>
<a name="1169901710266"/>The game's not even gonna know we're there.
<p/>
<a name="1169901714438"/>These horses are gonna give us that advantage just to get so much closer to the game.
<p/>
<a name="1169901719119"/>When John approached me about the idea of doin' a horseback safari, I was a little ambivalent.
<p/>
<a name="1169901722945"/>I thought it was a neat idea, but I am not a horse guy.
<p/>
<a name="1169901725114"/>I do this in Wyoming every year.
<p/>
<a name="1169901726282"/>It's not my favorite thing.
<p/>
<a name="1169901728784"/>And horses and I, frankly, just don't get along.
<p/>
<a name="1169901735224"/>But I was looking forward to the opportunity of possibly getting closer to these African animals than we've really gotten before.
<p/>
<a name="1169901737660"/>You get close when you're at the waterhole on a high.
<p/>
<a name="1169901741864"/>But when you're out just walkin' around, they see that man form, and they're gone.
<p/>
<a name="1169901750406"/>And John assured me that if we stayed with the horses and didn't let them see that human silhouette that we could get close.
<p/>
<a name="1169901751440"/>SafariTexas style.
<p/>
<a name="1169901752942"/>I guess we'll give it a go.
<p/>
<a name="1169901753376"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>All right.
<p/>
<a name="1169901755144"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>All right, after you, Bowanna.
<p/>
<a name="1169901794283"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Let's go.
<p/>
<a name="1169901795685"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, it was pretty neat.
<p/>
<a name="1169901801791"/>We spotted the springbok out there in the savanna under the camel thorn trees.
<p/>
<a name="1169901810499"/>They were watching us, and we'd worked off to their right, but to get into some cover and get close enough.
<p/>
<a name="1169901818751"/>And they just stood there looking at us, and we sort of worked the horses, worked the horses until we got, until about a hundred yards away from them.
<p/>
<a name="1169901822478"/>And that for springbok is very close.
<p/>
<a name="1169901831520"/>We've got good cover from here.
<p/>
<a name="1169901844277"/>Okay, right there.
<p/>
<a name="1169901875498"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>We got to about 250 meters, got behind some brush, dismounted, and then just made a little sneak to a group of small trees.
<p/>
<a name="1169901876599"/>That is a nice ram.
<p/>
<a name="1169901878734"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Oh ah, that's him.
<p/>
<a name="1169901880103"/>That's him standing on the right-hand side.
<p/>
<a name="1169901896786"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>All right.
<p/>
<a name="1169901898621"/>Okay, there he took off to the right now.
<p/>
<a name="1169901899122"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah.
<p/>
<a name="1169901901190"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>It's okay, they're playing.
<p/>
<a name="1169901901991"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>They haven't spotted us?
<p/>
<a name="1169901903026"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, they haven't spotted us.
<p/>
<a name="1169901904560"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Look, all those ewes are still there.
<p/>
<a name="1169901907864"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, he'll come back.
<p/>
<a name="1169901910566"/>He's behind the brush there on the right there.
<p/>
<a name="1169901912735"/>Yeah, the horses have got them totally...
<p/>
<a name="1169901913669"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>...mesmerized.
<p/>
<a name="1169901914170"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Fooled.
<p/>
<a name="1169901916105"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah.
<p/>
<a name="1169901918808"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>They don't know we're here.
<p/>
<a name="1169901920576"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Here comes a ewe back from the left.
<p/>
<a name="1169901921344"/>There he is.
<p/>
<a name="1169901923780"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, there he is, behind the stump tree.
<p/>
<a name="1169901924981"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>All right.
<p/>
<a name="1169901925358"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Okay?
<p/>
<a name="1169901926916"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Just to the right of the tree, correct?
<p/>
<a name="1169901927683"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>That's him.
<p/>
<a name="1169901929785"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yah, he's got those big, massive horns.
<p/>
<a name="1169901930654"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yep.
<p/>
<a name="1169901932722"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>You ready?
<p/>
<a name="1169901933523"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>You can take him.
<p/>
<a name="1169901953876"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Okay.
<p/>
<a name="1169901954677"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Down?
<p/>
<a name="1169901955278"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>He's down.
<p/>
<a name="1169901957390"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Excellent.
<p/>
<a name="1169901960016"/>Excellent, horseback safari.
<p/>
<a name="1169901973096"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>All right.
<p/>
<a name="1169901975298"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Rare to see this on video.
<p/>
<a name="1169901977734"/>Tell us quickly while it's--
<p/>
<a name="1169901980436"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>It's closing up now, but this is the pronk.
<p/>
<a name="1169901986409"/>And it's our way--we think and like to believe-- that he's saying goodbye with all that beauty.
<p/>
<a name="1169901987276"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah.
<p/>
<a name="1169901990380"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>And unfortunately, we're just getting the last part of it here.
<p/>
<a name="1169901995785"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, but there's that beautiful aroma of honey or fresh-baked bread.
<p/>
<a name="1169902000690"/>It's justuch a beautiful, just such a beautiful, unique animal.
<p/>
<a name="1169902003292"/>And, and a very nice trophy.
<p/>
<a name="1169902005361"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Perfect, wonderful old ram.
<p/>
<a name="1169902005895"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yes.
<p/>
<a name="1169902006939"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Points going back.
<p/>
<a name="1169902009298"/>Heavy bases.
<p/>
<a name="1169902010867"/>And being on horseback--
<p/>
<a name="1169902010867"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Oh!
<p/>
<a name="1169902012802"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>--and getting this close to them is just incredible.
<p/>
<a name="1169902017974"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>What was unbelievable to me is we could t that close and got off in some cover.
<p/>
<a name="1169902019042"/>They were still curious.
<p/>
<a name="1169902020877"/>We take the shot.
<p/>
<a name="1169902021744"/>We step out.
<p/>
<a name="1169902024013"/>Whew, they're gone, gone.
<p/>
<a name="1169902026215"/>Getting up on the horses is just fantastic.
<p/>
<a name="1169902026549"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yep.
<p/>
<a name="1169902028584"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>That's a really unique way to safari.
<p/>
<a name="1169902030520"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>It sure is, well done, perfect shot.

<p/>
<a name="1169902222813"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>When is a good rhino a dead rhino?
<p/>
<a name="1169902228251"/>When the fallen beast symbolizes the emergence of the species from near extinction.
<p/>
<a name="1169902235559"/>In fact, today the rhinoceros exists in such large numbers as to easily sustain a hunting quota.
<p/>
<a name="1169902239329"/>But this conservation success story didn't happen overnight.
<p/>
<a name="1169902254277"/>The creation of protected areas and breeding rhinos on private ranches by insightful politicians, dedicated conservationists, and a cash infusion from hunters was instrumental in bringing the white rhinoceros back from the brink.
<p/>
<a name="1169902264621"/>In the late 1800s, the southern white rhino was thought to be extinct, shot into oblivion by poachers selling rhino horn to markets in Asia and the Middle East.
<p/>
<a name="1169902271461"/>But a small population was rediscovered in Natal, South Africa, and the species' rescue began.
<p/>
<a name="1169902275932"/>Rhinoceros security guards were posted to protect the animals from poaching.
<p/>
<a name="1169902281938"/>Breeding pairs were established on private ranches, and slowly the numbers began to increase.
<p/>
<a name="1169902291181"/>But an important factor in causing the rhino population to really take off was the economic incentive to the landowner provided by sport hunting.
<p/>
<a name="1169902303794"/>An expensive animal to kill, many South African landowners found they could generate significant annual revenue through semiannual dart or green hunts by western clients looking to finish their big five.
<p/>
<a name="1169902307597"/>The economic incentive of ownership caused demand to rise.
<p/>
<a name="1169902310167"/>Breeding programs became pritable.
<p/>
<a name="1169902313637"/>And species numbers began to increase dramatically.
<p/>
<a name="1169902318642"/>Today, white rhino numbers exceed 11,000 worldwide.
<p/>
<a name="1169902327418"/>And according to the conservation group World Wildlife Fund, the white rhinoceros is one of the world's greatest conservation success stories.
<p/>
<a name="1169902331888"/>And this conservation success story was funded by hunters.
<p/>
<a name="1169902348238"/>Until next time, know the facts and keep preserving the heritage.
<p/>
<a name="1169902352943"/>The gemsbok or the oryx on this place are great specimens.
<p/>
<a name="1169902355979"/>I mean they have some really big bulls here.
<p/>
<a name="1169902370594"/>We weren't as interested in the trophy as we were in just the accomplishment, because these animals have tremendous sight, and they're very, very wary.
<p/>
<a name="1169902379836"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>We rode up on a group, and they just stood there.
<p/>
<a name="1169902382049"/>And Steve--we all dismounted.
<p/>
<a name="1169902387644"/>Steve got off and took about three steps forward, kneeled down, had a good rest.
<p/>
<a name="1169902405028"/>And there was a bull facing us.
<p/>
<a name="1169902407331"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>On the right?
<p/>
<a name="1169902428585"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Okay.
<p/>
<a name="1169902431088"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Oh man--oh no.
<p/>
<a name="1169902432456"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>...did I hit him?
<p/>
<a name="1169902434858"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>You dropped him, and you nearly killed yourself.
<p/>
<a name="1169902436427"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>I drew blood.
<p/>
<a name="1169902437961"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Two sides, well done.
<p/>
<a name="1169902438662"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Oh thanks.
<p/>
<a name="1169902439363"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Oh man.
<p/>
<a name="1169902441132"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Oh well, it's happened before.
<p/>
<a name="1169902441765"/>It'll happen again.
<p/>
<a name="1169902444235"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>
<p/>
<a name="1169902446503"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>I wish I'd remember, my friend.
<p/>
<a name="1169902448205"/>So, he went down?
<p/>
<a name="1169902449072"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>He went down, yeah.
<p/>
<a name="1169902450041"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Okay, all right.
<p/>
<a name="1169902450674"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Great shot.
<p/>
<a name="1169902452976"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Do we need to walk the horses over, I guess?
<p/>
<a name="1169902453945"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Face-on, again.
<p/>
<a name="1169902454845"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>All right.
<p/>
<a name="1169902458182"/>That seems to be all we get are face-on shots.
<p/>
<a name="1169902459750"/>No pun intended on this one.
<p/>
<a name="1169902463720"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>They just stood there, and that's incredible.
<p/>
<a name="1169902468525"/>Especially you have these oryx here-- they don't usually give you much opportunity.
<p/>
<a name="1169902473897"/>And they just stood there, looking at the horses and never realized that they were huns with them.
<p/>
<a name="1169902478902"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Ya know, 125-yard shot at a standing oryx, ya can't ask for much more than that.
<p/>
<a name="1169902486844"/>John, the finish for a great safari, a horseback safari.
<p/>
<a name="1169902488212"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, it was incredible.
<p/>
<a name="1169902497121"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, I'm just amazed at how close we can get, because we've been looking on our other hunts at oryx, the whole time.
<p/>
<a name="1169902498989"/>Look and run, look and run.
<p/>
<a name="1169902506997"/>And this whole little herd just kinda stood and said, "Hey, what are those tall horses?"
<p/>
<a name="1169902508699"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Ha-ha, yeah, that was incredible.
<p/>
<a name="1169902514538"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>But this is an oryx or a gemsbok, and it's a good male.
<p/>
<a name="1169902517908"/>Not the best trophy we'll take, but a good representative male.
<p/>
<a name="1169902519777"/>And tell me about the oryx.
<p/>
<a name="1169902526016"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Well really, desert animals but well adapted for the savanna and bush here.
<p/>
<a name="1169902528118"/>And very hardy animals and really hard to hunt.
<p/>
<a name="1169902533457"/>And, well we just found an advantage by doing it on the horseback.
<p/>
<a name="1169902540964"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>I'll tell ya, if you like horses at all, at all, this is a great way to safari, because you really get close to the animals.
<p/>
<a name="1169902545436"/>And ya know, I had to cheat out a little bit to take the shot, of course.
<p/>
<a name="1169902547271"/>Didn't seem to bother them at all.
<p/>
<a name="1169902548339"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Sure didn't.
<p/>
<a name="1169902551976"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>And I got my little kiss from Miss Swarovski here.
<p/>
<a name="1169902555980"/>always like an Austrian, but she said-- you said "a member of the club," ya know.
<p/>
<a name="1169902559083"/>I've been initiated many, many times.
<p/>
<a name="1169902560652"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>Yeah, but it all worked out well.
<p/>
<a name="1169902561452"/><span class="speaker">&gt;&gt; </span>What a great safari.
