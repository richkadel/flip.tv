<p/>
<a name="1172226608903"/>HI, EVERYBODY, I'M RACHAEL RAY, AND TODAY I'M IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226613208"/>HOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS TEA PARTY, THIS CITY IS STEEPED IN COLORFUL HISTORY.
<p/>
<a name="1172226620715"/>BOSTON IS ALSO A CENTER OF ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY, WHERE THE BLUE BLOODS MEET THE BLUE COLLARS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226623785"/>WHICH SIDE OF THE CHARLES RIVER AM I GONNA END UP AT?
<p/>
<a name="1172226626257"/>I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT BECAUSE I'VE GOT 24 HOURS AND $40.
<p/>
<a name="1172226632961"/>MONEY MONEY MONEY. CAN I AFFORD MORE THAN BOSTON BAKED BEANS WITH MY BUDGET?
<p/>
<a name="1172226635397"/>STICK AROUND AND FIND OUT.
<p/>
<a name="1172226657686"/>MONEY MONEY MONEY.  TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OLD, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, IS SO FULL OF HISTORY, IT'S HARD TO GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT SEEING A PIECE OF AMERICA'S PAST.
<p/>
<a name="1172226670532"/>FROM THE BOSTON TEA PARTY TO PAUL REVERE, THIS NEW ENGLAND CITY IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.
<p/>
<a name="1172226679975"/>COBBLESTONE STREETS AND 17th-CENTURY ARCHITECTURE ARE PART OF THE CHARM OF BOSTON'S MANY QUAINT NEIGHBORHOODS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226684079"/>BOSTON COMMON IS THIS COUNTRY'S OLDEST PARK.
<p/>
<a name="1172226687048"/>AND HARVARD...
<p/>
<a name="1172226692320"/>WELL, THIS FAMOUS UNIVERSITY WAS FOUNDED IN 1636, BEFORE AMERICA WAS EVEN ITS OWN NATION.
<p/>
<a name="1172226702197"/>HOME TO SEVERAL MAJOR UNIVERSITIES, BOSTON IS A BOOMING COLLEGE TOWN, RICH WITH HISTORY, CULTURE, AND A FANTASTIC CHOICE OF RESTAURANTS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226715176"/>SEAFOOD IS AN OBVIOUS STAPLE HERE, BUT THE DIVERSITY OF BOSTON PRESENTS ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD.
<p/>
<a name="1172226722517"/>IT'S SUCH A POPULAR CITY WITH SO MUCH TO OFFER THAT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST EXPENSIVE PLACES TO LIVE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226728857"/>BUT THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS AND GREAT CHOICES THAT I BET I CAN FIND SOME REALLY GOOD, AFFORDABLE FOOD.
<p/>
<a name="1172226732794"/>I JUST NEED TO LOOK AROUND A LITTLE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226737766"/>LOOK AT THIS WEATHER, HUH?
<p/>
<a name="1172226743104"/>I'M ON MY WAY TO JOIN A WALKING TOUR, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT ONLY SPENDING 24 HOURS IN A CITY.
<p/>
<a name="1172226744840"/>YOU CAN'T LET THE RAIN DAMPEN YOUR SPIRITS WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING.
<p/>
<a name="1172226749077"/>PLUS, IN NEW ENGLAND, THE WEATHER CAN CHANGE AT THE DROP OF A HAT.
<p/>
<a name="1172226751546"/>AND I HAD A LITTLE EXTRA INCENTIVE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226757719"/>I GOT THIS CARD FROM THE GREATER BOSTON CONVENTIONS AND VISITORS BUREAU, AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FREE...
<p/>
<a name="1172226758153"/>HOW'S THAT FOR A DEAL!
<p/>
<a name="1172226764926"/>I CAN PRESENT THIS ALL OVER TOWN AT DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS AND ATTRACTIONS AND TOURS AND GET 15 TO 50 PERCENT OFF.
<p/>
<a name="1172226771299"/>THE FREEDOM TOUR TRAIL I'M ABOUT TO TAKE, I GOT 15 PERCENT OFF THE NORMAL PRICE JUST BECAUSE I CALLED AHEAD, DID A LITTLE RESEARCH.
<p/>
<a name="1172226775804"/>WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO THE BOSTON FREEDOM TRAIL.
<p/>
<a name="1172226780876"/>THAT'S THAT RED LINE ON THE GROUND, BUT BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER, I THOUGHT I MIGHT TAKE A MOMENT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOU FOLKS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226783445"/>MY NAME IS SAMUEL ADAMS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226785714"/>AND IT'S STILL A GOOD DAY TO SEE THE FREEDOM TRAIL.
<p/>
<a name="1172226787549"/>THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS TO SEE...
<p/>
<a name="1172226789251"/>THE BOSTON TEA PARTY STARTED AT THE OLD SOUTH MEETING HOUSE...
<p/>
<a name="1172226789584"/>WE CAN GO SEE THAT.
<p/>
<a name="1172226791787"/>THE MASSACRE HAPPENED AT THE OLD STATE HOUSE...
<p/>
<a name="1172226792153"/>WE'LL GO SEE THAT.
<p/>
<a name="1172226794790"/>LET'S START WALKING ALONG THE TRAIL RIGHT NOW.
<p/>
<a name="1172226805500"/>OUR FIRST STOP IS THE OLD STATE HOUSE, SITE OF THE BOSTON MASSACRE IN 1770, WHERE FIVE MEN WERE KILLED IN A CLASH BETWEEN PATRIOTS AND REDCOATS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226809738"/>THIS BALCONY IS WHERE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WAS FIRST READ HERE IN BOSTON.
<p/>
<a name="1172226817579"/>THE FREEDOM TRAIL COVERS THREE MILES OF BOSTON STREETS AND SIDEWALKS THROUGH DOWNTOWN, ACROSS THE BOSTON COMMON AND PAST THE PAUL REVERE HOUSE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226822384"/>HERE WE ARE AT FANEUIL HALL.
<p/>
<a name="1172226824319"/>WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE FIRST SHOPPING MALL IN AMERICA.
<p/>
<a name="1172226826688"/>THEY HAD A DIFFERENT NAME FOR IT BACK THEN...
<p/>
<a name="1172226827122"/>A COMMON MARKETPLACE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226829225"/>BUT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS...
<p/>
<a name="1172226829825"/>FIRST SHOPPING MALL IN AMERICA.
<p/>
<a name="1172226837632"/>THE COMMON MARKETPLACE IDEA WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO EXPAND IT IN THE EARLY 1800s WITH QUINCY MARKET HERE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226841937"/>AND NOW IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE FULL OF TAVERNS AND SHOPS AND WONDERFUL RESTAURANTS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226843538"/>ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE COME HERE EVERY DAY TO SEE QUINCY MARKET.
<p/>
<a name="1172226848410"/>NOW LET'S WALK ALONG THE FREEDOM TRAIL AND SEE SOME MORE HISTORY OUT THERE IN BOSTON.
<p/>
<a name="1172226850278"/>LET'S GO.
<p/>
<a name="1172226856451"/>YOU KNOW, WALKING TOURS ARE A GREAT WAY TO SEE A LOT OF SIGHTS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
<p/>
<a name="1172226862791"/>PLUS THEY CAN HELP YOU DECIDE ON WHAT INTERESTS YOU WITHOUT REALLY FEELING LIKE YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON ANYTHING AT ALL.
<p/>
<a name="1172226863492"/>ME...
<p/>
<a name="1172226872234"/>I'M GETTING HUNGRY, AND WHEN WE PASSED FANEUIL HALL AND I SMELLED ALL OF THOSE GREAT SMELLS COMING OUT OF THAT QUINCY MARKET BUILDING, I JUST KNEW IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO FIND SOME BREAKFAST.
<p/>
<a name="1172226879107"/>WOW!
<p/>
<a name="1172226880509"/>OH, GORGEOUS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226890719"/>"THIS BUILDING HAS SERVED THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON "AS THE CENTRAL MARKET OF THE CITY SINCE ITS DEDICATION "IN AUGUST, 1826."
<p/>
<a name="1172226898326"/>WOW, THERE'S SO MUCH FOOD IN HERE, THE HARD PART'S TRYING TO MAKE A CHOICE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226904733"/>OH, HOT DOGS!
<p/>
<a name="1172226906368"/>ALL RIGHT, IT'S A LITTLE BIT EARLY FOR THAT, THOUGH.
<p/>
<a name="1172226910806"/>CHINESE, GREEK...
<p/>
<a name="1172226915210"/>YOU KNOW, YOU COULD SPEND ALL DAY IN HERE AND JUST EAT FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER.
<p/>
<a name="1172226918780"/>OH, FRUIT.
<p/>
<a name="1172226923351"/>A FRUIT SMOOTHIE SOUNDS REALLY REFRESHING, AND IT WOULDN'T HURT TO HAVE SOMETHING HEALTHY.
<p/>
<a name="1172226926321"/>THE MONKEY BAR USES FRESH FRUITS, YOGURT, OR ICE CREAM.
<p/>
<a name="1172226932461"/>I'M HAVING A STRAWBERRY SUNRISE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226935163"/>THANK YOU.
<p/>
<a name="1172226935464"/>THANK YOU.
<p/>
<a name="1172226936865"/>MMM, IT'S FABULOUS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226939000"/>THIS IS REALLY GOOD...
<p/>
<a name="1172226941269"/>I'VE GOT ALL MY FRUIT, BUT I NEED A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE.
<p/>
<a name="1172226944239"/>OH, IT SMELLS EQUALLY GOOD ON THIS END.
<p/>
<a name="1172226951413"/>OH, I LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS, A BAKESHOP, CAROL ANN BAKE SHOP.
<p/>
<a name="1172226954182"/>THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA PASS THIS UP.
<p/>
<a name="1172226957018"/>A CRANBERRY MUFFIN SOUNDS GREAT, AND IT'S ONLY $1.25.
<p/>
<a name="1172226960822"/>SO I HAVE ENOUGH LEFT OVER FOR A LARGE COFFEE TOO.
<p/>
<a name="1172226965127"/>CAROL ANN BAKE SHOP HAS BEEN IN FANEUIL HALL FOR 25 YEARS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226969064"/>THEY MAKE ALL OF THEIR PASTRY FRESH EVERY DAY.
<p/>
<a name="1172226974970"/>THE MUFFIN I'M ABOUT TO EAT WAS BAKED EARLY THIS MORNING BY MARCEL.
<p/>
<a name="1172226979908"/>THEY COME STRAIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN, TO THE COUNTER, AND THEN OUT TO THE LUCKY CUSTOMERS.
<p/>
<a name="1172226983445"/>CRANBERRY MUFFIN...
<p/>
<a name="1172226986448"/>YOU NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM FINDING ANYTHING CRANBERRY IN NEW ENGLAND.
<p/>
<a name="1172226989651"/>IT'S GOT NUTS IN IT TOO.
<p/>
<a name="1172226991953"/>CRANBERRIES ARE NICE AND TART...
<p/>
<a name="1172226992454"/>THAT'S WHY I LOVE THEM SO.
<p/>
<a name="1172226996592"/>YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY A LOT OF FUN.
<p/>
<a name="1172227006468"/>I MEAN, YOU COME TO A BIG MARKETPLACE LIKE THIS, CHANCES ARE NINE OUT OF TEN TIMES, YOU'RE GONNA FIND SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY SUITS YOUR BUDGET, BUT ALSO SUITS YOUR TASTE.
<p/>
<a name="1172227011607"/>I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED FOR BREAKFAST, AND IT DIDN'T COST ME MORE THAN I CAN SPEND.
<p/>
<a name="1172227017779"/>MY MUFFIN, COFFEE, AND FRUIT SMOOTHIE ALTOGETHER ONLY COST ME $6.15.
<p/>
<a name="1172227023352"/>ADD IN TAX AND A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THE TIP JAR, AND MY TOTAL'S JUST $6.95.
<p/>
<a name="1172227025721"/>THAT LEAVES ME WITH MORE THAN $33 FOR THE REST OF MY DAY.
<p/>
<a name="1172227029625"/>UP NEXT, I SEARCH FOR SOME GREAT LOCAL SEAFOOD.
<p/>
<a name="1172227032694"/>OH, THEY GOT CLAM ROLLS!
<p/>
<a name="1172227036698"/>WILL I HAVE TO SWIM FOR SOMETHING FRESH OR CAN I CATCH A GREAT DEAL?

<p/>
<a name="1172227208437"/>THERE'S TONS OF PLACES TO SHOP, AND THERE'S AN ECLECTIC MIX OF INTERNATIONAL RESTAURANTS.
<p/>
<a name="1172227215043"/>BOSTON IS, IN FACT, NEW ENGLAND'S LARGEST CITY, AND IT'S DEFINITELY A GREAT PLACE FOR SOME REALLY GOOD FOOD.
<p/>
<a name="1172227223485"/>LUCKY FOR ME IT STOPPED RAINING, SO I THINK I'LL CHECK OUT A PART OF BOSTON CALLED BACK BAY.
<p/>
<a name="1172227228690"/>NEWBURY STREET IS ESPECIALLY WELL KNOWN FOR ITS EXCLUSIVE STORES AND UPSCALE RESTAURANTS.
<p/>
<a name="1172227234530"/>I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO EAT HERE, BUT IT WON'T HURT TO LOOK AROUND.
<p/>
<a name="1172227236498"/>DIPTYQUE...
<p/>
<a name="1172227236932"/>I WONDER WHAT THAT IS?
<p/>
<a name="1172227245341"/>I LEARNED THAT DIPTYQUE IS A RENOWNED FRENCH PERFUMERY ON SAINT GERMAIN BOULEVARD IN PARIS FOR OVER 40 YEARS.
<p/>
<a name="1172227251413"/>THEY RECENTLY OPENED THEIR FIRST BOUTIQUE IN THE U.S. RIGHT HERE IN BOSTON.
<p/>
<a name="1172227256485"/>THEY MAKE OVER 50 VARIETIES OF HAND-CRAFTED CANDLES, AS WELL AS SCENTED SOAPS, PERFUMES, AND ROOM SPRAYS.
<p/>
<a name="1172227263459"/>THAT ONE'S KIND OF PINEY...
<p/>
<a name="1172227263692"/>I LIKE IT.
<p/>
<a name="1172227264293"/>IT'S ROOM SPRAY.
<p/>
<a name="1172227267963"/>OH, I JUST PUT ROOM SPRAY ON!
<p/>
<a name="1172227272534"/>I THINK I BETTER ASK FOR HELP.
<p/>
<a name="1172227285180"/>BRIANNA EXPLAINS TO ME THAT ALL THE FRAGRANCES AT THEIR STORE ARE UNISEX, AND AS I FOUND OUT, SOME OF THEIR SPRAYS CAN EVEN BE USED AROUND THE HOUSE, LIKE THIS VINEGAR SOLUTION THAT CAN BE USED IN THE BATHROOM OR IN THE KITCHEN.
<p/>
<a name="1172227286548"/>I LIKE THE FIG...
<p/>
<a name="1172227290286"/>I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE A SMALL FIG, PLEASE, THE SMALL FIG, I'LL GRAB ONE FOR YOU.
<p/>
<a name="1172227292221"/>AND MY LITTLE RESTAURANT BLACK BOOK.
<p/>
<a name="1172227296959"/>IT'S TIME FOR LUNCH, AND I'M GETTING HUNGRY.

<a name="1172227300763"/>I REALLY WANT SOME SEAFOOD, BUT EVERYTHING IN BACK BAY IS SO EXPENSIVE.
<p/>
<a name="1172227305501"/>I THINK I'LL CHECK OUT ONE MORE SHOP AND SEE IF I CAN GET SOME TIPS.
<p/>
<a name="1172227311440"/>BLISS HAS A BEAUTIFUL VARIETY OF GIFTS AND SUPPOSEDLY WON THE BEST BRIDAL REGISTRY FOR BOSTON THREE YEARS IN A ROW.

<p/>
<a name="1172227327923"/>I'M KINDA IN THE MOOD 'CAUSE I'M IN BOSTON.
<p/>
<a name="1172227330192"/>DO THEY ALSO HAVE CLAMS...
<p/>
<a name="1172227333962"/>I BELIEVE THEY DO HAVE SEAFOOD AND STEAMED CLAMS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT.
<p/>
<a name="1172227335731"/>AND IT'S AFFORDABLE...

<p/>
<a name="1172227388217"/>ROAST BEEF IS THEIR SPECIALTY, BUT THEY ALSO SERVE HOT DOGS, HAMBURGERS, FRIED SCALLOPS, CLAMS, AND FISH.
