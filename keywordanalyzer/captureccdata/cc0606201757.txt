TO WORK 
WITH AND GET 
GOING.
AND MERV SAID IN
THE REGAME SHOW,
NOT ONLY KNOWING
THE GUYS' 
SWINGS, HE CAN 
GET THAT DOWN IN
ONE DAY.
IT'S GOOD TO 
KNOW WHAT'S 
GOING ON BETWEEN
THE EARS.
MERV SAID ON THE
PLANE AFTER 
WATCHING 
GREENIE, HE SAID
"HE'S A GOOD 
ONE."
HE HAS SUCH HIGH
POTENTIAL.
WE AUNL THAT. 
MATT: IT'S BEEN 
A SOLID MONTH 
SINCE GREENE'S 
LAST HOME RUN, 
MAY 20TH AGAINST
SEATTLE.
AND YOU TALK TO 
SOME AND IT'S A 
MECHANICS ISSUE 
WITH KHALIL 
BEING A FEEL 
HITTER AND THE 
FACT THAT HE'S 
CONSTANTLY 
FEELING 
DIFFERENT AND 
CHANGING HIS 
STANCE AND 
APPROACH, 
SEEMINGLY AT-BAT
TO AT-BAT, THERE
ARE THOSE THAT 
FEEL LIKE IT'S 
GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT TO GET
INTO RHYTHM WHEN
YOU'RE DEALING 
WITH YOURSELF 
LIKE THAT, BUT 
THEN YOU CAN 
LOOK AT A GUY 
LIKE CAL RIPKEN 
AND SAY, THAT'S 
NOT TRUE, 
BECAUSE HE DID 
THAT ALL THE 
TIME, AND LOOK 
AT WHAT HE DID.
MARK: IT'S 
ALMOST LIKE A 
PITCHER CHANGING
HIS DELIVERY 
EACH AND EVERY 
PITCH.
GUYS TRYING TO 
BE CONSISTENT.
SOMETIMES THEY 
WILL ALTER THE 
RELEASE POINT 
AND THE ARM 
ANGLE ON CERTAIN
PITCHES, BUT 
MECHANICALLY 
SPEAKING, YOUR 
BODY IS PRETTY 
MUCH THE SAME.
MATT: BLEW A 
FASTBALL PAST 
HIM.
NOTHING I
MATT: TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
INNING ASK WE 
ANSWER THE AFLAC
QUESTION.
WHO IS THE FIRST
MANAGER OF THE 
RANGERS?
TED WILLIAMS, 
MANAGED THE TEAM
FOR 3 YEARS IN 
WASHINGTON AND 
THEN MOVED WITH 
THE TEAM TO 
ARLINGTON FOR 
THEIR IN
THEIR INNAGURAL 
SEASON, HERE.
TED WILLIAMS, IS
DO AS I DO, NOT 
AS A SAY, AND 
TED WAS ALWAYS 
FRUSTRATED WITH 
THE FACT THAT 
PLAYERS COULDN'T
DO PHYSICALLY 
WHAT HE WAS ABLE
TO DO IN THEIR 
SPOTS AND NEVER 
HAD ANY SUCCESS 
MANAGING WHAT 
WAS IN HIS 
DEFENSE A BAD 
RANGERS TEAM. 
MARK: A BAD, BAD
TEAM, AND THEN 
YOU GO ON -- 
THERE'S TOM 
GRIEV WHO USED 
TO BE THE 
MANAGER FOR THE 
TEXAS RANGERS 
AND HE PLAYED 
FOR TED 
WILLIAMS, HERE 
IN TEXAS, FATHER
OF BEN GRIEV.
MATT: HANK 
BLALOCK WITH 1 
GONE, HE SINGLED
IN THAT FIRST 
INNING SCORE FOR
THE RANGERS.
YOU KNOW, THE 
RANGERS WHEN 
THEY FIRST MOVED
HERE, THEY DID 
NOT HAVE A LOT 
OF CONTINUITY IN
THAT MANAGERIAL 
SEAT, IN FACT, 
BEFORE BOBBY 
VALENTINE SPENT 
ALMOST EIGHT 
YEARS HERE AS A 
MANAGER, THE 
LONGEST STINT 
THAT ANY RANGER 
MANAGER HAD WAS 
3 YEARS.
MARK: LET ME 
GUESS SOME GUYS 
IN BETWEEN.
WHITEY HERZOG, 
BILLY MARTIN, 
BUDDY BELL -- 
NO, HE PLAYED 
HERE.
MATT: RIGHT.
DONE ZIMMER 
PLAYED HERE, 
FRANK LACASEY 
MANAGED HERE FOR
3-PLUS YEARS.
THERE'S A LINE 
DRIVE FOR A HIT.
BLA INTLA A PURE
HITTER AS HE 
SINGLES INTO 
LEFT, 2 FOR 2 
TONIGHT.
MARK: SHARPLY 
LIT TO LEFT, AND
HE CAN TURN ON 
ONE AND PUT IT 
OUT OF THE 
BALLPARK AND 
HURT YOU THAT 
WAY, TOOCHLT 
SECOND TIME THIS
EVENING HE HAS 
GONE THE 
OPPOSITE WAY.
MATT: SO A 1-OUT
BATTER IN FRONT 
OF MARK DeROSA 
NOW.
HE GROUNDED INTO
A FIELDER'S 
CHOICE PLAY THAT
ENDED THE FIRST.
FIRST BATTER 
AGAINST MIKE 
THOMPSON SINCE 
THE FIRST 
INNING.
IT ENDS A 
STRETCH OF 8 IN 
A ROW RETIRED.
SO FAR SO GOOD 
FOR MIKE IN HIS 
FIRST GO-ROUND 
AGAINST AN 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
OPPONENT.
IT'S ONTHING 
WHEN YOU'RE -- 
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
GETTING THAT 
FIRST-EVER START
AGAINST THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
AGAINST THE 
ROYALS AT HOME, 
YOU KNOW, BUT HE
HAPPENS TO BE 
DEALING TO ONE 
OF THE MOST 
POTENT TEAMS IN 
BASEBALL ON HIR 
HOME TURF IN HIS
FIRST GO-ROUND.
MARK: IT'S A 
HIGH, FASTBALL 
HITTING TEAM.
THEY LIKE THE 
FASTBALL.
YOU CAN JUDGE 
THAT.
SO WHAT DO YOU 
DO?
YOU TAKE THE 
STING OUT OF THE
BAT.
HE'S THROWING 
CHANGE-UPS, 
PITCHING 
BACKWARDS, ON A 
FASTBALL COUNT 
HE WILL FLIP UP 
A BREAKING BALL,
TAKE A LITTLE 
OFF HIS FASTBALL
AND TRY TO MAKE 
THEM FISH FOR 
PITCHES LIKE 
THAT WHEN HE'S 
AHEAD.
I CAN GUARANTEE 
YOU ONE THING 
MIKE THOMPSON IN
A 2-2 COUNT WITH
A RUNNER ON HE'S
NOT GOING TO 
THROW A FASTBALL
FOR A STRIKE 
DOWN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE PLATE.
MATT: SAN 
DIEGO'S TURNED 1
DOUBLE PLAY 
TONIGHT, MARK 
DeROSA LINES UP 
THE MIDDLE AND 
WENT OUT AND GOT
THAT BALL.
BACK-TO-BACK 
1-OUT SIN GELS, 
AND TEXAS IS IN 
BUSINESS HERE IN
THE 4TH.
MARK: WE 
MENTIONED IN THE
PREGAME SHOW HOW
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THE BALL DOWN 
AND MARK DeROSA 
GOES DOWN AND 
GETS THAT ONE.
AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT, IF HE 
REACHES FOR IT 
LIKE THAT, HITS 
IT IN THE SWEET 
SPOT, A 1-HOPPER
TO CENTER FIELD 
YOU'LL TAKE IT.
YOU WOULD RATHER
HAVE HIM DO THAT
THAN HAVE A 
2-RUN SHOT.
MATT: SO NOW 
KEVIN MENCH, THE
D.H., HE HAS 
BEEN SWINGING A 
HOT BAT WITH 9 
KNOCKS IN HIS 
LAST 8 GAMES.
SPEAKING OF 
STREAKS, IT 
WASN'T TOO LONG 
AGO BACK IN 
APRIL THAT KEVIN
MENCH PUT 
TOGETHER A VERY 
IMPRESSIVE 
STREAK, TOMORROW
SON WORKING TO 
HIM OUT OF THE 
STRETCH AND MISS
TO GO MAKE IT 
2-0.
HOME RUNS IN 7 
CONSECUTIVE 
GAMES AND IN 
FACT, MISSED 
TYING A MAJOR 
LEAGUE RECORD 
FOR HOME RUNS IN
CONSECUTIVE 
AFFAIRS.
A BOUNCING BALL 
TO THIRD.
CASTILLA TO 
BLUM, THAT'S ALL
THEY GET AS THEY
CUT DOWN THE 
MIDDLEMAN, NO 
RELAY THROW, 
RUNNERS AT THE 
CORNER IS WITH 2
GONE.
MARK: LOOKED 
LIKE BLUM AT 
SECOND BASE 
COULDN'T FIND 
THE HANDLE.
CASTILLA GOT THE
BALL NICE AND 
MADE A FEED TO 
GEOFF.
HE CANNOT FIND 
IT.
MATT: NOW THE 
SOUTH SWINGING 
BRAD WILKERSON, 
HE GROUNDED TO 
SHORT IN HIS 
FIRST AT-BAT 
TONIGHT.
BOUNCING BALL TO
SECOND.
SO BACK-TO-BACK 
1-OUT SINGLES, 
BUT THE RANGERS 
ARE TURNED AWAY 
IN THE 4TH.
TIED.AT INSURANCE ?
WHAT INSURANCE
IS THAT YOGI ?
AFLAC.
[ Duck grunts ]
THE ONE YA' REALLY
NEED TO HAVE...
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED IT.
NEED WHAT ?
AFLAC.
WELL, IF YOU GET HURT
AND MISS WORK IT WON'T HURT
TO MISS WORK.
HUH ?
AND THEY GIVE YA' CASH
WHICH IS JUST AS GOOD AS MONEY.
AFLAC.
ASK ABOUT IT AT WORK.
[ Duck grunts ]
MATT: AFTER A 
STRONG START 
OFFENSIVELY, 
THIS HAS SETTLED
INTO A PITCHERS 
DO YOU LIVE 
DUAL, 1-1 TIE, 
AS CASTILLA 
LEADS THINGS 
OFF, CASTILLA, 
JOHNSON AND 
CAMERON HERE 
AGAINST VICENTE 
PADILLA, A RUN 
ON HITS FOR BOTH
THE RANGERS AND 
THE PADRES HERE 
TONIGHT.
VINNY SENDS ONE 
INTO RIGHT 
CENTER FIELD, 
MARK DeROSA AND 
GARY MATTHEWS 
ARE BACK, LOOK 
AT VINNY, A 
DOUBLES MACHINE.
A PAIR OF 
2-BAGGERS FOR 
VINNY TO START 
THE NIGHT.
MARK: DO YOU 
WANT ME TO SAY 
IT OR NOT?
MATT: SAY IT.
MARK: IT'S AN IN
AND OUT NIGHT 
FORECAST 
CASTILLA, 
DOUBLE/DOUBLE W.
YOU KNOW HE PUT 
SOME CHEESE ON 
THAT ONE.
VINNY TOO HOT 
FOR TV, 
UNDESCRIBABLE.
HE'S DOING 
DAMAGE WITHIN 
HIS 10TH DOUBLE.
VINNY SAID HE'S 
BEEN DOING 
DAMAGE SINCE 
HE'S BEEN SIX 
YEARS OLD, 
SWINGING THE 
BAT.
MATT: HERE IS 
BEN JOHNSON, AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO 
DO SOME DAMAGE 
HERE, A RUNNER 
IN SCORING 
POSITION.
MARK: GOT TO 
KNOCK IT TO THE 
RIGHT SIDE, MARK
TEIXEIRA IS 
PLAYING WELL OFF
THE BAG AT FIRST
BASE.
MATT: HOW ABOUT 
VINNY, THOUGH, 
MUDCAT?
WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT A VETERAN 
GUY WHO A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAD 
WRITTEN OFF AS 
DONE.
BEN JOHNSON INTO
THE CORNER, 
THAT'S TROUBLE.
FOUL IN RIGHT.
MARK: OH, MAN!
MATT: WOW!
IT LOOKED LIKE 
THIS BALL 
DROPPED INTO 
FAIR TERRITORY, 
BUT FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE BILL 
WILKIE WAS ON 
IT.
MARK: FROM OUR 
VANT VANTAGE UP 
HERE IN THE 
BOOTH, THAT 
RIGHT FIELD 
DISAPPEARS ON 
US.
HE GETS THAT 
BALL QUICKER OUT
IN FRONT, THAT'S
TROUBLE.
HE JUST MISSED 
IT.
MATT: AND HE 
SHOOTS THAT ONE 
FOUL.
MARK: WHAT'S 
WITH THESE NETS?
THERE'S ONE DOWN
THE LEFT FIELD 
LINE AND ONE 
DOWN THE RIGHT 
FIELD LINE.
MATT: PERFECTLY 
LEGAL.
MARK: REALLY?
MATT: YEAH.
I THINK IT'S UP 
TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL CLUB 
AS FAR AS IF 
THEY HAVE A NET 
POLICY BUT THERE
IS NOTHING ON 
THE MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL LINE 
THAT SAYS YOU 
CAN'T BRING A 
FISHING NET TO 
THE BALL GAME.
MARK: I SEE THAT
GUY HAS ONE.
IS THAT 
SPIELBERG?
MATT: THAT GUY 
LOOKED LIKE THE 
ACTOR, DANIEL --
ANYWAY, JOHNSON 
SHOOTS IT INTO 
THE CORNER, 
AGAIN FOUL.
HE'S REALLY 
PLAYING WITH 
RIGHT FIELD 
HERE.
YOU GOT TO LIKE 
THE APPROACH, 
LOOKING TO SEND 
STUFF INTO THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER 
AND JOHNSON HAS 
BEEN WIDE ON T. 
MARK: IF A 
PITCHER IS OUT 
ON THE MOUND AND
HE KEEPS SEEING 
THAT, LET'S SEE 
IF HE TRIES TO 
BUZZ ONE INSIDE 
ON HIM, HERE.
MATT: WHAT'S THE
NAME OF THIS 
GUY, MUDCAT?
DANIEL STERN.
MARK: GUY FROM 
"CITY SLICKERS?"
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: NO POINT 
ON THAT ONE, MY 
FRIEND.
MATT: PARTIALLY 
OBSCURED BY THE 
VISOR.
2-2 NOW.
MARK: I'M COMING
RIGHT BACK 
INSIDE HERE, 
NOW, MATTY.
MATT: OKAY.
MIKE CAMERON 
NEXT.
CASTILLA 
REPRESENTING THE
GO-AHEAD RUN ON 
SECOND BASE.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOING AWAY,
THOUGH.
MATT: 1 AWAY AND
STRUCK HIM OUT.
MARK: WELL, IT'S
THE RIGHT PITCH,
OBVIOUSLY, FROM 
VICENTE PADILLA,
AND THE REASON 
WHY I THINK HE 
WENT BACK OUT 
THERE IS BECAUSE
HE WOULD RATHER 
MISS DOWN AND 
AWAY TO BEN 
JOHNSON RATHER 
THAN TRYING TO 
COME OVER THE 
PLATE AND 
GETTING HURT.
EARL IN THE 
COUNT BEN HAD 
THE RIGHT 
APPROACH AND 
PADILLA WINS THE
BATTLE ON THAT 
ONE.
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON TRYING 
TO PICK UP THE 
BATTER, FASTBALL
STAYS HIGH TO 
MIKE.
CAMERON 0-2 
TONIGHT SO FAR 
TONIGHT.
SEE IF I CAN 
PICK UP VINNY TO
MAKE IT A 2-1 
SAN DIEGO GAME.
WE MENTIONED HOW
THE ALL-TIME 
SEASON SERIES 
BETWEEN -- THE 
ALL-TIME SERIES 
THAT IS BETWEEN 
TEXAS AND SAN 
DIEGO IS EVEN AT
8 APIECE. THE 
PADRES ARE 6-2 
IN SAN DIEGO, 
2-6 HERE AT THE 
BALLPARK IN 
ARLINGTON.
THERE ARE SO 
MANY NAMES AND 
FACES THAT ARE 
DIFFERENT ON 
THIS ROSTER.
COMPARING IT TO 
THE LAST ONE 
THAT PLAYED THE 
RANGERS IN 
INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY.
ABOUT THE ONLY 
REAL 
CONSISTENCY, 
HERE, STARTS AT 
THE TOP WITH 
BRUCE BOCHY.
3 BALLS AND NO 
STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO 
CAMERON.
LET'S SEE HOW 
CAREFUL VICENTE 
PADILLA IS WITH 
A BASE OPEN AND 
ONE GONE.
3-1.
MARK: EVEN 
LOOKED LIKE 
PADILLA ON THAT 
3-0 PITCH EASED 
UP A LITTLE BIT.
IT WASN'TS THE 
100% EFFORT ON 
THAT FASTBALL.
HITTING THE 
CORNER TO MAKE 
IT 3-1.
HE MIGHT THROW 
HIM A BREAKING 
BALL HERE.
MATT: INSTEAD 
IT'S BALL 4.
HE THREW HIM A 
FASTBALL THERE 
ON 3-1.
WOW.
DON'T EVEN 
BOTHER WIPING 
IT, DUDE.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: I THINK HE
STILL HAS PART 
OF A HOT DOG 
FROM A COWBOYS 
GAME LEFT OVER 
FROM THE FALL IN
THAT THING.
[CHUCKLES] HERE 
IS BLUM WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND.
MARK: WE NEED AN
EXTRA-BASE HIT 
HERE, MATTY.
MATT: BLUM 0-2 
SO FAR TONIGHT.
MARK: GOOD TIME 
TO BREAK OUT THE
RALLY STICK.
THAT TOOK CARE 
OF THE MONKEY 
STICK IN 
ANAHEIM, HUH?
MATT: I USED TO 
HATE THE RALLY 
MONKEY.
I LIKE HIM NOW.
THE THINGS 
THEY'VE DONE 
WITH HIM ON THE 
SCOREBOARD?
1-1 TO BLUM.
THESE ARE 
SITUATIONS WHERE
VICENTE PADILLA 
HAS GOTTEN 
TOUGH.
WITH RUNNERS IN 
SCORING POSITION
HITTERS ARE 
HITTING .31 
.217, AND WITH 
NO ONE ABOARD, 
HE'S LETTING THE
HITTERS HIT 
.302.
2 GONE IN THE 
SWIRLING WIND, 
AND HANK IS ABLE
TO MAKE THAT 
CATCH. IT IS 
BLOWING TONIGHT.
MARK: SOME FRIAR
FAITHFUL HERE IN
ARLINGTON.
SPORTING THE 
CAMEL JERSEY.
MATT: SO NOW IT 
WILL BE UP TO 
GILES WITH 2 
GONE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE WHAT VICENTE
PADILLA DID THAT
AT-BAT, MATTY?
OFF SPEED, 
POPPING HIM UP 
IN THE INFIELD.
AND WITH ONE OUT
AND THAT POP-UP,
THE INFIELD FLY 
RULE WAS IN 
EFFECT.
BATTER OUT, 
RUNNERS ADVANCE 
AT YOUR OWN 
RISK.
MATT: PIAZZA 
NEXT WITH 2 
GONE.
HERE'S GILES WHO
SINGLED, IN HIS 
FIRST TRY TONE.
THAT BALL HITS 
HIM.
THE WAY BRIAN 
REACTED IT WAS 
ALMOST AS THOUGH
IT MISSED HIM 
AND IT WASN'T 
UNTIL THE UMPIRE
SAID "TAKE YOUR 
BASE," THAT WE 
WERE SURE BRIAN 
WAS HIT BY THAT 
BALL.
MARK: THAT'S THE
FIRST PITCH HE 
THREW TO GEOFF 
BLUM AT THE 
AT-BAT, AUSHLGS 
AND IT GETS HIM 
RIGHT IN THE 
UNCLE HULKA, 
RIGHT ON THE BIG
TOE.
MATT: THIS IS 
WHERE SAN DIEGO 
NEEDS TO COME UP
WITH A BIG BLOW,
YOU DON'T NEED 
US TO TELL YOU 
THAT.
BIG BASES LOADED
CAREER NUMBERS.
SEEN PLENTY OF 
VICENTE PADILLA,
SACKS FULL, 2 
GONE, THIS IS 
SAN DIEGO'S BEST
OPPORTUNITY TO 
HANG A CROOKED 
NUMBER ALL 
NIGHT.
MARK: AND THE 
KEY IS FOR 
PIAZZA NOT TO 
PULL, SEE HIM 
TRYING THERE, 
MATTY, STAYING 
INSIDE OF IT 
NICELY?
MATT: PADILLA'S 
THROWN 88 
PITCHES TONIGHT,
AND I WOULD 
ALMOST SAY 
QUIETLY.
THAT PITCH COUNT
HAS RIS ENTO THE
POINT WHERE BUCK
SHOWALTER IS 
WATCHING THE 
NUMBER.
MARK: 33'S, 5'S, 
AND 8'S.
MATT: HERE IS 
THE NOTHING-1 TO
PIAZZA, SWUNG ON
AND SHOT INTO 
RIGHT FIELD, THE
BASE HIT WILL 
SCORE A RUN, 
THEY'LL WAVE 
MIKE CAMERON 
AROUND.
PIAZZA COMES 
THROUGH WITH THE
BASES LOADED.
ON QUE, PARTNER,
MUD TALKED ABOUT
MIKE LOOKING TO 
RIGHT FIELD AND 
ON THE SECOND 
PITCH OF THE 
AT-BAT, THAT'S 
WHERE THE LOVE 
COMES, OUT TO 
RIGHT FIELD AS 
HE DRIVES IN A 
PAIR TO MAKE IT 
3-1 FRIARS.
MARK: OH LOTTA 
LOVE.
TO RIGHT CENTER.
OH YEAH, BELIEVE
THAT.
MATT: IT WILL 
BRING THE 
PITCHING COACH, 
MARK CONNOR OUT 
TO THE MOUND FOR
THE FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
MIKE PIAZZA 
GIVES THE PADRES
A 2-RUN LEAD 
HERE IN THE 5TH.
MARK: THAT BALL 
GOES ON THE 
OUTSIDE AND 
PIAZZA STAYS ON 
IT NICELY.
WITH 2 OUTS, 
TREVOR HOFFMAN 
IS WAVING AROUND
CAMERON, RUNNING
ON THE HIT, 
RUNNING ON 
CONTACT.
MATT: THAT IS A 
VINTAGE PIAZZA 
SWING, TOO.
IT ALMOST LOOKS 
LIKE MIKE'S 
WEIGHT IS 
SHIFTING TOWARD 
HIS BACK LEG 
FROM THE MOMENT 
THE PITCH LEAVES
THE HEAD.
IT LOOKS LIKE 
HE'S ON HIS 
HEELS.
AND HE'S LIENING LEANING 
BACK.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
UP NOW, 0-1 TO 
HIM.
AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR MORE NOW 
WITH SAN DIEGO'S
HOTEST POWER BAT
ON THE TRIP.
GILES AT SECOND,
PIAZZA THE 
RUNNER AT FIRST,
2 RUNS IN WITH 2
GONE.
HE WAS LEADING 
OFF THE SECOND 
AND ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ 
DELIVERED OUR 
COORS LITE HIT.
A DRIVING HOME 
RUN, NO. 10 OF 
THE YEAR AND 
THAT TIED US ONE
APIECE.
MARK: LOOKS 
LIKE -- BRING A 
GLOVE TO THE 
BALLPARK NEXT 
TIME, BUDDY.
MATT: ADRIAN 
BEHIND HERE, 
0-2.
MARK: TONIGHT 
ANOTHER POINT 
ABOUT PAD YASHGS
MATTY, I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM GET 
HURT ON BREAKING
BALLS.
ALL OF HIS 
PITCHES, 
TONIGHT, I THINK
ON HITS THAT 
HAVE REALLY 
MATTERED HAVE 
BEEN ON THE 
FASTBALL.
HE'S MISSING 
WITH LOCATION ON
THE FASTBALL.
MATT: REMEMBER 
THE CRITICISM ON
PADILLA FOR A 
COUPLE OF YEARS 
IN PHILLY WAS 
FOCUS.
MARK: YES.
MATT: GONZALEZ 
SHOOTS THAT ONE 
FOUL.
HE HAD, AT 
TIMES, A RATHER 
ACRIMONIOUS 
RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE FRONT 
OFFICE 
PERSONNEL, AND 
EVEN COACHING 
STAFF IN 
PHILADELPHIA.
THERE WAS MORE 
THAN 1 BASEBALL 
PUNDANT THAT 
LOOKED AT THAT 
TRADE AND SAID
VICENTE PADILLA 
MORE THAN 
SERVICEABLE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
STARTER AND HE 
WAS EXCHANGED 
FOR NOT A WHOLE 
LOT IN 
COMPENSATION, 
ALMOST TO 
INDICATE THE 
PHILLIES WANTED 
TO UNLOAD HIM.
HE GETS ADRIAN 
HERE WITH A 
PITCH THAT 
CATCHES THE 
OUTSIDE CORNER.
THE DAMAGE DONE,
THOUGH, THE 
PIAZZA 2-RUN 
SINGLE MAKES IT 
3-1 SAN DIEGO.
MATT: PADRE 
FANS, HERE IN 
TEXAS THESE 
DAYS, A LOT OF 
FANS HAVE MADE 
THE TRIP TO 
ARLINGTON.
WE'RE NOT SURE 
IF THEY TRAVELED
IN FROM SAN 
DIEGO OR IF 
THEY'RE 
DISPLACED SAN 
DIEGO PEOPLE, WE
WELCOME THEM.
A DRIVE INTO 
CENTER FIELD 
THAT GETS OVER 
MIKE CAMERON, WE
HAVEN'T SAID 
THAT OFTEN THIS 
YEAR.
AND A 
FIRST-PITCH 
DOUBLE GREETS 
TWOM TOMORROW IN
THE LAST OF THE 
5TH.
MARK: MATTY, 
TALKED TO A LOT 
OF OUTFIELDER, 
AND IT'S TOUGH 
TO JUDGE THAT 
BALL OFF THE BAT
WHEN IT'S HIT 
DIRECTLY AT YOU 
OVER YOUR HEAD.
HE SQUARES UP ON
THIS BALL NICELY
AND LOOK AT 
MIKE, RIGHT OVER
HIS HEAD, 
DIRECTLY OVER 
HIS HEAD.
KID HAS SOME 
POP, NOW.
MENTIONED IN THE
MINOR LEAGUES IN
'05 HE HIT 25 
HOME RUNS.
MATT: ROD 
BARAJAS WITH A 
CHANCE TO DRIVE 
IN A RUN NOW, 
IAN KINSLER AT 
SECOND TO LEAD 
THINGS OFF, AS 
BARAJAS TAKES A 
STRIKE.
HE HAS HEATED 
UP.
BY THE WAY, IT'S
NOT NEARLY AS 
HOT DOWN HERE AT
GAME TIME AS WE 
WERE FEARING.
WE WERE LOOKING 
FOR TEMPERATURES
STILL IN THE 
90S, AND GILES 
OVER PLAYS THE 
BALL, AND IT 
WOULDN'T MATTER,
IAN KINSLER WAS 
GOING TO SCORE 
ANYWAY, 
BACK-TO-BACK 
OPEN THE 5TH 
EXAMINE BRING 
THE RANGERS TO 
WITHIN A RUN.
MARK: IDEALLY 
YOU WOULD LIKE 
TO KEEP ROD 
BARAJAS ON FIRST
BASE.
HE DOESN'T RUN 
ALL THAT WELL.
BRIAN OVERRUNS 
THAT AND WITH 
THAT
MISQUE, AND ROD 
BARAJAS WILL 
TAKE THE EXTRA 
90 FEET.
MATT: BACK TO 
THE TOP OF THE 
ORDER NOW, GARY 
MATTHEWS, JUNIOR
WHO HAS WALKED 
AND FLIED TO 
LEFT.
GETTING INTO THE
SCARY PART OF 
THIS RANGER 
LINEUP NOW, AND 
THERE'S NO PLACE
TO HIDE IN IT, 
BUT EVERY TIME 
YOU LOOK AT GARY
MATTHEWS, YOUNG,
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
AND HANK 
BLALOCK, YOU GOT
TO WORK PRETTY 
HARD, HERE.
MARK: UH-HUH.
YOU SEE GARY 
MATTHEWS DID THE
FIRST PITCH?
HE SHOWED BUNT, 
AND VINNY WAS 
CREEPING IN AND 
SWINGING AWAY 
THE SECOND 
PITCH.
MATT: POPPED HIM
UP.
CAMERON IN FROM 
CENTER.
BOY, THAT'S A 
BIG OUT AS ROD 
BARAJAS HAS TO 
HOLD AT SECOND.
1 GONE.
I CAN'T TELL BY 
THE WAY, WHEN 
THAT -- I CAN'T 
TELL IF THE WIND
IS KNOCKING 
THINGS DOWN OR 
SWIRLING BALLS 
OR PUSHING THEM 
OUT.
IT SEEMS TO 
CHANGE WITH 
EVERY PITCH.
MARK: I'M RIGHT 
THERE WITH YOU.
I'M NOT SURE 
THEY'RE NOT 
HAVING 
DIFFICULTY 
PICKING THE BALL
UP WHEN IT GOES 
UP IN THE AIR 
WITH THE 
SIGNAGE.
THE HOTEL LOOK 
OUT THERE IN 
CENTER, THE 
OUTDOOR MOTEL 
LOOK, THERE?
MATT: YEAH, 
THAT'S OFFICE 
SPACE UP THERE 
I'M TOLD.
MARK: YEAH.
MATT: SO IT'S 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
NOW, 0-2 
TONIGHT.
I KNOW THAT TROY
AIKMAN USED TO 
HAVE AN OFFICE 
OUT THERE, IT 
USED TO BE AN 
OFFICE 
DESTINATION 
ADDRESS, BUT I'M
NOT SURE THAT'S 
TRUE.
THIS IS A PRETTY
BALLPARK.
MARK: YES, IT 
IS.
MATT: BACK UP 
THE MIDDLE, A 
BASE HIT, ROD 
BARAJAS IS BEING
WAVED AROUND, 
MIKE CAMERON UP 
AND THROWING, IT
GETS AWAY FROM 
BARD AND YOUNG 
IS ON HIS WAY TO
THIRD.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] TIED 
AT 3 WITH THE 
GO-AHEAD RUN 90 
FEET AWAY AND 
STIM ONLY 1 OUT.
MARK: THAT'S THE
THING ABOUT THIS
TEXAS RANGERS 
TEAM, WE KNOW 
THEY CAN HIT AND
WE SURELY KNOW 
THAT A 2-RUN 
LEAD, 3-RETURN 
LEAD IS NEVER 
SAFE.
THEY CAN 
DEFINITELY SNAEK
UP ON YOU.
I'M GUESSING 
THAT'S GOING TO 
BE A SINGLE, 
SECOND ON THE 
THROW AND AN 
E-8, ALLOWING 
YOUNG TO GO TO 
THIRD BASE.
WE'LL HAVE TO 
SIT BACK FOR THE
OFFICIAL SCORE.
70 PITCHES FOR 
MIKE THOMPSON 
AND REALLY NOT 
THE BEST RATIO, 
BUT STILL A LOT 
OF WORK TO DO 
WITH THE 
GO-AHEAD RUN 90 
FEET AWAY.
MATT: SO NOW 
MARK TEIXEIRA IN
A SPOT WHERE A 
FLY BALL CAN 
RECLAIM THE 
RANGERS' LEAD.
HOW ABOUT A BASE
HIT?
YOUNG SCORES 
EASILY, AN 
R.B.I. KNOCK FOR
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
HIS SECOND BASE 
HIT OF THE GAME,
AND IT'S 4-3 
RANGERS.
MARK: JUST LIKE 
THAT, MATTY.
4 OUT OF 5 GUYS 
COMING TO THE 
PLATE HAVE 
GOTTEN KNOCKS IN
THIS TEXAS 5TH.
MATT: LOOKS LIKE
DARREN BALSLEY 
IS MAYBE A PITCH
OR TWO AWAY FROM
MAKING A VISIT.
HERE IS HANK 
BLALOCK, 2 FOR 
2, HIS FIRST 
BASE HIT HAVING 
SCORED A RUN.
NOBODY UP IN THE
SAN DIEGO 
BULLPEN.
BRIAN SIKORSKI 
IS JUST ABOUT TO
GWYNN A WARM-UP 
ASSIGNMENT NOW.
STILL A 
MANAGEABLE PITCH
COUNT FOR MIKE 
THOMPSON.
THAT'S NOT THE 
ISSUE.
IT'S AN 
EFFECTIVENESS 
PROBLEM.
FOUR OF THE FIVE
BATTERS HE FACED
HAVE REACHED 
SAFELY AND 3 OUT
OF 4 OF THOSE 
GUYS HAVE 
SCORED.
2-1 ON BLALOCK.
TEAM THAT'S 
HITTING OVER 300
IN THE MONTH OF 
JUNE.
THEY HAVE WON 3 
IN A ROW.
YOU DIDN'T 
EXPECT THE 
RANGERS TO 
SUDDENLY GO COLD
AT THE END OF A 
10-GAME HOME 
STAND.
MARK: NO.
HOW ABOUT THE 
LAST 10 GAMES 
FOR THE RANGERS,
MATTY?
THEY'RE HITTING 
.535 THE LAST 10
GAMES.
MATT: 
IRONICALLY, PLAY
BLA HAD BEEN ONE
OF THOSE NOT 
SWINGING THE BAT
EFFECTIVELY, 
ALTHOUGH HE IS 2
FOR 2 TONIGHT.
HE HAD BEEN 4 
FOR 17 COMING 
INTO THIS 
SERIES.
WHEN THEY CAN 
HAVE GUYS LIKE 
HANK BLALOCK AND
MARK TEIXEIRA 
NOT HITTING AND 
STILL WINNING, 
GETTING BACK 
INTO FIRST 
PLACE, THINGS 
ARE GOING GOOD.
THERE'S A FLY 
BALL TO CENTER, 
JOHNSON CALLING 
FOR IT.
2 GONE AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA STAYS 
AT FIRST.
SO NOW MARK 
DeROSA.
YOU KNOW, MARK 
DeROSA MIGHT BE 
THE BEST EXAMPLE
OF A GUY THAT 
HAS BENEFITED 
FROM A SPECIFIC 
HITTING COACH.
LONG-TIME 
HITTING 
INSTRUCTOR, 
HERE, RUDY 
JARAMILLO, WHO 
HAS MISSED SOME 
TIME, ACTUAL, 
BUT HE CREDITS 
RUDY JARAMILLO, 
AND HE'S NEVER 
HIT CLOSE TO THE
.333 HE'S 
HITTING NOW.
A BROKEN BAT AND
BASE HIT INTO 
RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE 
A PERMIT FOR 
THAT PIECE OF 
WOOD RIGHT NOW.
THAT IS REALLY A
SCARY BREAK.
MARK: THAT BAT 
DIED HAPPY, 
RIGHT?
BASE KNOCK.
RUDY JARAMILLO 
THE HITTING 
COACH WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH 
PROSTATE CANCER,
AND A LOT OF 
THESE HITTING 
COACHES HAVE THE
SAME APPROACH, 
THEY TRY TO GO 
THE OTHER WAY, 
THAT WAS A 
PERFECT EXAMPLE.
RUDY JARAMILLO 
WAS UNDER 
HITTING COACH 
HOUSTON, AND -- 
THERE'S RUDY.
MATT: YEAH, 
OZZIE GIAN PAID 
HIM A COMPLEMENT
EARL, HOW GOOD 
IS RUDY 
JARAMILLO?
HE GOT MARK 
DeROSA TO HIT 
.333, HE'S A 
GENIUS.
KIND OF A 
BACK-HANDED 
COMPLEMENT AT 
MARK DeROSA'S 
EXPENSE.
SO MENCH, WHO IS
HITLESS TONIGHT,
A BALL AND A 
STRIKE ON THE 
D.H., MENCH.
BUT AS WE KNOW, 
IT'S ABOUT THE 
PLAYERS, RIGHT?
MARK: 
ABSOLUTELY.
MATT: THINGS GO 
BAD, COACHES GET
THE BLAME.
THINGS GO WELL, 
PLAYERS GET THE 
CREDIT.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS 
FAIR, IT'S A 
REA. 
MARK: I KNOW 
THERE'S 2 OUTS, 
SO WE HAVE TO 
WAIT ON THIS 
PITCH.
I PUT IT IN THE 
SAME ANALOGY OF 
A TEACHER WHO 
HAS A CLASS.
THIS TEACHER 
PREPARES AND 
PREPARES AND 
PREPARES AND 
GIVES ALL THE 
INFORMATION TO 
THE STUDENTS.
THE TEST IS 
COMING UP THIS 
FRIDAY, HERE IS 
WHAT YOU NEED TO
KNOW, GOING OVER
THE PLANS, AND A
LOT OF CLASS IS 
FAILING, BUT THE
TEACHER IS 
TRYING TO 
PREPARE THESE 
STUDENTS TO DO 
THE BEST THEY 
CAN.
SOMETIMES IT'S 
THE STUDENTS.
MATT: EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE A 
MR. HAND GETS A 
JEFF SPICOLLI.
4-3 RANGERS.
S 
MATT: STAY TUNED
AFTER THE GAME 
WITH 
APRIL 1-ON-1 
WITH JANE 
MITCHELL, ON 
MIKE CAMERON AND
ERIC YOUNG.
IT'S ALL COMING 
UP AFTER THE 
GAME TONIGHT.
VICENTE PADILLA 
WORKING WITH A 
LEAD, AS THE 
RANGERS GET 3 
AFTER VICENTE 
PADILLA GAVE UP 
2 IN HIS HALF OF
THE 5TH AND WITH
THAT 1-RUN LEAD 
HE MAKES BARD 
GROUND OUT, SO 1
GONE FOR VICENTE
PADILLA.
6, 7, 8 BATTERS 
IN THE SAN DIEGO
6TH.
MARTY FELDMAN UP
IN THE RANGER 
BULLPEN.
SCOTT FELDMAN UP
AND GETTING 
HIMSELF PREPARED
TONIGHT.
MARK: WHAT ARE 
THE CHANCES OF 
HIS NICKNAME 
BEING MARTY?
MATT: I DON'T 
KNOW THAT 
THEY'RE THAT 
GOOD, WHAT IS 
SCOTT FELDMAN, 
28, 29 YEARS 
OLD?
MARK: SO YOU'RE 
SAYING THE YOUNG
BREED OF OF 
PLAYERS MIGHT 
NOT KNOW WHO THE
ACTOR WAS?
MATT: I THINK IT
WOULD TAKE A 
COACH TO HANG 
THAT NAME ON 
HIM, OR A 
VETERAN GUY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
MANY GUYS COMING
UP FROM 
SAN FRANCISCO 
ARE GOING TO BE 
FAMILIAR WITH 
THE 
OPTICALLY-
CHALLENGED 
CHARACTER ACTOR.
GREENIE HAS HIS 
FIRST KNOCK OF 
THE BALL GAME, 
UPRIGHT FIELD.
NOW VINNY 
CASTILLA WITH A 
PAIR OF DOUBLES 
TONIGHT, HE HAS 
BEEN SAN DIEGO'S
TOUGHEST OUT AND
THAT WILL DRAW A
VISIT FROM BUCK 
SHOWALTER.
DID YOU SEE 
VICENTE PADILLA 
YA CRACK A SMILE
THERE?
THAT'S GOING TO 
BE IT.
A 1-OUT WARNING.
A PITCHING 
CHANGE IS 
BROUGHT TO YOU 
BY MOTOWORLD.
WE'LL BE BACK.
MATT: SO VICENTE
PADILLA IS GONE 
AFTER 5 AND 
1/3RD.
EVERY TIME I SEE
HIM WITH THE CAP
OFF THAT IS 
BORIS FROM THE 
ROCKY AND 
BULLWINKLE SHOW.
FELDMAN IS A 23 
YEAR OLD RIGHT 
HANDER, WHO HAS 
BEEN IMPRESSIVE 
AGAINST 
RIGHT-HANDED 
HITTING, WILL 
TRY TO SHUTDOWN 
CASTILLA HERE.
MARK: WE TALK 
ABOUT THE 
MATCH-UPS, AND 
THAT'S WHY BUCK 
WENT OUT TO GET 
THE RIGHTY.
RIGHTIES ARE 
ONLY HITTING 
VERY LITTLE OFF 
THE RIGHT 
HANDER.
VERY TOUGH TO 
PICK UP THAT 
BALL.
MATT: THE 
RANGERS BULLPEN 
HAS BEEN VERY 
GOOD AS A GROUP 
IN NOT ALLOWING 
INHERITED 
BATTERS TO CROSS
THE PLATE.
ONLY 25% OF 
TWHOES INHERITED
HAVE COME AROUND
TO SCORE.
THAT'S THE 
LOWEST 
PERCENTAGE AMONG
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
BULLPENS.
GREENE WITH A 
COMFORTABLE LEAD
OFF FIRST AND 
THE PITCH MISSES
UP TO VINNY, 
1-1.
IN OTHER 
CATEGORIES, WHEN
YOU AVERAGE OUT 
THEIR RANKINGS, 
THEY RANK AROUND
THE MIDDLE OF 
THE PACK IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
CASTILLA SENDS A
FLY BALL TO 
RIGHT CENTER, 
TOO HIGH TO DO 
ANY DAMAGE THIS 
TIME.
MARK DeROSA IS 
UNDER IT, AND 
THAT'S THE FIRST
TIME VINNY HAS 
BEEN RETIRED 
TONIGHT.
MARK: YOU CAN 
SEE WHY HE HAS 
SUCH GREAT 
NUMBERS AGAINST 
RIGHTIES, THE 
DIFFERENT ANGLE,
IT'S NOT A 
SIDEARMER THAT 
IS THROWING 70, 
75 
MILE-PER-HOUR, 
HE'S GETTING UP 
THERE IN THE 
UPPER
UPPER 80'S, AND 
HE HAS A LOT ON 
THAT SINKER HE 
THROWS.
MATT: SO NOW BEN
JOHNSON WITH A 
RUNNER ABOARD 
AND 2 GONE.
BENNY HAS HAD 
RUNNERS ABOARD 
IN ALL OF HIS 
AT-BATS, SO FAR 
AND HE TAKES A 
STRIKE.
THIS HAS TO BE 
ANOTHER TOUGH 
SPOT FOR BEN IN 
THAT HE KNOWS 
WHEN DAVE 
ROBERTS COMES 
BACK, HE WILL BE
REACTIVATED, AND
THERE'S GOING TO
BE ANOTHER MOVE,
AND BEN'S BEST 
SHOT AT STICKING
AROUND IS TO 
PLAY OUT OF HIS 
TREE FOR THE 
NEXT TWO WEEKS 
OR SO UNTIL DAVE
RETURNS AND THAT
CAN LEAD TO ALL 
KINDS OF 
ADDITIONAL 
PRESSURES.
MARK: HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO
REALLY GO OFF, 
HIT THE BALL OUT
OF THE BALLPARK,
COME UP WITH 
HUGE HITS, HIT 
FOR HIGH 
AVERAGE, DRIVE 
GUYS IN, IN 
ORDER TO MAKE A 
TOUGH DECISION 
WHEN IT COMES TO
MAKING ROSTER 
MOVES WHEN THE 
DOCTOR COMES 
BACK.
MATT: A CHANCE 
TO TALK TO BEN 
BEFORE THE GAME 
TODAY, HE KNOWS 
HE HAS TO GO OUT
THERE AND PLAY 
AS WELL AS HE 
CAN.
HE'S NOT GOING 
TO GET CAUGHT UP
IN GOING 4 FOR 5
EVERY NIGHT.
LEFT CENTER 
ELD, THAT'S 
GOING TO SCORE A
RUN AS GREENE IS
AROUND THIRD.
JOHNSON IS INTO 
SECOND WITH AN 
R.B.I. DOUBLE TO
TIE US AT 4.
ON QUE, BENNY 
DELIVERS.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
BEN WENT DOWN 
AND GOT THIS 
PITCH, ALSO.
I MEAN, IT'S 
OUTER HALF, YOU 
CAN SEE THE 
UPPER HALF OF 
THE BODY GETS 
IT, AND HE'S 
TRYING TO GET 
INSURANCE OFF 
THE GEICO SIGN.
MATT: HE IS ONE 
OF THE RAW, AT 
TIMES SEEMINGLY 
UNREFINED 
TALENTS THAT THE
PADRES HAVE IN 
THEIR MINOR 
LEAGUE SYSTEM 
THAT AND YOU I 
WERE TALKING TO 
BOCH ABOUT 
YESTERDAY.
I'M A BIG FAN, I
KNOW YOU FEEL 
THE SAME WAY.
I LOVE WHAT HE 
BRINGS TO THE 
CLUB. HE HAS A 
LOT OF TOOLS.
HE HITS FOR 
POWER, CAN RUN, 
AND NOW MIKE 
CAMERON WITH A 
CHANCE TO 
REDELIVER A SAN 
DIEGO LEAD.
THE LEAD HAS 
ALREADY CHANGED 
HANDS TWICE 
TONIGHT.
WE'RE BACK TO 
EVEN, 4 APIECE.
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S BETTER?
BEN JOHNSON 
HITTING OFF 
FELDMAN WITH THE
GOOD NUMBERS 
HE'S HAD OFF 
RIGHTIES, SO HE 
GOT OFF THAT 
PITCH EXAMINE 
SQUARED UP ON IT
NICELY.
>> 1-1 FROM 
FELDMAN TO 
CAMERON.
THERE'S A DRIVE 
INTO THE 
OPPOSITE FIELD, 
THAT BALL HAS A 
CHANCE, MARK 
DeROSA BACK, HE 
LOOKS UP AND
IT'S GONE!
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON WAS IN 
EGYPT LAND.
CAMERON'S HOUSE 
IS LIKE A 
MUSEUM, VERY 
COLD AND YOU 
CAN'T TOUCH 
ANYTHING.
MIKE'S SECOND OF
THE TRIP, 5TH OF
THE YEAR, FRIARS
BACK ON TOP BY 
2.
MARK: OH, THAT 
BALL GOES RIGHT 
OVER THE HEART 
OF THE PLATE AND
MIKE, WATCH HIM 
STAY INSIDE THE 
BASEBALL NICELY.
HOW CLOSE?
WELL OUT OF THE 
REACH OF THE 
MARK DeROSA.
MATT: SO NOW 
GEOFF BLUM -- 
MARK: THE 
RIGHTIES JUST 
SEEM TO -- 
FELDMAN OUT 
THERE, YOU GOT 
YOUR .163 
BATTING AVERAGE.
MATT: COUPLE OF 
HOME RUNS FOR 
SAN DIEGO 
TONIGHT.
3 DOUBLES IN THE
ATTACK.
9 HITS APIECE, 
6-4 SAN DIEGO 
LEADS.
MARK: NICE SWING
BY CAMERON.
SWINGING THE BAT
WELL IN ANAHEIM.
>> THIS 
INTERLEAGUE 
THING AIN'T SUCH
A BAD THING.
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU ALL 
ALONG.
YOU KNOW, I'M A 
BIG PROPONENT OF
INTERLEAGUE PLAY
WHEN THE PADRES 
WIN.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: A SWING 
AND A MISS BY 
BLUM.
SAN DIEGO DOES 
MORE DAMAGE.
THEY HANG 3 IN 
THE 6TH.
AN R.B.I. DOUBLE
BY J
MATT: 6-4 
PADRES.
SAN DIEGO BACK 
ON TOP.
A REMINDER THAT 
COCA-COLA FAMILY
AND FRIENDS WEEK
ENDS ARE HERE.
LOG ONTO 
PADRES.COM AND 
GET 4 UPPER DECK
TICKETS AND 4 
HOT DOGS, AND 4 
COKES FOR ONLY 
$50.
WE TURN TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
6TH, AND A 
PITCHING CHANGE 
FOR SAN DIEGO, 
PADRES GO TO THE
BULLPEN FOR 
BRIAN SIKORSKI.
MARK: BRIAN 
SIKORSKI AGAINST
LEFT HANDERS, WE
HAVE SOME DUE UP
HERE, THEY ARE 
HITLESS 0-6 
AGAINST HIM, AND
WE KNOW HOW 
IMPORTANT IT IS 
TO GET THAT 
FIRST BATTER IN 
THE INNING.
MATT: FOR BRIAN 
SIKORSKI, THIS 
WILL BE HIS 
FIRST APPEARANCE
ON THE TRIP.
HE LAST WORKED 
AGAINST THE 
DODGERS, ON 
THURSDAY.
WE TALKED ABOUT 
IT IN ANAHEIM, 
WHERE 
OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR BRIAN TO GET
IN THE BALL GAME
HAVE BEEN 
SCARCE.
HE WILL BE 
LEANED ON HERE 
IN A BIG SPOT, 
NOT ONLY IN 
TERMS OF THE 
SCORE, TRYING TO
HOLD A 2-RUN 
LEAD BUT BRIAN 
SIKORSKI HAS 
ROOTS HERE IN AR
LINK TOVENLT HE 
BROKE INTO THE 
BIG LEAGUES WITH
THE RANGERS IN 
2000 AND, IN 
FACT, UNTIL SAN 
DIEGO CALLED HIM
UP THIS YEAR, 
HIS 10 
APPEARANCES WITH
THE BIG LEAGUE 
RANGERS IN 2000,
HIS ONLY MAJOR 
LEAGUE 
EXPERIENCE IN 
HIS 11-YEAR 
CAREER.
2 BALLS AND 2 
STRIKES TO 
BRIAN, RATHER TO
BRAD WILKERSON 
FROM BRIAN 
SIKORSKI.
AND A FULL COUNT
NOW, 3-2.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
BRIAN MAYBE A 
LITTLE STRONG 
OUT THERE, YOU 
KNOW?
SOMETIMES GUYS 
WHEN THEY'RE 
FEELING A LITTLE
FROGGY AND A 
LITTLE STRONG 
THEY'LL 
OVERTHROW A 
LITTLE BIT.
HE HAS 93, 94 ON
THAT FASTBALL.
THAT'S A PERFECT
EXAMPLE THAT HE 
HAS THE GOOD 
FASTBALL.
HE TRIES TO BURY
IS IN BRAD 
WILKERSON, BUT 
HE HIT THAT ONE,
FOULED IT OFF 
THE HANDLE.
HE WANTS TO GO 
AWAY, BUT HE 
JERKS IT ACROSS 
HIS BODY AND 
BRAD WILKERSON 
HAVING A TOUGH 
TIME CATCHING 
UP.
MATT: FOULED IS 
BACK AND IT'S 
3-2.
SAME STARTS ON 
TOMORROW TONIGHT
FOR GAME 2 OF 
THE SERIES.
JOIN US TOMORROW
AT 5:45, WE'LL 
BE WITH YOU FOR 
GAME 2 COVERAGE,
A FANTASTIC 
PITCHING 
MATCH-UP 
TOMORROW NIGHT.
BRAD WILKERSON 
LINES INTO RIGHT
FIELD, AND IT 
BOUNDS IN THE 
CORNER, GILES 
BRINGS IT IN 
WITH A BARE 
HAND, BUT BRAD 
WILKERSON ON THE
8TH PITCH OF THE
AT-BAT, DOUBLES 
INTO THE RIGHT 
FIELD CORNER TO 
LEAD THINGS OFF 
IN THE 6TH.
THIS IS EXACTLY 
HOW THE BOTTOM 
OF THE 5TH 
INNING STARTED 
FOR THE RANGERS.
MARK: YEAH, 
THAT'S THE FIRST
HIT GIVEN UP TO 
A LEFTY THIS 
YEAR BY BRIAN 
SIKORSKI.
SO THETHE EX-EXPOE,
FORMER NATIONAL 
LEAGUE PLAYER IS
ABOARD.
SAN DIEGO SCORED
TWICE IN THE 5TH
TO TAKE THE 
LEAD.
AND THEN IN THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
INNING, THE 
RANGERS OPENED 
WITH A DOUBLE 
AND
RACK AND RACKED 
3 TO CLAIM THE 
LEAD.
AND BRIAN 
SIKORSKI HERE IN
THE 6TH.
MARK: I 
MENTIONED A 
HIGH, 
FASTBALL-HITTING
TEAM AND IAN 
KINSLER WAS ALL 
OVER THAT ONE, 
AND HE LIKES 
THAT PITCH UP.
MATT: REMEMBER 
WHEN YOU AND I 
WERE ON THE 
FIELD BEFORE THE
GAME THIS 
AFTERNOON, 2:30,
3:00 WE WERE 
DOWN THERE FOR 
RANGER B.P., AND
YOU MADE THE 
COMMENT, "MAN, 
IS THIS A BIG 
BALLPARK."
AND IT IS BIG.
IT LOOKS BIG, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
FA
FASAD, AND IT 
PLAYS LIKE A 
BAND BOX.
MARK: UH-HUH.
MATT: BRIAN 
SIKORSKI 2 BALLS
AND A STRIKE TO 
KINSLER, AND 
BRIAN HAVING TO 
WORK DEEP IN THE
COUNT AGAIN.
FULL TO 
WILKERSON BEFORE
HE HIT THE 
DOUBLE.
AND QUICKLY 
ADKINS IS UP IN 
THE BULLPEN.
HE LOSES HIM ON 
BALL 4.
SO KINSLER IS 
ABOARD.
WE'LL SEE HOW 
LONG THE LEASH 
IS FOR BRIAN, 
HERE.
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND, 
NOBODY OUT. 
MARK: THE RUNNER
AT SECOND BASE 
AND NOW A FORCE 
AT ANY BASE, 
BARD MAY BE 
GOING OVER THE 
SCOUTING REPORT 
WITH VINNY, 
MAYBE A BUNT 
PLAY, WHO KNOWS?
MATT: THAT'S 
GOING TO BE IT.
BARD WAS BUYING 
TIME, 
APPARENTLY, FOR 
JOHN ADKINS.
LEAD-OFF DOUBLE 
AND A BASE ON 
BALLS AND 
QUICKLY THE 
PADRES GO BACK 
TO THE BULLPEN, 
A PITCHING 
CHANGE FOR SAN 
DIEGO.
IT WILL BE UP TO
ADD KINS TO WORK
DEEP AND TRY TO 
STRAND A COUPLE 
OF RERZ WITH 
NOBODY OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT 
BACK.
MATT: AFTER A 
SHORT RELEASE BY
BRIAN SIKORSKI, 
THE PADRES TURN 
TO RIGHT HANDER 
JOHN ADKINS HERE
IN THE BOTTOM 
HALF OF THE 
INNING AND 
IRONICALLY IT 
WAS ADKINS THAT 
HAD THE SHORT 
STINT, IT CAME 
IN ANAHEIM AND 
HE WAS GIVEN THE
QUICK HOOK, AND 
IT'S ADKINS 
TRYING TO 
CLEANUP AFTER A 
QUICK HOOK HERE.
MARK: IT'S GOING
TO BE A TOUGH 
JOB HERE.
YOU HAVE TO TRY 
TO TURN THE 
PAGE, LIKE A 
CLOSER WHO MAYBE
BLOWS A SAVE, 
LIKE TREVOR 
HOFFMAN, YOU GO 
OUT THERE AND 
ERASE T. THAT'S 
ONE OF THE 
QUALITIES THAT 
MAKES A SET-UP 
GUY, A MIDDLE 
RELIEVER. 
FORGET ABOUT THE
LAST OUTING, AND
COME BACK AND DO
WELL HERE.
MATT: THE 
RANGERS HAVE HIT
INTO TWO DOUBLE 
PLAYS.
BUNTING HERE 
THERE WILL BE NO
DOUBLE PLAY AND 
THE SACRIFICE 
WORKS.
GOOD EXECUTION 
BY ROD BARAJAS 
ON SOMETHING OF 
A NO-BRAINER 
CALL FROM THE 
DUGOUT, AND 
THERE ARE 
RUNNERS AT 
SECOND AND THIRD
WITH 1 MAN OUT. 
MARK: SO THE 
5TH, 5TH 
SACRIFICE HIT 
THIS YEAR FOR 
ROD BARAJAS, AND
HE DOES A NICE 
JOB BRINGING 
THOSE WRERS 
AROUND.
MATT: GARY 
MATTHEWS, JUNIOR
WITH A BASE ON 
BALLS TONIGHT.
HE STARTED PLAY 
WITH 30 
EXTRA-BASE HITS.
AGAIN, HE'S BEEN
QUIET TONIGHT.
ADKINS STARTS 
HIM WITH A 
FASTBALL FOR A 
STRIKE.
LET ME ASK YOU 
THIS, FORMER BIG
LEAGUE HURLER: 
OF ALL THE 
PITCHES THAT 
ADKINS THROWS, 
AND AS 1, A GOOD
2-SEAM AND 
4-SEAM 
FASTBALL -- 
FIRST THE PITCH 
HOME TO GARY 
MATTHEWS THAT 
MISSES.
DOES THE 
SITUATION HERE 
DICTATE HOW HE 
USES THE 
FASTBALLS?
MARK: I THINK 
FIRST OF ALL, 
ADKINS HAS TWO 
GOOD QUALITY 
FASTBALLS IN THE
4-SEAMER AND THE
2-SEAMER, AND IF
I LOOK AT THOSE 
EARL ON I WOULD 
SAY GROUNDER, 
BUT THE INFIELD 
IS PLAYING BACK.
GO FOR THE 
4-SEAMER IF YOU 
WANT THE 
PUNCH-OUT. I 
SEE WHERE YOU'RE
GOING, THOUGH, 
YOU CAN USE 
THOSE TO YOUR 
ADVANTAGE, YES, 
EARL ON IF YOU 
WANT A GROUND 
BALL YOU USE THE
TWO-SEAMER.
YOU GET THE 
QUICK OUT AND 
YOU CAN THROW 
THE 4-SEAMER.
MATT: PERHAPS 
NOT IDEAL TO GO 
OVER THE 
DIFFERENCES BUT 
IF THERE IS A 
RUNNER AT FIRST 
OR SECOND YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR THAT
GROUND BALL AND 
THE DOUBLE PLAY.
NICK THE GROUND 
BALL SCORES THE 
RUN.
IAN KINSLER 
ADVANCED TO 
THIRD.
AND NOW IT'S 
YOUNG.
MARK: WITH THE 
WAY THE THINGS 
ARE GOING AND 
THE RUNS THE 
PADRES HAVE 
SCORED, BOCH 
LIKES TO PLAY 
THE INFIELD BACK
BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO GET THE 
OUT.
MATT: IS THIS A 
SWING OF A GUY 
THAT'S WORRIED 
ABOUT HIS OPS?
MARK: [CHUCKLES]
HANGING BREAKING
BALL, I WANT TO 
SEE A GUY TAKE A
HACK LIKE THAT.
MATT: YOUNG 
FLIES TO RIGHT.
GOOD WORK BY 
JOHN ADKINS AS 
THE RANGERS 
SCORE 1.
WE HAVE A 1-RUN 
BALL GAME.
MATT: IT'S KIDS 
DAY WHAT THE 
PADRES TAKE ON 
THE MARINERS.
KIDS 14 AND 
YOUNGER RECEIVE 
THE GIVE AWAY 
ITEM OF THE 
YEAR, MUDCAT, A 
PADRES MR. 
MR. POTATO HEAD,
CALL 
877-PADRES-TIX, 
OR PADRES.COM.
MARK: YOU BET, 
CHILDHOOD MEMORY
THERE, BUDDY.
MATT: BRYAN 
COREY HERE FOR 
THE RANGERS.
MARK: BRYAN 
COREY TRYING TO 
IRON SOME THINGS
OUT.
I MENTIONED 
PITCHERS TURNING
THE PAGE AND 
FORGETTING ABOUT
IT, AND FROM THE
PADRES' POINT OF
VIEW, HERE IS A 
GUY WHO HAS BEEN
KNOCKED AROUND 
LATELY.
MATT: BRYAN 
COREY HAS 
CERTAINLY HAD AN
UNUSUAL ROUTE TO
GET BACK TO THE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
LEVEL.
GILES WILL LEAD 
OFF AGAINST HIM 
HERE IN THE 7TH.
THIS YEAR ALONE 
COREY HAS 
PITCHED AT 3 
LEVELS, 
INCLUDING MAJOR 
LEAGUE 
ARLINGTON.
TIME AT 
DOUBLE-AFRIDOUBLE-A 
FRISCO AND IN 
OKLAHOMA.
HE MADE HIS 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
DEBUT HERE 
IN 1998.
GILES FOULS THAT
OFF, GLER-2.
COREY NOT AS 
EXPERIENCED AS 
SCOTT FELDMAN, 
WHO WORKED LAST 
INNING, BUT 
STILL A GUY WHO 
HASN'T BEEN UP 
HERE IN QUITE 
SOME TIME AND 
HERE IS WHERE 
YOU FIND THE 
GREEN NATURE OF 
THE BULLPEN, A 
LOT OF YOUNG 
GUYS.
THAT'S GROANED 
OUT TO YOUNG, 1 
AWAY.
SO NOW MIKE 
PIAZZA, HE HAS 
COME THROUGH 
TONIGHT WITH A 
COUPLE OF RUNS 
BATTED IN 
EXAMINE THAT 
MERITS THE 
QUESTION, HOW 
HAS THE NATIONAL
FAIRED WITH THE 
D.H. IN PLAY, 
AND THE ANSWER 
IS, PRETTY 
EVENLY, A.L. 
BENEFITS FROM 
THE D.H. ALL 
YEAR LONG, OF 
COURSE.
AND IT LOOKS
PRETTY 
COMPARABLE.
MARK: EXCEPT FOR
THE SLUGGING 
PERCENTAGE, 
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MATT: MAY BE OF 
INTEREST FOR 
FANS TO KNOW 
THAT BEFORE THE 
GAME TONIGHT, 
COMING INTO THE 
START, MIKE 
PIAZZA'S -- 
RATHER THE D.H.,
THE PADRES' D.H.
POSITION, 
AVERAGING .208, 
NOT A WHOLE LOT 
OF PRODUCTIVITY,
THAT'S THE 5TH 
BEST IN THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
IN INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY.
THAT'S JUST A 
GUY GETTING HOT.
THAT'S ONE GUY.
YOU KNOW, PIAZZA
HAS BEEN THE 
D.H. FOR THE 
MOST PART IN 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY
FOR SAN DIEGO.
HE WAS 2 FOR 12 
IN ANAHEIM.
3 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE TO MIKE.
MARK: THIS IS 
WHERE IT GETS 
DANGEROUS.
ANY HITTER IN 
THIS BALLPARK, 
3-1, YOU LOOK 
FOR THE 
FASTBALL, TRY TO
ADD ONTO THAT 
6-5 LEAD.
OH, BREAKING 
BALL.
MATT: MISSED 
WITH IT.
AND PIAZZA IS 
ABOARD.
SEE IF MIKE IS 
ALLOWED TO STAY 
OUT THERE OR IF 
THEY WILL PUT A 
PINCH-RUNNER ON.
THE WAY RUNS ARE
SCORED IN THIS 
BALLPARK, I 
WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IN 
BOCH IS 
THINKING, I'M 
GOING TO LET 
MIKE RUN HERE 
AND GET A 5TH 
AT-BAT OUT OF 
HIM.
MARK: YEAH, HE 
DIDN'T RUN THE 
BASES THE FIRST 
TWO TIMES UP.
HE GROUNDED OUT 
AND LINED OUT.
MATT: ALL THE 
MANAGERS AT HOME
ARE THINKING 
WHAT THEY WOULD 
DO IN THIS SPOT,
THAT'S GOOD 
FODDER FOR THE 
WATER COOLER.
MARK: I WOULD 
LEAVE HIM IN 
THERE, 
ABSOLUTELY.
SO WOULD YOU, 
RIGHT?
MATT: YEAH.
THEN THIS IS THE
THING.
WHEN YOU 
CRITICIZE AND 
WHEN -- HERE IS 
GONZALEZ LINING 
IT TO LEFT, BASE
HIT, RUNNERS AT 
FIRST AND SECOND
NOW WITH ONE 
GONE.
WHEN YOU MAKE AN
ARGUMENT AS A 
FAN, AS A 
WRITER, AS A 
BROADCASTER, AS 
A TALK SHOW 
HOST, AS THEY SO
OFTEN LIKE TO 
DO, YOU MAKE A 
CRITICISM AND 
YOU HAVE TO 
THINK ABOUT THE 
WHOLE SITUATION.
IF THE 
MANAGER -- IF 
BUCK SHOWALTER 
DECIDES TO BUNT 
OR NOT BUNT, 
PINCH-HIT OR NOT
PINCH-HIT, DO 
YOU THINK HE'S 
MORE FAMILIAR 
WITH WHAT HE HAS
THAN THE NEXT 
GUY?
DO YOU THINK HE 
KNOWS MORE THAN 
WHAT WE KNOW?
THE ANSWER IS, 
OF COURSE.
NOW WITH RUNNERS
AT FIRST AND 
SECOND, BOCH 
WILL GO AHEAD 
AND REMOVE 
PIAZZA FOR A 
PINCH-RUNNER, 
AND MARK 
BELLHORN WILL 
RUN.
SO BARD THE 
BATTER WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND, 1 
AWAY.
GETS THE BULLPEN
HOT FOR THE 
RANGERS, AGAIN.
TEXAS HAS 
ANOTHER RIGHT 
HANDER DOWN 
THERE THROWING, 
FIRST FELDMAN, 
NOW COREY.
RICK BAUER UP IN
THE BULLPEN.
BY THE WAY, DO 
YOU THINK 
WHEN -- JOSH IS 
WORKING ON A 
LITTLE INGROWN 
BEARD HERE.
YOU THINK WHEN 
JOSH CEASE RICK 
BAUER UP IN THE 
BULLPEN HE GETS 
THE SHAKES, 
THINKING OF 
HANK?
JOSH, THE RADIO 
VOICE OF THE SAN
DIEGO CHARGERS, 
AND TV VOICE OF 
THE TEXAS 
RANGERS DURING 
THE SUMMER.
MARK: BARD IS 
HURTING DOWN 
THERE.
IT'S BEEN A 
WHILE.
LET'S TAKE A 
LOOK.
WHAT'S THE 
PITCH?
FASTBALL.
OH, WAS THAT OFF
HIS BACK ANKLE?
YOU DON'T SEE 
THAT TOO MUCH, 
DO YOU?
THE BACK ANKLE.
MATT: NO.
AT FIRST I 
THOUGHT HE 
FOULED THE PITCH
INTO HIS FRONT 
FOOT, BUT YOU'RE
RIGHT, IT WAS 
THE BACK ANKLE 
THAT TOOK THE 
BRUNT OF THAT 
SWING.
AND THEY'RE 
GIVING JOSH ALL 
THE TIME HE 
NEEDS TO GET THE
WHEEL RIGHT.
SO NOTHING AND 1
IT IS TO JOSH 
BARD WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND.
BELLHORN AT 
SECOND, GONZALEZ
AT FIRST.
BIG SWING AND A 
MISS.
HE WANTED TO 
TEST THAT WHEEL 
IMMEDIATELY.
GREENE NEXT AS 
COREY TAKES TIME
BETWEEN PITCHES 
NOW.
1-RUN BALL GAME,
TOP OF THE 7TH, 
6-5 SAN DIEGO.
GOT 'EM.
IT MERITS 
WATCHING BARD 
WALK BACK TO THE
DUGOUT.
MARK: HE IS 
WALKING SLOWLY 
BACK TO THAT 
DUGOUT.
MATT: SO NOW 
KHALIL GREENE 
WITH 2 GONE.
STILL 2 RUNNERS 
ABOARD, GREENIE 
SINGLED AND 
SCORED IN THE 
6TH.
POPPED HIM UP.
OUT FROM SECOND 
BASE IS IAN 
KINSLER, HE 
YIELDS TO GARY 
MATTHEWS AND THE
2 BASE RUNNERS 
ARE LEFT 
STRANDED.
MATT: COME OUT 
TO PETCO PARK 
EARLY FOR 
SATURDAY'S GAME,
IT'S FEAST STA 
COL LOS PADRES, 
TICKETS START AT
$5, VISIT 
PADRES.COM OR 
CALL 
877-FRIAR-TIX.
PITCHING CHANGE 
FOR CHANGE FOR 
SAN DIEGO, 
EMBREE GETS THE 
7TH.
MARK: HE STRUCK 
OUT 2 ANGLES IN 
ANAHEIM, IN 
ORANGE COUNTY.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: EMBREE 
FACES MARK 
TEIXEIRA, HANK 
BLALOCK AND MARK
DeROSA, HERE.
SO MARK TEIXEIRA
TURNED AROUND 
FROM THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE 
PLATE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
HAS BEEN EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY THIS
YEAR FROM BOTH 
SIDES OF THE 
PLATE.
THOUGH THE 
OVERALL NUMBERS 
ARE DOWN, HE HAS
BEEN EVEN 
BETWEEN THE 
RIGHT AND LEFT 
SIDE.
3 HOME RUNS FROM
EACH SIDE OF THE
PLATE, FAR MORE 
AT-BATS AS A 
LEFT-HANDED 
HITTER THIS 
YEAR.
1 RUN LEAD FOR 
SAN DIEGO, A BIG
SWING AND A 
MISS.
MARK: A LOT OF 
TIMES I LOOK AT 
HITTERS WHEN 
THEY'RE STANDING
IN THE BOX, AND 
IT LOOKS LIKE 
PERFECT CENTER 
FIELD ANGLE THAT
MARK TEIXEIRA 
WITH A SLIGHTLY 
OPEN STANCE IS 
SLIGHTLY OFF THE
PLATE, SO THAT 
TELLS ME THESE 
GUYS LIKE TO 
DIVE TO COVER 
THE OUTSIDE PART
OF THE PLATE.
REMEMBER A GUY 
BY THE NAME OF 
TIM WALLACH AND 
WOULD DIVE FOR 
THE BALL.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS AND 
STRIKEOUT 
RECORDED FOR EM 
COMBREE AS HIS 
FIRST PIECE OF 
BUSINESS 
TONIGHT, AND NOW
HANK BLALOCK.
I LIKE THAT 
MOVE, BRINGING 
EMBREE IN FOR 
THE 7TH, BECAUSE
YOU TURNAROUND 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
AND BAT HIM FROM
THE SIDE OF THE 
PLATE WHERE HE 
HAS BEEN 
TRADITIONALLY 
LESS LIKELY TO 
BEAT YOU WITH 
THE LONG BALL.
NOW LEFTY/LEFTY 
MATCH-UP FOR 
HANK BLALOCK, 
WHO TAKES A 
STRIKE.
6 RUNS ON 10 
HITS FOR SAN 
DIEGO, 5 RUNS ON
10 HITS FOR THE 
HOME STANDING 
RANGERS TONIGHT.
0-2.
BLALOCK STARTED 
OUT 2 FOR 2 WITH
AN R.B.I. 
AGAINST THE 
STARTER, MIKE 
THOMPSON.
BY THE WAY, IT 
IS THOMPSON WHO 
IS THE PITCHER 
OF RECORD 
TONIGHT.
MIKE HOPING FOR 
HIS FIRST WIN 
SINCE HIS SECOND
START OF THE 
YEAR.
MARK: THAT'S WHY
I WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE THE PADRES 
ADD ON A LITTLE 
BIT AND GET SOME
BREATHING ROOM 
AS YOU GO INTO 
THE 7TH, 8TH AND
9TH INNING, KEEP
THAT "W" IN 
FRONT OF 
THOMPSON'S NAME.
MATT: IF YOU'RE 
TUNING US IN 
LATE, A WIN 
TONIGHT FOR SAN 
DIEGO WOULD BE 
BRUCE BOCHY'S 
900TH CAREER.
1-2 NOW.
IF EVER THERE 
WAS A GUY THAT 
DIDN'T GET ALL 
CAUGHT UP IN 
STATS AND 
NUMBERS, IT'S 
BOCH.
BUT I THINK 900 
IS SOMETHING 
THAT EVEN HE'S 
GOING TO HAVE TO
FEEL PRETTY GOOD
B. 
MARK: OH, YEAH.
THINK OF HOW 
MANY GAMES THAT 
IS, MY GOODNESS.
>> OUT OF THE 
STRETCH, THE 
1-2.
2 BALLS AND 2 
STRIKES.
EVEN WHEN THINGS
WERE LEAN, IN 
THE IMMEDIATE 
POST- 1998 
GLORY, AND THE 
PADRES 
STRUGGLED, 
'9090, 2000, 
2002, 2003, 
THOSE WEREN'T 
PARTICULARLY 
GOOD TEAMS. 
LET'S CALL IT 
FOR WHAT IT WAS.
AND A LOT OF 
CREDIT IS THE TO
BE GIVEN TO A 
MANAGER THAT'S 
ABLE TO COACH 
VICTORIES OUT OF
TEAMS LIKE 
THOSE.
THE MANAGER OF 
THE YEAR AWARD, 
SEEMS LIKE, YOU 
CAN WRITE IT IN 
TO THE MANAGER 
WHO FINISHES THE
SEASON WITH THE 
BEST RECORD.
MARK: I THINK 
THAT'S -- 
MATT: OR WHO HAS
THE BIG PAYROLL 
AND THERE ARE A 
LOT OF MANAGERS 
WHO WILL TELL 
YOU THEIR BEST 
MANAGING JOB 
WASN'T WHEN THEY
WON THE DIVISION
IT WAS WHEN THEY
HAD TO COME OUT 
WITH A MORE 
DIFFICULT TEAM 
AND WIN.
MARK: I THINK 
THERE ARE TEAMS 
THAT COULD 
FINISHED SECOND 
AND THIRD PLACE 
THAT COULD BE 
MERITED MANAGER 
OF THE YEAR.
MATT: I AGREE.
CAR DEALERSHIP 
OF THE YEAR GOES
TO MOSSY NISSAN,
SIX LOCATIONS IN
SAN DIEGO 
COUNTY, 
INCLUDING POWAY,
OCEANSIDE, AND 
IF YOU GO BY 
NATIONAL CITY, 
TELL TIM HOWELL 
HELLO, TELL HIM 
THAT CHANNEL 4 
SENT YOU.
MOSSY KNEE KAUN.
NISSAN.


MATT: THE NEPHEW
OF -- MARK 
DeROSA HAS 
SINGLED TWICE 
TONIGHT AND 
GROUNDED INTO A 
FIELDER'S CHOICE
PLAY.
IF YOU CAN KEEP 
THINGS CLEAN 
FROM HERE ON 
OUT, THIS IS THE
LAST TIME THE 
PADRES ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH THE MARK 
TEIXEIRA AND THE
BLALOCKS OF THE 
WORLD.
2 BALLS, NO 
STRIKES TO MARK 
DeROSA.
MARK: YOU LOOK 
AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE ORDER FOR 
TEXAS, BRAD 
WILKERSON, IAN 
KINSLER, AND ROD
BARAJAS, EACH OF
THEM EXTRA BASES
TONIGHT AND 
THEY'VE EACH 
SCORED.
MATT: 3 BALLS, 
NO STRIKES TO 
MARK DeROSA.
KEVIN MENCH 
WAITING ON DECK 
FOR THE RANGERS.
MILLWOOD AND 
YOUNG JOIN US 
TOMORROW NIGHT 
FOR THAT 
PITCHING 
MATCH-UP.
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
RETURN TO 
ARLINGTON.
3 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE TO MARK 
DeROSA.
2 OUT, BASES 
EMPTY, SAN DIEGO
UP A RUN HERE IN
THE 7TH.
CLOSE GAMES 
LATE, ALWAYS A 
POSSIBILITY 
WE'LL SEE PART 
OF THE 
COMPENSATION FOR
CHRIS YOUNG, A 
POPULAR FRIAR 
FOR 2 YEARS, 
MORANDINI 
AKI.
MARK: AND 
HOPEFULLY WE 
WON'T HEAR 
"HELLS BELLS" 
TONIGHT.
THEY PLAY THE 
SAME THING FOR 
HIM AS HE COMES 
IN AS WE DO FOR 
TREVOR.
MATT: THAT WILL 
BE ALL FOR EM 
COMBREE, THE 
PODS ARE GOING 
TO GO TO SCOTT 
LINEBRINK WITH 
THAT TYING RUN 
ON BASE LATE.
THE 4TH RELIEVER
ON HIS WAY INTO 
THE CONTEST FOR 
SAN DIEGO.
PITCHING CHANGE,
A FRESH BULLPEN 
BEING USED 
DEEPLY TONIGHT.
BE BACK.
MATT: AFTER THE 
2-OUT BASE HIT, 
THE PADRES GO TO
THE BULLPEN ONCE
MORE AND IT WILL
BE SCOTT 
LINEBRINK TO 
LOOK FOR THE 
FINAL OUT HERE 
IN THE LAST OF 
THE 7TH.
INCH THE OTHER 
THING THE 
RANGERS ARE 
GOING TO HAVE TO
DO IS TURN UP 
THE DIAL, AFTER 
FACING MIKE 
THOMPSON WHO 
STARTED FOR THE 
PADRES.
SCOTTY WITH A 
GOOD FASTBALL, 
94, 95 
MILE-PER-HOUR.
MATT: MENCH IS 
HITLESS, 0-3 
TONIGHT.
TYING RUN ON 
BASE HERE IN THE
BOTTOM OF THE 
7TH.
FASTBALL BACK.
FIRST PITCH AT 
94 MILE-PER-HOUR
FROM LINEBRINK.
SCOTTY LAST 
WORKED GAME 2 OF
THE SERIES AT 
ANAHEIM.
ACTUALLY IT WAS 
A SUNDAY GAME 
WHEN SCOTT GOT 
HIS MOST RECENT 
WORK.
HE PITCHED AN 
INNING AND 
1/3RD, NOT 
ALLOWING A HIT, 
NOR DID HE WALK 
A HITTER.
AS WE TALKED 
ABOUT A LITTLE 
OVER THE 
WEEKEND, SCOTT 
IS ONE OF THOSE 
GUYS THAT 
THRIVES IN THE 
HEAT.
HE LOVES T. 
LOVES PITCHING 
IN IT, LOVES 
FISHING IN IT, 
LOVES PLAYING 
HIS GUITAR IN 
IT.
CHECKS IN ON 
MARK DeROSA.
MARK: JUST MAKES
YOU FEEL LOOSE, 
LIKE YOU'RE 
GETTING SOME 
WORK IN.
A LOT OF 
TIMES -- 
ESPECIALLY IN 
JOAQUIN ARIAS, 
SPRING TRAINING,
YOU WORKUP A 
LATH THEY ARE, 
YOU SIT DOWN IN 
THE DUGOUT AND 
YOU DRY UP, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
DRY HEAT.
HERE THE 
HUMIDITY, YOU 
GET HOT, YOU 
STAY HOT.
MATT: MARK 
DeROSA RUNS AND 
MENCH FOULS IT 
AWAY TO FALL 
BEHIND, 1-2.
YOU FIND IT 
INTERESTING -- I
CERTAINLY DO -- 
THAT NOWHERE IN 
THE BALLPARK 
HAVE THEY 
DISPLAYED A 
SCORE OF THE 
MAVERICKS GAME.
MARK: I FIND 
THAT ODD, YES.
MATT: WHEN ONE 
OF THE TEAMS IN 
THE MARKET GOES 
DEEP INTO THE 
POST SEASON, YOU
FEEL THE LOVE, 
RIGHT?
YOU SHOULDN'T 
FEEL THE 
COMPETITION.
NOT ONCE AND 
THAT GAME IS AT 
HALF TIME.
NOT ONCE HAVE 
THEY PUT THE 
SCORE UP.
MENCH POPS IT 
UP, SUCH A 
MENCH.
MARK: SWEET MAN.
MATT: NOTHING 
AGAINST A 
COMBINATION OF 
RELIEVERS IN THE
7TH.
WE MOVE ON TO 
THE 8TH.
MARK: THAT'S 
SWEET MAN.
MATT: 6 TO 5 SAN
DIEGO AS WE GO 
TO THE TOP HALF 
OF INNING NO. 8 
AND ANOTHER 
PITCHING CHANGE.
WHO SAID THEY 
DIDN'T CHANGE 
PITCHERS IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
RICK BAUER WILL 
WORK THE 8TH.
AND HE GETS 
JOHNSON, 
CASTILLA
CASTILLA.
MARK: THE PADRES
CAPITALIZED ON 
THE PITCHING 
CHANGES, AND 
SCORED A FEW 
RUNS.
COUPLE OF RUNS 
OFF FELDMAN.
THEY HAD HIS 
EYES GOING 
EVERYWHERE AFTER
THAT INNING.
MARK: AFTER 
LOOKING AT THAT 
PLAY, I THINK 
YOUNG HAD TIME 
TO GET IN FRONT 
OF THIS BALL.
IT WASN'T HIT 
ALL THAT HARD.
YOU CAN SEE HIM 
CHOPPING STEP, 
YOU KNOW WHAT I 
MEAN?
THAT GAVE HIM 
TIME TO GET THE 
BALL.
MATT: TRYING TO 
MAKE THE OMAR 
VIZQUEL PLAY.
NOW BEN JOHNSON,
WHO DOUBLED AT 
THE START OF A 
3-RUN INNING 
LAST TIME HE WAS
AT-BAT.
LOOKS LIKE 
THEY'RE GOING TO
CREDIT VINNY 
WITH A HIT ON 
THAT BALL.
SO AN 
INNING-OPENING 
SINGLE FORECAST.
FOR CASTILLA.
WE MENTIONED 
BOUR HAS 
CONSIDERABLE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
EXPERIENCE WITH 
BALTIMORE, AND 
HE SEEMINGLY 
RODE THAT BIG 
LEAGUE BALTIMORE
TO TRIPLE-A 
ROCHESTER OR 
OTTAWA TRAIN FOR
THE PAST 5 
YEARS.
5 YEARS WITH THE
OTTAWA 
AFFILIATE.
MARK: THAT'S 
TOUGH.
IT'S NOT EASY.
MATTY, DO YOU 
KNOW WHAT I'M 
SAYING?
MATT: STILL 
BEATS WORKING 
FOR A LIVING, 
THOUGH.
MARK: IT DOES, 
DON'T GET ME 
WRONG.
IT'S AMAZING 
WHAT THE MIND 
AND BODY CAN DO 
TO STILL GET TO 
YOUR DREAM.
THIS IS THE 
BUSINESS WE 
CHOOSE.
>> THIS IS THE 
LIFE WE HAVE 
CHOSEN.
>>> IS THAT THE 
WORDS?
MATT: YOU NEED A
NAP.
MARK: I SLEPT 
UNTIL 2 TODAY.
MATT: [CHUCKLES]
REALLY?
MARK: I DON'T 
NEED NO NAP.
I DON'T NEED A 
NAP, RATHER.
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND A STRIKE TO 
JOHNSON.
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK, MUDCAT, 
YOU PUT 
SOMETHING ON 
HERE, SEND 
VINNY?
YOU CAN SAY 
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
MARK: NO, I 
THINK YOU CAN, 
BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T WANT TO GO
3-1.
I THINK YOU 
MIGHT THROW HIM 
A STRIKE AND I 
THINK BUCK 
SHOWALTER AND 
THE RANGERS ARE 
THINKING, HEY, 
WE HAVE TROUBLE 
OVER ON FIRST 
BASE.
BECAUSE IF YOU 
GO TO 3-1 WITH 
JOHNSON THEN YOU
HAVE TO THROW 
HIM A STRIKE TO 
TRY TO KEEP THEM
FROM GOING FIRST
AND SECOND.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS, GOOD 
THING VINNY 
WASN'T GOING 
ANYWHERE.
HERE IS A PRETTY
GOOD EX-BIG 
LEAGUER LOOK 
ALIKE, FLIP HIM 
AROUND, TAKE 30 
YEARS OFF THE 
CALENDAR.
MARK: CAN I 
GUESS?
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: MARK 
FIDRICH.
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: GOOD CALL.
MATT: OUT OF 
STRETCH, 
CONSERVATIVE 
LEAD AND JOHNSON
LINES INTO LEFT.
MARK: HOW ABOUT 
THE NO. 8 AND 9 
GUYS IN THE 
PADRE LINE UP, 
CASTILLA AND 
JOHN SOVENLT 5 
HITS BETWEEN 
BOTH OF THEM.
MATT:
GOT SOMETHING 
MIDDLE IN, 
THROWS THE HEAD,
NICELY DONE 
MATT: AGGRESSIVE
AT THE PLATE, 
BENNY HAS DONE A
FINE JOB TONIGHT
IN HIS FIRST 
START BACK AT 
THE MAJOR LEAGUE
LEVEL AFTER 
BEING SUMMONED 
UP FROM TRIPLE-A
PORTLAND, AND 
NOW MIKE CAMERON
WHO HAS WALKED 
AND HIT A HOME 
RUN TONIGHT.
CAMERON BUNTING.
STARTER VICENTE 
PADILLA WENT 5 
AND 1/3RD 
TONIGHT, AND 
IT'S BEEN THE 
COMBINATION OF 
FELDMAN, COREY 
AND BAUER SINCE 
THEN.
YOU KNOW, YOU 
HEAR IT 
DISCUSSED WHEN 
PEOPLE BREAKDOWN
AN NFL ROSTER 
WHERE A TEAM 
SPENDS ITS 
MONEY, DO YOU 
SPEND IT FROM 
THE OUTSIDE IN 
WITH THE SKILLED
POSITION GUYS 
AND PIECE 
TOGETHER A LINE 
OR DO YOU DO IT 
THE OTHER WAY.
CAMERON BUNTING.
IS THAT CAUGHT?
IT IS AND 
ROBERTS IS 
DOUBLED UP.
WHAT A PLAY BY 
MARK TEIXEIRA.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MARK: MIKE 
CAMERON GETS 
UNDERNEATH THIS 
BASEBALL, AND 
MARK TEIXEIRA 
CHARGING MAKES 
THE CATCH, AND 
YOU CAN SEE IN 
THE BACKGROUND 
THAT BEN JOHNSON
WAS ANTICIPATING
THAT BALL BEING 
DOWN AND HE DOES
NOT GET BACK IN 
TIME, SO CREDIT,
ALSO, KINSLER 
BACKING UP ON 
THAT BLA FOR THE
FORCE PLAY AND 
THE DOUBLE-UP.
MATT: SO 2 GONE,
A RUNNER AT 
SECOND BASE AND 
MARK CONNOR 
COMES OUT TO 
VISIT WITH HIS 
RELIEVER.
I WANT TO GET 
BACK TO THE 
PAYROLL THING IN
A MOMENT, BUT 
THIS IS WHERE 
WHEN YOU PLAY 
MANAGER AT HOME,
WHEN YOU PLAY 
MANAGER IN THE 
STANDS, AND YOU 
GET ON A GUY FOR
NOT BUNTING, HOW
COME YOU'RE NOT 
BUNTING HERE?
CERTAIN GUYS 
DON'T BUNT VERY 
WELL.
MARK: SOME GUYS 
ARE PAID TO HIT,
SOME GUYS ARE 
PAID TO BUNT.
MATT: SO YOU 
DON'T ALWAYS PUT
THE BUNT PLAY ON
IN SITUATIONS 
100% OF THE TIME
AND THAT TIME 
BOCH PLAYED THE 
BUNT, AND HIS 
PLAYER DIDN'T 
EXECUTE.
MARK: EXACTLY.
MATT: SO NOW 
GEOFF BLUM 
TRYING TO COME 
OUT WITH A 2-OUT
KNOCK TO BRING 
THE RUN IN.
MARK: HE PLAYED 
IN THE BEST 
INTEREST OF HIS 
TEAM TO GET THE 
RUNNERS OVER.
THE PLAYER 
DIDN'T EXECUTE.
MATT: 2 BALLS, 
NO STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO BLUM.
MARK: AND MIKE 
CAMERON WOULD 
TELL YOU "I BLEW
IT.
I DIDN'T GET THE
JOB DONE."
MATT: GREAT PLAY
BY MARK TEIXEIRA
AGAIN.
OH MY GOODNESS, 
DUDE HERE SAVED 
A FEW RUNS.
NOT 1 BUT 2 
FANTASTIC 
EFFORTS BY MARK 
TEIXEIRA IN THE 
FIELD.
NOTHING IN THE 
PADRE 8TH.
MATT: BE SURE 
TOP TUNE INTO 
SAN DIEGO 
INSIDER TOMORROW
NIGHT.
IMMEDIATELY 
AFTER THE PADRES
GAME TOMORROW 
NIGHT.
THE BATTLE LINES
ARE BEING DRAWN 
IN THE FIGHT OF 
WHERE TO PUT SAN
DIEGO'S AIRPORT,
AND SOME SAY 
MIRAMAR IS THE 
ANSWER, AND SOME
SAY NO WAY.
WILL JOINT USE 
WORK?
SOME SAY IT 
WILL.
AFTER LIVE 
COVERAGE OF THE 
PADRES.
MARK: WHY DO YOU
THINK IT SHOULD 
GO?
MATT: I DON'T 
KNOW A THING 
ABOUT THE ISSUE 
AND I'M NOT 
ABOUT TO OPINE.
WHERE DO YOU 
THINK?
RAMONA, 
SOMEPLACE CLOSE 
TO THE HOUSE, 
ALPINE?
HERE IS BRAD 
WILKERSON 
LEADING THINGS 
OFF IN THE HOME 
8TH.
LINEBRINK SEWED 
UP THE FINAL OUT
IN THE 7TH, 
GETTING THE 
FINAL BASE 
RUNNER.
HIS LAST OUTING 
WAS GOOD FOR AN 
INNING AND A 
THIRD.
HE HAS BRAD 
WILKERSON OUT IN
FRONT.
MARK: THAT LAST 
HIT BY MARK 
DeROSA IS THE 
DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN NOT 
FACING A GUY 
LIKE HANK 
BLALOCK AND MARK
TEIXEIRA, AND IF
IT'S A PERFECT 
INNING, YOU HAVE
1, 2, 3 AND MARK
TEIXEIRA WOULD 
BE THIRD.
MATT: MARK 
TEIXEIRA WITH A 
COUPLE OF 
FANTASTIC PLAYS 
IN THAT TOP OF 
THE 8TH TO KEEP 
THE PADRES OFF 
THE BOARD.
I DON'T THINK 
THE RANGERS HAVE
BEEN WITHOUT AN 
IMPACT FIRST 
BASEMAN SINCE 
THEY MOVED INTO 
THIS BALLPARK 
SOME 12 YEARS 
AGO.
PALMERO FOR SO 
MANY YEARS, LEE 
STEVENS 
REJUVENATED HIS 
CAREER HERE, AS 
A RANGER, HAD A 
COUPLE OF GOOD 
YEARS, AND MORE 
RECENTLY, A 
NUMBER OF 
TALENTED FIRST 
BASE MEN, AS 
BRAD WILKERSON 
SWINGS AND 
MISSES.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
TO FORMER RANGER
PROPERTY TRAVIS 
HAFNER, THEY 
HAVE 
MANUFACTURED 
SOME GOOD CORNER
INFIELDERS, 
HERE.
MARK: LOOK AT 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
HE COULD PASS 
FOR THE LITTLE 
BROTHER OF MARK 
CUBAN, OWNER OF 
THE DALLAS MAVS.
MATT: I'M SURE 
HE'LL BE 
THRILLED TO HEAR
THAT.
IAN KINSLER WITH
1 GONE.
LOOKS LIKE A BAT
BOY.
THAT'S TO BLUM.
GET THE OUT.
FOR A GUY THAT'S
ACCOMPLISHED AS 
MUCH AS MARK 
TEIXEIRA HAS 
ACCOMPLISHED IN 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
BASEBALL, HE'S 
ONLY 25, 26.
IF YOU PUT A NO.
99 ON HIS BACK 
AND GAVE HIM 
RUBBER CLEATS, 
HE WOULD LOOK 
LIKE A BAT BOY.
WHAT A GREAT 
FUTURE.
2 GONE NOW FOR 
ROD BARAJAS.
SWING AND A FLY 
BALL INTO CENTER
FIELD.
LINEBRINK GETS 
THEM IN ORDER IN
THE 8TH.
WE HEAD TO 
INNING NO. 9 
WITH SAN DIEGO 
ON TOP 6-5.
MATT: LOG ONTO 
PADRES.COM AND 
CASTILLA YOUR

2006 ALL-STAR

ANOTHER PITCHING
CHANGE FOR THE 
RANGERS.
THEY'RE ON 35TH 
OF THE EVENING.
LEFT HANDER RON 
MAHAY TAKES OVER
IN THE 9TH.
MARK: THE LAST 
15 APPEARANCES 
FOR THE LEFT 
HANDER, HE'S 
ONLY GIVEN UP 3 
RUNS.
WE TALKED ABOUT 
HITTING NUMBERS,
AND RON IS 
HOLDING LEFTIES 
TO A .175 
AVERAGE.
AND WHAT DO YOU 
KNOW, BUCK 
SHOWALTER KNOWS 
THAT GILES IS 
LEADING OFF, 
HE'S GOING TO 
LOOK AT 
PERCENTAGES, 
HERE.
MATT: RON MAHAY 
IS IN HIS 4TH 
YEAR HERE WITH 
THE RANGERS.
HE HAS BEEN ONE 
OF BUCK 
SHOWALTER'S 
FAVORITE GUYS TO
USE IN THIS 
BALLPARK.
HIS CAREER 
E.R.A. HERE MANY
ARLINGTON COMING
INTO THE YEAR, 
2.90. THAT IS 
THE SECOND 
LOWEST AMONG 
QUALIFIED 
RANGERS OF ALL 
TIME.
AND HE GETS 
GILES TO GROUND 
OUT TO OPEN THE 
9TH.
RON MAHAY GOT A 
LOT OF ATTENTION
NERL HIS CAREER 
WHEN HE BROKE IN
WITH THE RED SOX
IN 1997 AS HE 
HAD PLAYED HIS 
ENTIRE MINOR 
LEAGUE CAREER 
PREVIOUSLY AS A 
POSITION PLAYER.
THE RED SOX, 
RATHER LATE IN 
HIS BASEBALL 
LIFE PUT HIM ON 
THE MOUND.
HE'S HAD NOTHING
BUT SUCCESS 
SINCE.
34-YEAR OLD 
SOUTHPAW HAS 
BEEN AT THE BIG 
LEAGUE LEVEL IN 
ONE UNIFORM OR 
ANOTHER SINCE 
THAT '97 
CAMPAIGN.
TIME WITH THE 
MARLINS, A'S, 
CUBS, TWO QUICK 
OUTS FOR RON 
MAHAY HERE IN 
THE 9TH.
MARK: MAY HAY MAHAY HAS 
A BREAKING BALL,
AND IF YOU ARE A
POSITION PLAYER 
EXAMINE THINGS 
AREN'T GOING 
YOUR WAY, WHY 
NOT GET UP ON 
THE HILL, GIVE 
IT A CHANCE.
MATT: TREVOR 
HOFFMAN UP IN 
THE SAN DIEGO 
BULLPEN.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
WITH A BOUNCING 
BALL TO KINSLER 
WHO HAD HIM 
DEFENDED 
PERFECTLY AND 
IT'S A VERY 
QUICK 1, 2, 3.
TREVOR UP NEXT.
MATT: LAST OF 
THE 9TH, SAN 
DIEGO UP A RUN 
AND THEY TURN TO
CLOSER TREVOR 
HOFFMAN TO TRY 
TO SHUT THIS ONE
DOWN ON THE 
ROAD.
TREVOR LOOKING 
FOR SAVE 17 
TONIGHT AS IT 
APPEARS MORE AND
MORE LIKELY WITH
EACH SAVE 
OPPORTUNITY THAT
HE IS HEADED TO 
THE ALL-STAR 
GAME FOR THE 5TH
TIME IN HIS 
CAREER.
HE WILL FACE THE
RANGERS HERE, 
TOP OF THE 
OSHGSD AND 
BETWEEN GARY 
MATTHEWS, YOUNG 
AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA, THERE 
IS A COMBINED 
ONE AT-BAT, AND 
THAT'S GARY 
MATTHEWS, WHO IS
0 FOR 1 AGAINST 
HOFFMAN, AND WE 
KNOW THAT THOSE 
SITUATIONS 
USUALLY FAVOR 
THE PADRES, 
ESPECIALLY WITH 
TREVOR'S 
CHANGE-UP.
BOWEN REPLACING 
BARD BEHIND THE 
PLATE.
MARK: LAST TIME 
OUT FOR TWEFR 
TREVOR
-- TREVOR WAS 
THAT TIME IN 
ANAHEIM LAST 
FRIDAY, WHERE HE
PUNCHEDED OUT 
THE BATTERS.
MATT: TREVOR 
STARTS HIM WITH 
A FASTBALL, 
HIGH.
1-1.
THE RANGERS HAVE
STRUGGLED IN 
1-RUN GAMES THIS
YEAR, 8 WINS, 12
LOSSES, SAN 
DIEGO 12-9 IN 
ONE-RUN AFFAIRS.
TEXAS HAD SO 
MANY TROUBLE 
EARL CLOSING OUT
BALL GAMES.
SOME FAILED 
CLOSERS 
EXPERIMENTS, AKI
SETTLED IN 
NICELY TO DO A 
GOOD JOB IN THE 
BACK OF THEIR 
BULLPEN.
REMEMBER, HE DID
NOT START THE 
YEAR AS THEIR 
CLOSER.
THIS IS WHERE 
SAN DIEGO HAS 
HAD THE KIND OF 
CONSISTENCY THAT
WE MIGHT TAKE 
FOR GRANTED IN 
OTHER MAJOR 
LEAGUE CITIES.
2-2.
TREVOR IN HIS 
CAREER HAS 
PITCHED HERE IN 
THIS BALLPARK 
TWICE.
HE SAVED ONE OF 
THOSE TWO GAMES,
BUT IN 2 AND 
1/3RD INNINGS 
WORKED TOTAL 
HERE, HAS GIVEN 
UP 3 EARNED 
RUNS, SO LIMITED
EXPERIENCE, BUT 
YOU COULDN'T 
CALL THIS ONE OF
HIS FAVORITE 
VENUES.
A GREAT PLAY BY 
BLUM, THE THROW 
IS IN TIME TO 
GET HIM!
WE WILL LOOK 
BACK ON THAT 
PLAY AND KNOW 
HOW BIG IT IS!
MAN!
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT, MATTY?
FROM MY VANTAGE 
POINT I THINK 
THE PADRES 
CAUGHT A BREAK.
FROM THE LEFT 
SIDE, GARY 
MATTHEWS CAN RUN
A LITTLE BIT.
HE GETS 
SOMETHING UP, HE
TOPS IT, AND NOW
THE RACE IS ON.
BLUM HAS TO 
FIELD IT ON THE 
RUN, THROW, 
VERY, VERY 
CLOSE.
MATT: I'LL TELL 
YOU WHO MADE 
THAT HAPPEN, A 
GREAT EFFORT BY 
BLUM, NO 
QUESTION, BUT 
ADRIAN GOT OUT 
THERE AS FAR AS 
HE COULD STARTED
TO MOVE THE 
GLOVE EARL 
ENOUGH TO HELP 
SELL THE CALL.
AND THERE IS 1 
HUGE OUT TO 
START THE LAST 
OF THE 9TH.
NOW MICHAEL 
YOUNG.
YOUNG SINGLED 
AND SCORED IN 
THE 5TH.
AGAIN, THESE TWO
HITTERS, 
SPEAKING OF 
YOUNG AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA ON 
DECK, HAVE NEVER
FACED TREVOR 
HOFFMAN.
1-1.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
HAS MADE HIS 
PRESENCE FELT 
TONIGHT 2 FOR 4 
WITH AN R.B.I. 
AND FANTASTIC 
DEFENSE.
MARK: I 
MENTIONED LATE 
IN THE BALL GAME
THAT THE PITCHER
WILL TRY TO KEEP
THE BALL A 
WACHLT BELIEVE 
IT.
WITH THESE 
HITTERS, THE 
RANGERS, YOU CAN
KEEP IT AWAY BUT
YOU BETTER KEEP 
IT DOWN.
THEY CAN GO OUT 
AND INTO SOME 
FIELD ON YOU IF 
YOU DON'T.
MATT: 1-2.
A BOUNCING BALL 
UP THE MIDDLE, 
THAT ONE IS 
GOING TO GET 
BUY.
TYING RUN 
ABOARD, THE 
WINNING RUN 
STEPS TO THE 
PLATE.
WELL NOW WITHOUT
QUESTION YOU'RE 
INTO THE 
SCARIEST PART OF
THE RANGERS LINE
UP.
YOUNG HAS 
SINGLED, AND NOW
YOU GOT MARK 
TEIXEIRA, AND 
SAVE A DOUBLE 
PLAY, YOU'RE 
GOING TO HAVE TO
DEAL WITH 
BLALOCK AS WELL.
MARK: MENTIONED 
HIGH, FASTBALL 
HITTERS, LOVE TO
SWING THE BAT.
HOW DO YOU TAKE 
THE STING OUT?
THE BIG KEY FOR 
TREVOR IS 
GETTING AHEAD 
0-1 WITH A 
FASTBALL AND 
THEN YOU CAN 
PLAY GAMES WITH 
THEM WITH A 
CHANGE-UP.
MATT: WELL THE 
GOOD NEWS ON 
TEIXEIRA'S LINE 
IS IS THAT HE 
HAS GROUNDED 
INTO 10 DOUBLE 
PLAYS, AND ONLY 
YOUNG HAS 
GROUNDED INTO 
MORE.
2-0 NOW.
EACH ROSTER IS 
UP ON THE TOP 
STEP IN THIS 
ONE, A ONE-RUN 
BALL GAME, END 
OF THE 9TH.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
A WORLD SERIES 
GAME, DOESN'T 
IT?
MATT: THROWING 
CABBAGE AROUND 
THE DUGOUT.
IF THAT'S 
FAIR -- IT'S A 
FOUL BALL.
AN EMPHATIC CALL
BY FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE MARK 
TEIXEIRA RAISE 
HIS WARMS IN THE
BOX?
MATT: I DIDN'T 
SEE THAT ONE 
BEING THAT 
CLOSE.
HERE COMES BUCK 
SHOWALTER.
MARK: NOT FROM 
MY VANTAGE 
POINT, NO.
MATT:

MATT: THAT'S -- 
MARK: IT'S TOUGH
TO TELL, BECAUSE
OF WHERE THE 
BALL LANDS.
NOW, A 
STRAIGHT-ON 
SHOT, HE SAYS 
DEFINITELY IT'S 
GONE.
MATT: BUCK 
SHOWALTER STILL 
OUT THERE 
SHOUTING WITH 
BILL WELKIE.
MARK: THEY GOING
TO ASK FOR HELP?
MATT: NO.
HOW DOES THE 
THIRD BASE 
UMPIRE HELP THE 
FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE ON THAT 
BALL?
I MEAN THE HOME 
PLATE UMPIRE, 
MAYBE, BUT HE'S 
CALLING THIRD 
BASE UMPIRE 
MARTY FOSTER AND
THE WHOLE CREW 
IS GOING TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ONE.
IF THEY CHAVENG 
THE CALL YOU'RE 
GOING TO HAVE A 
VISITING TEAM 
ERUPT.
FOUL BALL.
MARK: THE ONLY 
WAY YOU'RE GOING
TO TELL IF 
THAT'S FAIR OR 
FOUL IS IF YOU 
HAVE A CAMERA 
DIRECTLY IN LINE
BEHIND HOME 
PLATE DOWN THE 
FIRST BASELINE.
MATT: BOY, HE 
HIT THE SNOT OUT
OF THAT BALL, 
DIDN'T HE?
MARK: YEAH, DE.
MATT: LORD!
ALL RIGHT.
2 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE.
AFTER A 600 FOOT
FOUL BALL FROM 
MARK TEIXEIRA.
2-2.
MARK: GOING 
BACK, HE SOLD 
THAT ONE, DIDN'T
HE?
HE WAS GOING 
DOWN THE FIRST 
BASELINE PUMPING
HIS FISTS.
MATT: I THINK 
THAT WAS 
SINCERE.
MARK: I THINK IT
WAS, TOO.
MATT: POPPED HIM
UP.
MATT: WELL, 
MARK, THEY SAY 
IT'S A GAME OF 
ISSUES.
MARK: THE ONLY 
OTHER WAY TO 
TELL IS IF THAT 
FOUL POLE IS 
EXTENDED 
ANOTHER, WHAT, 
20 FEET IN THE 
AIR?
THAT FOUL POLE 
IS UP THERE, 
MATTY.
HOW TALL IS 
THAT?
50, 60 FEET, 80 
FEET, 90 FEET?
MATT: IT'S TALL.
HANK BLALOCK 
NOW.
MODERN DAY 
MURDERERS' ROW, 
AND TREVOR 
TRYING TO HOLD 
IT TO A 9TH 
INNING SINGLE TO
TOLD TO A SAVE, 
HERE.
1-1.
THERE ARE
OPPORTUNITIES 
AND THERE ARE 
SAVE 
OPPORTUNITIES.
MARK: AGAINST A 
TEAM LIKE THIS, 
YEAH.
MATT: THIS ONE 
SHOULD BE WORTH 
10 OR 15 ROLAIDS
RELIEF POINTS.
[CHUCKLES] 1-2.
HOFFMAN TRYING 
TO SAVE IT FOR 
MIKE THOMPSON.
POPPED INTO FOUL
TERRITORY, VINNY
GIVING CHASE, 
BOWEN SLIDES AND
HANK BLALOCK 
WILL HAVE 
ANOTHER CHANCE.
TREVOR 1 STRIKE

STRIKE AWAY FROM
HIS THIRD WIN 
AND BRUCE BOCHY 
IS 1 STRIKE AWAY
FROM CAREER 
VICTORY NO. 900.
INTO CENTER 
FIELD, PLAYABLE 
FOR CAMERON.
AND THAT WILL DO
IT.

THE FIRST IN THE
SERIES IN 
ARLINGTON, A 6-5
VICTORY OVER THE
HEAVY-HITTING 
RANGERS.
THE WIN FOR 
THOMPSON, THE 
SAVE FOR

MIKE'S SECOND 
HOME RUN OF THE 
ROAD TRIP.
MIKE CAMERON'S 
LONG BALL, ONE 
OF 2 FOR SAN 
DIEGO TONIGHT AS
EX-RANGER ADRIAN
GONZALEZ ALSO 
MERITS 
CONSIDERATION.
A GOOD OVERALL EFFORT BY THE 
PADRES TONIGHT.
IT'S TURNING INTO A FINE ROAD 
TRIP THROUGH THE AMERICAN LEAGUE
WEST AS SAN DIEGO WINS IT, 6-5 
PADRES.
MUD AND I RETURN AFTER THIS.

RANGERS.
SAN DIEGO GOT IT BACK AS AN 
EX-RANGER STRUCK, ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ THE FIRST TO GO INTO 
DOUBLE DIGITS, HIS 10TH OF THE 
YEAR.
TOP OF THE 5TH, SAN DIEGO GOT 2 
ON A PIAZZA SINGLE, FRIARS LEAD 
3-1, BUT THE RANGERS WOULD GET 
THE LEAD BACK IN THE BOTTOM.
THE LEAD FLIP-FLOPPED TONIGHT ON
3 OCCASIONS.
TIES AT 3 BY ROD BARAJAS, 
JOHNSON DROVE IN GREENE TO TIE 
IT IN THE 6TH, AND THEN THE 
2-RUN HOME RUN BY MIKE CAMERON

ALL-STARS WITH POSTSEASON
EXPERIENCE, ARE NOW, ADDING
SPEED AND SIZZLE TO THE
SAN DIEGO PADRES OUTFIELD
AND LINEUP.
BOTH HAVE ALSO REBOUNDED
FROM SERIOUS INJURIES.
NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY GOT
LUCKY, BUT BECAUSE THEIR
POSITIVE ENERGY HAS HELPED
FUEL THEIR FIRE, TO GET,
BACK IN THE GAME.

THE PLAYER AND DO SOME OF
THE THINGS HE WAS DOING ON
TV.
>> WHO WERE SOME OF THE
PLAYERS YOU TRIED TO
EMULATE?
>> MORE SO, WILLIE RANDOLPH.
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE.
I LIKE THE WAY WILLIE
CARRIED HIMSELF.
>> PLAYING BASEBALL FIRST
WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
WITH NO LITTLE LEAGUE FOR
HIM TWO BROTHERS AND SISTER.
>> GROWING UP I THOUGHT I
WAS IN A RICH NEIGHBORHOOD.
I GOT EVERYTHING I WANTED.
WHICH WASN'T A LOT BUT WE GO
THE, CLOTHES HAD A ROOF.
WE HAD FOOD, THAT'S THE WAY
YOU SUPPOSED TO LIVE.
BUT WE WERE THE LOW INCOME
NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND AS WE CALL IT THE
GHETTO.
>> ONCE JOINED ORGANIZED
SPORTS AT TEN HE WOULD BE
CONSISTENT MVP OF TEAMS AND
TOURNAMENTS FROM.
A WORKING CLASS FAMILY, HIS
PARENTS OFTEN TOLD HIM --
>> THERE IS SOMEONE OUT
THERE ALWAYS BETTER THAN
YOU.
I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE
BETTER THAN ME.
>> A TEACHER ENCOURAGED HIM
TO SWITCH TO A PRIVATE
CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
>> SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I
STAY ON RIGHT TRACK.
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK
BEING IN THE GHETTO, OR
GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD
HAVE DETERRED ME AT ALL.
I JUST HAD A MISSION ON MY
MIND.
AT THAT PARTICULAR STAGE OF
MY LIFE AND, I WASN'T GOING
TO LET ANYTHING OR ANYONE
GET IN BETWEEN US.
>> WHAT WAS YOUR MISSION?
>> WAS GOING TO BE
SUCCESSFUL.
I WAS GIVEN A GOD-GIVEN
TALENT.
I WAS GOING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT.

THAT OFF-SEASON.
>> BUT FOR HIS SON?
>> OH, YEAH.
>> SENIOR YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLFRIEND.
PAT ERIC, JR..
>> I WANT EVERYBODY TO
UNDERSTAND APPRECIATE TOOK A
REAL MAN TO STEP UP AT AGE
18 AND RAISE A SON TO
FINALLY, HAVE HIM FOLLOW IN
YOUR FOOTSTEPS IS PROBABLY
DREAM COME TRUE FOR HIM.
A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE
RAN FROM THAT SITUATION.
YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE AND
LOVE FOR HIM DOING THAT FOR
ME.
NOT LEAVING ME AND STILL,
CONTINUING HIS DREAM AS, HE
HAS GONE THROUGH BASEBALL
BEING THERE FOR ME AS I GREW
UP.
>> NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET
ME EMOTIONAL TALKING ABOUT
MY SON.
OKAY.
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO
YOU, TO HEAR HIM RECOGNIZE
HOW IMPORTANT, THAT IS TO
HIM?
HE SAYS SOME THINGS ON
CAMERA AND IN INTERVIEWS
SURPRISE ME SOMETIMES.
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALLY
SAY IT TO ME.
BUT, HE'S A SPECIAL KID.
HE'S A SPECIAL KID.
>> WHAT WAS THAT IN YOU THAT
MADE YOU WANT TO BE
COMMITTED?
>> I JUST REMEMBER MY DAD
SAYING TO ME, YOU KNOW WHAT?
OKAY, IT'S HAPPENED.
YOU JUST GOT TO BECOME A MAN
FASTER THAN YOU WANTED TO.
I WILL BE THERE EVERY DAY TO
HELP YOU THROUGH.
WHEN HE SAID THAT TO ME,
THAT TALK, THAT FATHER-SON
TALK I KNEW EVERYTHING WAS
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE
IT ALL RIGHT.
>> SO AT RUTGERS HE PLAYED
FOOTBALL, REQUIRED BY HIS
SCHOLARSHIP AND BASEBALL,
BECAUSE HE LOVED IT.
>> MY FIRST AT-BAT I HIT A
HOMERUN.
THEN CAME UP THE NEXT TIME.
I HIT ANOTHER HOME RUN.
I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE
THAT WAS MY CALLING.
>> AS A STANDOUT BASEBALL
SCOUTS SHOWED INTEREST.
>> THEY HELD OFF BECAUSE THE
FACT I WAS GOING BACK FOR MY
SENIOR YEAR IN FOOTBALL THAT
I WAS MORE COMMITTED TO
FOOTBALL THAT I WANTED TO
PLAY FOOTBALL.
ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK
ME, TAKE ME AWAY FROM THIS.
>> HE WOULD GRADUATE FROM
RUTGERS IN FOUR YEARS WITH
HIS NAME IN THE FOOTBALL AND
BASEBALL RECORD BOOKS.
A BUSINESS MANAGEMENT DEGREE.
AND AS THE LOS ANGELES
DODGERS DRAFT PICK IN THE
43rd ROUND.
DETERMINED HE WAS BETTER
THAN THAT HE WORKED SEVEN
DAYS A WEEK AT ROOKIE BALL
IN FLORIDA.
>> SUNDAY WAS OFF DAY BUT IT
WASN'T AN OFF DAY FOR ME.
BECAUSE, ME AND COACHES
WOULD GET OUT THERE AND TAKE
THOUSANDS OF GROUND BALLS.
I JUST REMEMBER THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S HOT.
SWEATING.
TIRED.
I DIDN'T NEVER THINK ABOUT
THAT.
I KEPT THINKING I GOT TO GET

INTO THE PLAYOFFS IN 1995.
AND THEN 1996, BACK AT
SECOND BASE.
>> THAT WAS MY BEST YEAR.
WHEN EVERYTHING CAME
TOGETHER.
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
>> A BASE STEALING MACHINE,
A NATIONAL LEAGUE HIGH OF
53.
AND BEING THE SECOND MODERN
DAY PLAYER TO HAVE A 6-STEAL
GAME, ALL WORTH THINKING
BEING NAMED AN ALL-STAR.
>> WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID,
INTRODUCE, TIPPING HAT AND
WEARING THEIR NICE SHOES AND
EVERYTHING.
SO I ENJOYED THAT AND
TURNING DOUBLE PLAY WHICH
WAS HIS LAST ALL-STAR GAME.
>> WITH A TRADE BACK TO THE
DODGERS IN '98, HE WAS THE
TOUGHEST BATTER TO STRIKE
OUT IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE
IN '99.
KNOWING HIS GOAL, WAS JUST
TO GET ON BASE.
>> USE THESE LEGS.
THAT WAS MY JOB.
>> HE ACT SELLED AT THAT
WITH THE CHICAGO CUBS.
THE MILWAUKEE BREWERS, BY
2003 WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO
GIANTS.
REUNITED WITH HIS OFF-SEASON
WORKOUT FRIEND, BARRY BONDS.
>> HE'S AN INSPIRATION TO
ALL THE OTHER GUYS.
I TRY TO TELL HIM BEFORE
WE'RE WORKING OUT, SAID YOU
KNOW, YOU STAND NEXT TO ME.
WE'RE IN LINEUP PEOPLE WILL
THINK I'M THE BETTER ATHLETE
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
AND YOU CAN GIVE A LOT TO A
LOT OF PEOPLE.
SHOW SIZE DOESN'T MATTER.
>> WITH AGE COMES AT
JUSTMENTS.
SIGNING WITH TEXAS IN 2004
AS UTILITY PLAYER.
>> CALLED SUPER UTILITY.

INJURY AND ILLNESS SUDDENLY
MEANT HE WAS STARTING
CENTERFIELDER OPENING DAY.
>> IT WAS FUNNY.
I REMEMBER, 3-2, JASON BAY.
BOOM.
THAT'S ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT,
GOING TO GET IT.
I GOT IT.
I PAID FOR IT.
>> WE HOPE THAT SHOULDER IS
OKAY.
>> RATHER THAN SURGERY AND
BEING OUT FOR A YEAR, TOO
LONG AT THIS STAGE IN HIS
CAREER, HE TOOK HIS CHANCES
WITH INTENSE REHAB.
RETURNING SOONER THAN
EXPECTED.
>> REACTIVATED TO, PLAY
TONIGHT.
ERIC YOUNG.
>> YOUNG WAS A BIG PART OF
THE SECOND HALF.
AND THE PADRES, DIVISION

TIMELINE IS BASED ON THIS
GOAL.
>> I THINK IT HAS MANY YEARS
AS IT TAKES MY SON TO TAKE
TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES.
THAT'S HOW MANY YEARS I HAVE
LEFT, YES.
>> ONE WAY TO STAY IN SHAPE
FOR NOW.
A ROUTINE FAR FROM THE
BRIGHT LIGHTS AND BASE PATHS
OF THE DIAMOND.
IT'S OFF-SEASON AND
OCCASIONAL IN SEASON YOGA

IT WAS DEFINITELY, A GREAT
DECISION.

>> IF HE AND HIS SON COULD
WRITE THE END OF EY'S MAJOR
LEAGUE STORY IT WOULD START
WITH TWO OF THEM BEING ON
SAME TEAM.
>> I WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO
CALL HIM UP FOR ME, BUT GIVE
US ONE DAY IN THE BIG
LEAGUES TOGETHER.
THEN THEY CAN RELEASE ME AND
GIVE HIM THE SPOT.
>> PROBABLY BAT LEAD OFF.
HE WILL BAT SECOND.
FIRST AND SECOND WE PULL OFF
A DOUBLE STEAL.
>> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
>> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
>> BASEBALL ISN'T USUALLY
CONSIDERED A CONTACT SPORT
BUT IN THOSE RARE AND OFTEN
DRAMATIC IT MOMENTS WHEN
PASSION AND SPEED, MEET A

RESULTS ARE OFTEN
DEVASTATING.
MIKE CAMERON KNOWS THAT ALL

EVEN MORE SO NOW THAN, YOU
KNOW, THINGS THAT WENT
THROUGH, TO, PLAY THE GAME.
YOU KNOW, JUST TO PLAY.
LOT OF GUYS, HAVE SURGERIES
AND INJURIES, THEY'RE NOT
ALLOWED, JUST DON'T ALLOW
THEM TO COME BACK.
>> COMING BACK SEEMED
UNLIKELY IN NOT UNIMAGINEABLE
AFTER ONE FATEFUL DAY,
SUMMER OF 2005, PLAYING
AGAINST THE SAN DIEGO PADRES
IN PETCO PARK.
>> IT WILL SCORE BELTRAN.
>> CAMERON WAS THE RIGHT
FIELDER FOR THE NEW YORK
METS.
NOT HIS NATURAL POSITION.
HE HAD BEEN MOVED TO RIGHT
BECAUSE THE METS HAD BROUGHT
IN CARLOS BELTRAN TO PLAY
CENTER.
CAMERON HAD STEADILY BEEN
MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT BY
AUGUST 11th.
THEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE
7th --
>> BALL OVER IN RIGHT
CENTER.
THOUGHT I HAD THE BALL.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I GOT,
HIT BY A FREIGHT TRAIN.
>> OH.
WHAT A TERRIBLE COLLISION.
>> OH, BOY.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M
AT.
MY MIND WAS, PUZZLED.
I'M DAZED.
I HAVE NO IDEA BUT I DO KNOW
THAT, ONLY THING I KNOW I'M
ALIVE.
D BUT, I CAN'T MOVE.
MY BODY WON'T MOVE.
>> THIS IS BAD AS COLLISION
I'VE SEEN.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THE EXTENT
OF THE DAMAGE OR ANYTHING
ELSE LIKE THAT.
I JUST KNEW THAT, WHY DIDN'T
I CATCH THE BALL.
THEY KEPT ME PINNED DOWN ON
MY BACK LONGEST.
TRYING TO MOVE MY LEGS
KNOWING I CAN GET ON MY SIDE
TO BREATHE.
BECAUSE I CAN'T.
I'M CHOKING.
BLOOD.
AND, FINALLY, I THINK, ONCE
TRAINER REY RAMIREZ CAME OUT
THERE, TURNED ME ON MY SIDE.
THEY FOUND OUT MY NECK WAS
BROKEN OR WHATEVER.
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE.
I WANT TO GET UP.
I WANT TO GET UP AND LOOK
AROUND AND MY BODY, I WANT
TO SEE MYSELF.
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS
OKAY.
BUT THEY DON'T LET ME GET
UP.
BOTH OF MY LIPS SPLIT.
MY JAW IS UNHINGED A LITTLE
BIT.
MY FACE IS BURNING.
EXTENSIVELY.
I HAD A HEADACHE, OUT OF
THIS WORLD.
BUT I WAS CALM THOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY UNTIL I GOT
IN AMBULANCE THEY STARTED
CUTTING MY CLOTHE OFF.
THEY ONLY DO THAT WHEN THERE
IS SOMETHING SERIOUS.
I WAS REAL SERIOUSLY IN
DISTRESS INSIDE BECAUSE I
KNEW THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN
THEY TOOK ME OFF THE FIELD
THAT MAY BE MY LAST TIME
GOING BACK ON A BASEBALL
FIELD.
>> HOW HE WOULD EVENTUALLY
DEAL WITH HIS INJURIES IS
ROOTED IN HIS HISTORY.
A GUY ABLE TO ADAPT AND
BOUNCE BACK, EVEN AS A QUIET,
YET ADVENTEROUS KID.
>> JUMPING OFF BACK OF THE
HOUSE.
JUMPING, BICYCLES.
TRYING EVERYTHING.
>> BORN MICHAEL TERRANCE

HIS HOMETOWN IS, LA GRANGE,
GEORGIA WHERE HE FIRST
PLAYED BASEBALL IN HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD AT SIX.
>> I WAS KIND OF LIKE A
LITTLE GUY IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE WHOLE THING BUT I COULD
RUN.
I COULD DO EVERYTHING.
>> EVEN THOUGH HIS PARENTS
WERE IN HIS LIFE HE AND HIS
BROTHERS AND SISTERS SPENT A
LOT OF TIME AT GRANDMA
FANNIE MAE'S HOUSE AFTER HIS
GRANDFATHER DIED, SHE
ADOPTED YOUNG MIKE.
WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM HER?
>> HARD WORK.
I MEAN, JUST DEDICATION.
AND SHE WAS LIKE A, YOU KNOW,
MOST SOUND PERSON IN OUR
FAMILY.
>> TOUGHENED UP FROM PLAYING
FOOTBALL HE PREFERRED
BASEBALL WHICH MIGHT HAVE
BEEN HIS TICKET TO COLLEGE.
BUT HE COULDN'T PASS UP THE
CHICAGO WHITE SOX WHO
DRAFTED HIM OUT OF HIGH
SCHOOL IN THE 18th ROUND.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS
PRETTY DID I TO DO IT BUT
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
>> JUST FOUR YEARS LATER
MADE HIS MAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT,
EXCITING FOR HIM AND HIS
FAMILY.
>> I WAS LIVING SOME PARTS
OF THEIR DREAM.
I FINALLY MADE IT TO BE THE,
PLAYER THAT THEY THOUGHT I
COULD BE BUT I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW YET.
>> AS A TOP PROSPECT HE
STARTED NEXT SEASON IN AAA.
BUT ONCE CALLED UP AGAIN, HE
STEPPED UP.
>> WHOA BOY.
MIKE CAMERON.
>> FINISHING 6th IN THE
AMERICAN LEAGUE ROOKIE OF
THE YEAR BALLOTING.
AFTER STRUGGLING HIS
SOPHOMORE YEAR THE WHITE SOX
TRADED HIM IN NIPT NINE TO
THE CINCINNATI REDS FOR PAUL
KONERKO.
OF AFTER ESTABLISHING
CAREER-HIGHS IN EVERY
OFFENSIVE CATEGORY, HE WAS
TRADED TO SEATTLE IN 2000.
THAT WAS PRETTY HIGH-PROFILE
DEAL WITH KEN GRIFFEY, JR.,
PART OF THAT MIX.
>> GOING FOR THE GUY
PROBABLY BEST PLAYER IN THE
LEAGUE FOR LONGEST.
>> THE TEAM'S ADVICE?
>> BE YOURSELF.
DO WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF
DOING.
>> AS PART OF THE
SENSATIONAL MARINER SEASON
MIKE CAMERON PROVED HIMSELF.
>> HE DOES IT AGAIN.
>> EARNING FIRST OF TWO GOLD
BLOFS.
PICKED AS AN ALL-STAR IN,
2002 AGAINST HIS FORMER
WHITE SOCKS HIT FOUR
CONSECUTIVE HOME RUNS.
FIRST TIME THAT HAD BEEN
DONE IN THE AMERICAN LEAGUE
SINCE 1959.
>> FEEL LIKE I HAD SOMETHING
TO PROVE TO THEM ALL THE
TIME.
I DIDN'T KNOW THE REASON WHY
I WAS TRADED FROM THERE.
>> AS FREE AGENT AND SEATTLE
NOT AN OPTION CAMERON SIGNED
WITH THE NEW YORK METS.
>> I THOUGHT I WAS READY FOR
IT.
>> YOU WEREN'T?
>> WELL, YOU DON'T QUITE,
PREPARE FOR, EVERYTHING THAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN THERE.
>> WITH HIS FIRST SERIOUS
INJURY, A TORN TENDON IN HIS
HAND, AND WITH SEVERAL
PLAYERS ALREADY ON THE
DISABLED LIST --
>> I COULDN'T ALLOW MYSELF
TO GO ON THE DL I STRUGGLED
WITH THE GAME OF BASEBALL.
I WAS GETTING PLACE ERRED.
I WAS GETTING BOOED AT HOME.
IT WAS EVERYTHING.
I NEVER GOT BOOED AT HOME
BEFORE.
AND, IT WAS A GOOD
EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
IT WAS CHARACTER BUILDING
SITUATION FOR MYSELF AS A
MAN.
>> EVEN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE,
HE BROKE THE MET'S HOME RUN
RECORD FOR CENTERFIELDERS.
BECAME THE 11th PLAYER IN
METS HISTORY TO HIT 30 HOME
RUNS.
>> THOUGHT I HAD CROSSED THE
BRIDGE IN NEW YORK CITY AND
EVERYTHING.
BUT, THERE WAS MORE TO COME.
I MEAN THERE WAS MORE TO
COME.
>> WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO
AUGUST 2005, THE COLLISION
AND 6 1/2 HOUR SURGERY.
>> LOWER HALF OF MY FACE,
HAD TO BE RECONNECTED TO MY,
MY SOCKETS AND STUFF BACK
TOGETHER.
I WAS REALLY FEARING THE
FACT THAT I WAS GOING NOT BE
ABLE TO SEE.
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE,
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT?
>> YEAH A LITTLE BIT.
I WOULD SAY A LITTLE BIT.
THROUGHOUT HERE IS, IT'S ALL
LIKE PLATES.
I GUESS, IT TOOK A LONG TIME
FOR THIS STUFF TO SETTLE IN.
THESE THINGS HERE TO SETTLE
IN AND EVERYTHING.
MY EYES ARE KIND OF, GOT,
MAYBE ONE OF THEM IS NOT,
QUITE AS, LIKE THE OTHER
ONE.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF CUTS AND
SCARS.
I GOT SCREWS IN HERE.
YOU KNOW.
JUST CUT ME ON THE TOP OF MY
LIP, LIKE FACE-OFF.
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, -- IT WAS
A -- PRETTY, PRETTY GYRATING
EXPERIENCE I GUESS.
AND, I DIDN'T KNOW IF I
COULD GO BACK AND PLAY RIGHT
FIELD AGAIN.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD DO
IT.
>> WITH THE METS CENTERFIELD
SPOT TAKEN, SAN DIEGO TOOK A
CHANCE IN A TRADE FOR XAVIER.

THE THROW IS TOO LATE.
HOW ABOUT MIKE CAMERON
LIGHTING THINGS UP TONIGHT.
>> HE APPRECIATES
SAN DIEGO'S BEACHES WHERE HE
OFTEN REFLECTS ON HIS
RECOVERY AND HIS SISTER'S
UNEXPECTED DEATH FROM A
PULMONARY CONDITION.
>> REASON WHY YOU SHOULD
NEVER TAKE EACH DAY FOR
GRANTED.
>> HE MISSES HIS WIFE AND
THREE CHILDREN WHO WILL
VISIT FROM GEORGIA IN THE
SUMMER.
.
>> TELL ME ABOUT YOUR
WRITING, WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
>> IT STARTED OUT BEING A
SECRET.
I GUESS IT'S NO LONGER A
SECRET NO MORE.
HAVING SOME POSITIVE
THOUGHTS IN MY MIND I WANT
TO PUT ON PAPER.
MY SWING, SO GRACEFUL AS A
WILLOW TREE.
SO QUICK AS A COBRA STRIKE.
>> KNOWING WHAT'S POSSIBLE
NOW, THAT TYPE OF INJURY,
WHY DID YOU WANT TO COME
BACK?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I THINK I NEEDED TO COME
BACK JUST FOR THE SAKE I
ALWAYS CAME BACK THROUGH
EVERYTHING.
AND, I DON'T THINK THERE WAS
A PARTICULAR REASON WHY I
COULDN'T.
SMOOTH LIKE THE OCEAN ON A
PEACEFUL NIGHT.
YES YET SO POWERFUL AND
THUNDEROUS AS WAVE CRASHING
INTO LAND NOT ONLY FOR BUT
MY LITTLE ONE TOSS SHOW A
LITTLE BIT, THEY SAW ME GO
THROUGH EVERYTHING TOO.
THEY SAW ALL OF THOSE
DIFFERENT DAYS THAT I HAD TO
GO THROUGH AND, COULDN'T HE
SEE.
COULDN'T EAT.
LOSING A LOT OF WEIGHT.
TO GET, MY STRENGTH BACK, TO
GET BACK ON WHAT I ALWAYS
DO.
I JUST, I THINK IT WAS A
GOOD, GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR
ME TO SHOW THEM THAT, YOU GO
THROUGH CERTAIN THINGS IN
LIFE, THERE'S A LOT OF
DIFFERENT OBSTACLES IN LIFE
THAT WE GO THROUGH.
AS HUMAN BEINGS.
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO LIVE
THROUGH IT, THEN IT'S ONLY
GOING TO MAKE YOU STRONGER.
>> MY SWING, MY SWING, CAN
YOU FEEL IT?
MY SWING.
>> MIKE CAMERON AND ERIC
YOUNG HAVE CHALKED UP SOME
SOLID NUMBERS BECAUSE OF
THEIR TENACITY AND ALL-OUT
PLAY.
SERIOUS INJURIES SHOWED THEM
HOW QUICKLY THE GAME CAN BE
TAKEN AWAY.
AT THIS STAGE IN THEIR
CAREERS THINGS THAT
CERTAINLY MATTER TO THEM,
DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
AND DON'T HOLD BACK.
I'M JANE MITCHELL.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
"ONE-ON-ONE".

SAN DIEGO FOR MORE EXCITING
UNIQUE LOCAL PROGRAMING.
CHANNEL 4 SAN DIEGO, ONLY ON
CABLE TELEVISION.
NOT AVAILABLE ON SATELLITE.

JOHN: ON A NIGHT WHEN THE DALLAS
MAVS ARE CENTER STAGE, WE COME 
TO YOU FROM THE HOME OF THE 
TEXAS RANGERS, IN PREPARATION 
FOR THE FIRST OF THREE BETWEEN 
THE PADRES AND RANGERS, HERE ON 
CHANNEL 4.
WELCOME BACK.
THE NBA FINALS ON EVERYBODY'S 
MINDS TONIGHT.
WE'LL SEE HOW IT AFFECTS THE 
CROWD AT THE BASEBALL PARK.
BUT THE PADRES HAVE BEEN HERE A 
COUPLE DAYS ARRIVING IN 
ARLINGTON ON SUNDAY.
MARK: BRUCE BOCHY LIKES TO GET 
AK
ACCLIMATED TO THE CITY YOU'RE 
GOING TO BE PLAYING IN.
MATT: THIS MAY BE A MILESTONE 
NIGHT FOR BOCH.
MARK: INTO HIS 12TH YEAR AS 
SKIPPER FOR THE PADRES, 899 IS 
THE NUMBER, ALOU, AND CHANCE, 
BUT THIS TELLS YOU ONE THING.
THE CONSISTENCY OF BRUCE BOCHY, 
THERE IS A LOT OF FACTORS THAT 
GO INTO WHY HE HAS 899 WINS.
HE'S GOOD WITH THE PRESS, HE'S 
GOOD WITH THE FANS, WE'RE 
ROOTING FOR BOCH.
MATT: SOME OF THOSE TEAMS HAVE 
BEEN GOOD SINCE HIS TENURE, AND 
IT'S A CREDIT FOR HIM TO HAVE 
WON THAT MANY GAMES IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES AND HE'S DONE IT WITH 
MANY COACHES ON HIS STAFF OVER 
THE YEARS. WHEN WE COME BACK, 
MUD SITS DOWN WITH THE LATEST 
ADDITION, NEW/RETURNING HITTING 
COACH MERV SITS DOWN WITH HIM 
AFTER THIS.
MARK: WELCOME BACK TO TEXAS, AND
FOR A FEW MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO
TALK WITH THE HITTING COACH MERV
RETTENMUND.
MARV, YOU WORE THE BLUE, AND THE
OTHER COLORS, AND ARE YOU GLAD 
TO BE BACK?
>> IT'S THE ONLY PLACE I WOULD 
HAVE TAKEN THE JOB.
IEMENT MOST SHOCKED PERSON, AND 
WHEN THEY CALLED IT WAS A HECK 
OF AN OPPORTUNITY.
IF I FELT BAD ABOUT ANYTHING, IT
WAS DAVE MAGADAN LOSING HIS JOB 
AND I CONSIDER HIM A GOOD 
FRIEND.
MARK: YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS AND 
IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST 
UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS IN ALL OF 
BASEBALL.
YOU HATE GETTING RELEASED, AND 
IT'S PART OF BASEBALL.
BUT YOU DID TALK TO HIM.
>> OH, YEAH, AND I WAS ON THE 
PHONE, HE UNDERSTANDS IT, IT'S 
BASEBALL, AND HE UNDERSTANDS 
THAT I DIDN'T CALL THE BALL CLUB
TO GET HIS JOB, BUT WHEN YOU 
HAVE A FEW PLAYERS GOING BAD AND
IT'S CONTAGIOUS, IT HAPPENS TO 
EVERYONE IN BASEBALL, AND THE 
FRONT OFFICE MAKES MOVES AND THE
COACHES AND THE MANAGERS ARE THE
PEOPLE THAT SUFFER.
MARK: YOU MENTIONED MAKING 
MOVES.
YOU'RE COMING HERE TO SAN DIEGO 
AS A HITTING COACH.
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THESE GUYS,
YOU'VE SEEN THEM ON TV.
IS THERE A PERIOD WHERE YOU HAVE
TO GET TO KNOW THEIR STROKE AND 
THEIR PERSONALITY?
>> I THINK THAT'S THE BIG ONE,
RIGHT THERE.
I'LL LEARN A HITTER'S STROKE IN 
ONE DAY AND IT TAKES LONGER THAN
THAT TO GET TO KNOW THE 
INDIVIDUAL AND THE
RESPOND TO THINGS.
A LOT OF TIMES I LIKE TO SAY 
THINGS THAT ARE OFF-COLOR, AND I
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW ME 
BEFORE I START DOING THAT.
WE HAD A NICE SERIES IN ANAHEIM,
WE HAD SOME QUALITY AT-BATS UP 
THERE, WE GOT THE PITCH COUNTS 
UP.
IF I WAS DOWN ON ONE THING, A 
LOT OF TIMES AHEAD IN THE COUNT 
WE CHASED PITCHES WE SHOULDN'T 
HAVE BEEN SWINGING AT.
MARK: YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT 
YOUR PHILOSOPHY IN THE PLANE, 
BUT GIVE THE PADRE FANS, BUT YOU
HAVE THREE POINTS THAT YOU LIKE 
TO TELL THE HITTERS TO HAVE GOOD
BALL GAMES AND GET AT-BATS.
>> I LIKE TO GET READY AND NONE 
OF THIS WILL SURPRISE TONY GWYNN
IF HE'S LISTENING.
I LIKE TO SEE THE BAT CENTERED 
OVER THEIR HEAD AND WAIT 70/30, 
AND A LONG FOLLOW-THROUGH.
AND IF YOU DO THESE THINGS YOU 
KEEP YOUR EYES YOUR HONOR 
CONTROL AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
BASEBALL SAY "THE EYES HAVE IT."
AND IT'S BALL, BRINGING THE BAT 
BACK TO YOU.
ANYTIME YOU SEE ONE OF OUR 
PLAYERS SWING AND THE EYES GOING
UP YOU KNOW THE BARREL OF THE 
BAT IS GOING DOWN AND MORE THAN 
LIKELY IT'S GOING TO BE A FOUL 
BALL.
MARK: TALK ABOUT HITTING IN THIS
BALLPARK AS OPPOSED TO OTHER 
BALLPARKS.
THE BALL HAS A TENDENCY TO FLY 
HERE.
I'M GUESSING YOU TELL THEM DON'T
TRY TO LIFT, IS THERE SOMEBODY 
YOU SAY, GOT TO KNOCK THAT OFF 
WHILE WE'RE HERE.
>> MARK, HOPEFULLY EVERYONE 
KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE 
CAGE.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO DO ANYTHING
DIFFERENT, BARREL IT UP, HARD TO
THE MIDDLE.
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR APPROACH.
IT DOESN'T MATTER THE BALLPARK 
YOU'RE PLAYING IN, YOU BARREL IT
UP, YOU HIT IT HARD TO THE 
MIDDLE, AND YOU TAKE YOUR 
CHANCES.
MARK: YOU LIKE THE DH?
IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.
ARE YOU A FAN OR NOT?
>> WHEN THEY PUT IT IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE NEEDED 
SOMETHING.
THEY NEEDED SOMETHING TO LIVEN 
IT UP.
I AM NOT A FAN OF IT, I DO LIKE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE BASEBALL BETTER,
BUT WE HAVE IT AND WE'RE STUCK 
WITH IT.
MARK: HOW ABOUT INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY?
I KNOW AT FIRST IT WAS NEAT TO 
GO TO OTHER BALLPARKS, BUT ARE 
YOU A FAN?
>> I LIKE IT IN TEXAS THE FANS 
WILL GET TO SEE CERTAIN PLAYERS 
THEY WOULD NEVER GET TO SEE AND 
I THINK WE PLAY TOO MANY GAMES.
AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANYONE.
AND IF YOU DREW 18 GAMES IN 
INTERLEAGUE AND YOU'RE PLAYING 
THE YANKEES, AND THE RED SOX OR 
THE BRAVES, AND ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE COIN YOU'RE PLAYING 
THREE LESSER CLUBS YOU'VE GOT A 
CHANCE TO MAKE UP FOUR OR FIVE 
GAMES.
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR IN 
THAT REGARD.
MARK: YOU MAKE YOUR HOME IN SAN 
DIEGO, DON'T YOU?
>> I LIVE 8 BLOCKS FROM THE 
STADIUM AND AFTER THE END OF THE
ROAD TRIP I'LL WALK HOME.
I LIKE THAT A LOT.
THAT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT, 
AND THE OTHER THING IS I HAVE 
TWO GRANDKIDS THAT WILL BE ABLE 
TO COME OUT TO THE BALLPARK AND 
SEE ME.
THAT'S EXCITING.
MARK: MERV, THANKS FOR YOUR 
TIME.
GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
>> MARK, YOU WERE ONE OF THE 
OTHER REASONS.
MARK: SOUNDS GOOD.
MORE TO COME FROM ARLINGTON, 
RANGERS AND FRIARS AFTER THIS.

>> THE TEXAS RANGERS CAN FLAT 
OUT HIT.
THEY START A 3 GAME SERIES 
TONIGHT AGAINST A RANGER LINE UP
HITTING OVER 300 IN THE MONTH OF
JUNE.
TONIGHT RIGHT HANDER THOMPSON 
WILL SEE HOW THE OTHER HALF 
LIVES AND HE FACES AN AMERICAN 
LEAGUE OPPONENT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN HIS CAREER.
SAN DIEGO HOPING TO MUSCLE UP IN
THE A.L. WEST, GAME 1 OF THE 
SERIES, PADRES AND RANGERS, 
NEXT!
MATT: AMERICA WEST FIELD IN 
ARLINGTON, SITE OF THE 
INTERLEAGUE SERIES AS TONIGHT 
YOUR PADRES CONTEND WITH THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE WESTERN DIVISION
LEADING TEXAS RANGERS.
WELCOME TO ARLINGTON FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN QUITE A WHILE BACK
ALONGSIDE MARK GRANT, MATT 
VASGERSIAN, THE RANGERS ARE HOT,
THEY CLAIMED A SHARE OF FIRST 
PLACE IN THE WEST.
THEY'RE DOING IT WITH BIG 
HITTING NUMBERS.
MARK: THIS IS A BALL CLUB THAT 
IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES THEY LEAD 
IN BATTING AVERAGE, THEY'RE 
SECOND, THEY'RE SECOND IN HITS, 
.461 HITTING PERCENTAGES ARE 
OUTSTANDING.
HOW DO THEY DO IT?
THEY DO IT PRETTY MUCH ALL THE 
WAY AROUND.
THEY HAVE POP IN THE LINE UP, 1 
THROUGH 9 SHOULD BE TOUGH.
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR THIS 
PITCHING STAFF.
MATT: A PADRES PITCHING STAFF 
THAT'S BEEN OUTSTANDING ON THE 
ROAD, AN ERA OF 3.81.
MARK: EVERYBODY IN BASEBALLS 
TALKS ABOUT PLAYING IT ON THE 
ROAD, AND WITH AN ERA OF 3.81, 
THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, MATTY?
MATT: KEEP THE BALL DOWN.
IT WILL BE UP TO THOMPSON AND 
VICENTE PADILLA TO SEE IF THEY 
CAN KEEP THEIR BALLS DOWN ON THE
ROAD HERE TONIGHT.
THOMPSON IS 7TH AS A MAJOR 
LEAGUER.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU ALONG WITH US.
THE STARTING LINE UP AND OPENING
PITCH, RANGERS AND FRIARS RIGHT 
AFTER THIS.
MATT: FORMERLY THE BALLPARK IN 
ARLINGTON, AMERICAQUEST FIELD, 
IT'S BEEN THE HOME OF THE 
RANGERS SINCE 1994 AND THE 
PADRES PAYING THEIR VISIT HERE 
IN SOME YEARS, AN UNINTERRUPTED 
HISTORY SINCE THE ADVENT OF 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY.
MANAGER BUCK SHOWALTER, HARD TO 
BELIEVE HE'S BEEN HERE FOR FOUR 
YEARS, AFTER TURNING AROUND A 
YANKEE PROGRAM, LAYING THE 
BLUEPRINT FOR A DIAMONDBACKS 
CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM, AND THE 
RANGERS DO CHECK IN TODAY WITH 
FIRST PLACE IN THE A.L. WEST.
MARK: BUCK SHOWALTER USED TO GO 
OVER VIDEO, SPENDING THE NIGHT 
IN THE CLUB HOUSE TO SCOUT A 
CERTAIN BALL TEAM. WE'LL SEE 
HOW THE SCOUTING HAS GONE 
AGAINST THESE PADRES AS THEY 
START OF THE FIRST GAME OF THE 
SERIES.
MATT: LET'S LOOK AT THE LINE UP.
CAMERON WILL LEAD OFF IN THE 
ABSENCE OF DAVE ROBERTS.
THAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE MOMENT.
IT WILL BE BLUM GETTING A START 
IN THE 2 HOLE, HIGHEST HE'S HIT 
ALL YEAR, HE'S AT SECOND.
GILES, PIAZZA, AND GONZALEZ, THE
FORMER RANGER, THEY MAKE OUT 3-5
PART OF THE LINE UP, BARD, 
GREENE, CASTILLA AND JOHNSON, 
RECENTLY RECALLED OUTFIELDER.
THEY ROUND THINGS OUT FOR THE 
PADRES HERE TONIGHT.
ON THE MOUN FOR THE RANGERS, 28 
YEAR OLD VETERAN RIGHT HANDER 
VICENTE PADILLA IN HIS FIRST 
YEAR AS A RANGER.
HE IS COMING OFF A WIN FROM THE 
WHITE SOX.
MARK: IT WAS A SEASON HIGH IN 
STRIKEOUTS FOR HIM AGAINST THAT 
TEAM.
HE WILL THROW 80 TO 90% 
FASTBALLS.
THE DEFENSE WILL WORK FOR HIM, 
HE THROWS A SLIDE SXER A CHANGE 
UP.
HE HAS TO RELY 
ON MOVEMENT.
MATT: WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT VICENTE 
PADILLA'S SPLITS
THAT ARE THINGS 
THAT CERTAINLY 
CATCH YOUR 
ATTENTION, 
INCLUDING THE 
FACT THAT HE HAS
BEEN MUCH, MUCH 
BETTER AT HOME 
IN WHAT'S 
LARGELY 
CONSIDERED A 
HITTERS BALLPARK
THAN HE HAS AWAY
FROM AMERICA 
QUEST FIELD.
4 AND 2 AND THE 
ERA HERE, AND 
WE'LL SEE WHAT 
HOME COOKIN HAS 
IN STORE FOR 
FIRST-YEAR 
RANGER VICENTE 
PADILLA TONIGHT 
AND BRUCE BOCHY 
PERHAPS 9 
INNINGS AWAY 
FROM CAREER WIN 
900.
MIKE CAMERON 
LEADS THINGS OFF
FOR SAN DIEGO.
MIKE CAMERON, 
BLUM AND GILES 
AS WE ARE SET 
FOR BASEBALL 
DOWN IN TEXAS 
TONIGHT.
AS WE MENTIONED,
IT'S NOT THE 
MOST WIDELY 
ATTENDED AFFAIR 
THAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO WATCH 
OUT OF THIS 
VENUE.
MARK: I THINK 
PEOPLE ARE MORE 
CONCERNED ABOUT 
A 3-SECOND LINE 
VIOLATION THAN A
3-RUN SHOT.
MATT: UNDERWAY 
AS VICENTE 
PADILLA'S FIRST 
PITCH IS FOULED 
BACK.
MIKE CAMERON HAD
HIS FOURTH HOME 
RUN OF THE YEAR,
AND THE FORMER 
PHILLIES PITCH 
MISSES OFF THE 
PLATE, 1-1.
THEY SHARE A 
FIRST PLACE IN 
THE A.L. WEST, 
SWEEPING THE 
DIAMONDBACKS 
OVER THE 
WEEKEND.
SAN DIEGO CHECKS
IN 3 GAMES OVER 
500, ALSO WITH A
SHARE OF A 
WESTERN DIVISION
LEAD, ALONG WITH
THE DODGERS OUT 
IN FRONT OF THE 
PACK IN THE N.L.
WEST.
MARK: MATTY, I 
HAD A CHANCE TO 
TALK WITH 
MANAGER BRUCE 
BOCHY OFF THE 
GAME AND I KNOW 
THE QUESTION YOU
AND I ASKED WAS 
THE LEAD-OFF 
SPOT, TALKING 
ABOUT THE 
LEAD-OFF 
POSITION AND THE
OPTIONS THAT 
BOCH HAD.
GOING WITH 
CAMERON TONIGHT,
PROBABLY WITH 
E.Y. TOMORROW 
AGAINST 
MILLWOOD, BUT 
THE OTHER 
OPTIONS ARE 
BARFIELD AND 
BELLHORN, 
DEPENDING ON WHO
IS GOING TO BE 
PITCHING THAT 
DAY FOR THE 
OPPOSITION.
SO MIKE CAMERON 
HAS EXPERIENCE 
IN THE PAST 
BATTING 
LEAD-OFF, AND 
ALREADY HE HAS 
SEEN FOUR OR 
FIVE PITCHES AS 
BARFIELD GETS 
THE NIGHT OFF.
MATT: OFF THE 
END OF THE BAT A
FLY BALL IN 
SHORT RIGHT 
FIELD, MARK 
DeROSA COMING ON
IN THE WIND TO 
MAKE THE CATCH.
THE RANGERS 
DEFENSIVELY RANK
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE, BROUGHT 
TO YOU BY KRAGEN
AUTO PARTS, BRAD
WILKERSON, GARY 
MATTHEWS AND 
MARK DeROSA IN 
THE OUTFIELD, 
HANK BLALOCK, 
IAN KINSLER AND 
MARK TEIXEIRA IN
THE INFIELD.
MARK: THE 
OFFENSIVE 
NUMBERS FOR 
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
CONSISTENTLY UP 
THERE IN THE 
RANGER TOPS IN 
CERTAIN 
CATEGORIES, HE 
IS A GOOD ONE, 
THAT YOUNG.
MATT: NOTHING-1 
TO BLUM WHO AS I
MENTIONED, IS 
STARTING AS HIGH
IN THE ORDER AS 
HE HAS ALL YEAR 
AND THOUGH HE'S 
QUICKLY BEHIND 
0-2 TO PADILLA, 
HE HAS GREAT 
CAREER NUMBERS 
IN THIS MATCH-UP
AND THAT 
EXPLAINS WHY HE 
IS PLAYING BUT 
BATTING IN THE 
2-SPOT TONIGHT, 
ALSO.
POPPED HIM UP.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
OFF FIRST BASE 
FOR A QUICK 
SECOND OUT.
MARK: MATTY, YOU
MENTIONED THE 
WIND.
THE WIND IS 
HOWLING STRAIGHT
IN.
THE WIND IS 
WHIPPING IN 
STRAIGHT FROM 
CENTER FIELD.
MATT: SO 2 QUICK
OUTS FOR GILES, 
ALSO WITH CAREER
NUMBERS AGAINST 
VICENTE PADILLA 
AND GILES CHECKS
IN TONIGHT 
HAVING RIPPED 
THROUGH HE HAD 
EDISON FIELD IN 
ANAHEIM.
HERE IS THE 0-1.
A 7-13 ROAD TRIP
FOR GILES, THIS 
TRIP.
PADILLA HAS 
PITCHED WELL 
AGAINST THE 
PADRES IN HIS 
CAREER.
THERE'S A BASE 
HIT FOR GILES.
STAY HOT.
2 OUT SINGLE FOR
SAN DIEGO.
MARK: THE ONE 
THING I THINK 
ABOUT WHEN I SEE
PADILLA ON THAT 
HILL IS SINKER, 
SINKER, JAMMING 
GUYS, AND HE'S 
GOT A GOOD 
BREAKING BALL 
THAT HE THREW 
EARLIER THIS 
EVENING.
GILES GOT A 
STRAIGHT 
FASTBALL, BUT HE
JUMPED ALL OVER 
IT, USING THE 
CENTER OF THE 
DIAMOND NICELY.
MATT: SO THE 
2-OUT SINGLE AND
NOW MIKE PIAZZA.
ON THE FIRST 
PITCH A BOUNCING
BALL TO SECOND, 
IAN KINSLER IS 
THERE TO THROW 
HIM OUT.
NOTHING COMES OF
THE 2-OU 
SINGLE.
UNDERWAY IN 
ARLINGTON.
NO SCORE.
MATT: NOTHING IN
THE SAN DIEGO 
HALF OF THE 
FIRST AS WE GO 
TO THE BOTTOM 
HALF OF INNING 
NO. 1.
IT'S TIME FOR 
MIKE THOMPSON TO
GO TO WORK ON A 
BUCK SHOWALTER 
RANGERS LINE UP.
THIS IS BROUGHT 
TO YOU BY RICOH,
AND IT'S GARY 
MATTHEWS, YOUNG,
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
BLALOCK, MARK 
DeROSA, MENCH, 
BRAD WILKERSON, 
IAN KINSLER AND 
JOSH BARFIELD 
BARAJAS.
LOOKING FOR HIS 
FIRST WIN SINCE 
ATLANTA AT HOME.
MARK: MIKE 
THOMPSON IS NOT 
AFRAID.
ANY GOOD-HITTING
TEAM, ANY 
POOR-HITTING 
TEAM, HE IS 
GOING TO THROW 
STRIKES.
IF HE CAN GO SIX
INNINGS, THE 
BULLPEN IS WELL 
RESTED FOR SAN 
DIEGO.
BOCH WOULD BE 
HAPPY WITH 6 
INNINGS FROM 
MIKE THOMPSON.
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND NO STRIKES 
TO FORMER FRIAR,
GARY MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOO, .344, 
THIRD BEST IN 
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE.
7 HOME RUNS, 36 
RBI'S, AND LEAD 
INNING A NUMBER 
OF CATEGORIES.
MARK: SOME GUYS,
MATTY, IT TAKES 
A WHILE FOR THEM
TO MATURE AND 
REALIZE THAT 
THERE IS ONE 
THING IN YOUR 
MIND THAT 
CLICKS.
MATT: BALL 4 AND
A RARE WALK BY 
MIKE THOMPSON.
A GUY WHO'S 
CONTROL HAS BEEN
PRETTY GOOD TO 
GWYNN HIS MAJOR 
LEAGUE CAREER.
TAKE A LOOK AT 
THE DEFENSE 
BEHIND MIKE 
TONIGHT BROUGHT 
TO YOU BY 
OCEAN'S 11 
CASINO.
THE PADRES WITH 
A SHARE OF THE 
TOP-FIELDING 
PERCENTAGE IN 
THE NATIONAL 
LEAGUE AND 
NOTEWORTHY IS 
BEEN JOHNSON 
MAKING A START 
IN THE LEFT 
FIELD IN THIS 
SUNNY TIME OF 
NIGHT IN PLACE 
OF THE INJURED 
DAVE ROBERTS.
MARK: YOU CAN 
SEE HOW LONG THE
SHADOW IS ON 
BEEN JOHNSON 
THAT GOES TOWARD
THE WARNING 
TRACK.
IT TELLS YOU 
THAT THE SUN IS 
RIGHT AT EYE 
LEVEL.
MATT: MICHAEL 
YOUNG 5TH IN THE
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
IN BATTING AT 
.327 AND IF WE 
SOUND LIKE A 
BROKEN RECORD IN
THIS TELECAST 
TONIGHT, 
QUICKLY, IT'S 
BECAUSE THIS IS 
AN 
OFFENSIVE-MINDED
TEAM HERE IN 
ARLINGTON.
1-1, WE'LL SEE 
IF GARY MATTHEWS
LOOKS FOR AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO 
RUN.
MARK: MATTY, YOU
MAKE A GOOD 
POINT BECAUSE 
THIS IS A TEAM 
THAT HAS SOME 
POP.
THEY CAN HURT 
YOU WITH 
EVERYTHING.
THEY ARE 12TH ON
STOLEN BASES.
GARY MATTHEWS 
HAS 3, AND THEY 
CAN PICK THEIR 
SPOTS AND HURT 
YOU WITH A 
STOLEN BASE.
MATT: 2 BALLS, 2
STRIKES TO YOUNG
A LONG WITH THE 
5TH BEST BATTING
AVERAGE IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
IS SECOND IN 
HITS.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
WAITING NEXT AND
IT'S AN UNUSUAL 
TWIST FOR FOLKS 
DOWN HERE TO SEE
A TEAM THAT 
CLICKS ON ALL 
CYLINDERS, YET 
MARK TEIXEIRA IS
STRUGGLING THIS 
YEAR.
MARK: PERFECT 
EXAMPLE OF THE 
TEXAS RANGERS 
TEAM DOING SO 
WELL AND HAVING 
OTHER GUYS PICK 
UP GUYS LIKE 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
YOUNG, HANK 
BLALOCK, MARK 
DeROSA, MENCH, 
IF ONE GUY IS 
STRUGGLING, THE 
OTHER 8 CAN DO 
DAMAGE.
MATT: GOOD 
CONVERSATION 
BETWEEN THOMPSON
AND BARD, NOW 
THEY'RE BACK AT 
IT.
3-1 TO YOUNG.
A STRIKE, NOW A 
FULL COUNT, 3-2.
WE'LL KEEP YOU
POSTED ON THE 
INTERLEAGUE 
HAPPENINGS 
TONIGHT.
OAKLAND IS IN 
COLORADO, 
SEATTLE IS IN 
L.A., AND WE'LL 
KEEP YOU POSTED 
AS THEY GWYNN IN
OUR TELECAST.
THAT BALL COULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN 
HIT AT A BETTER 
SPOT, 2 GONE 
HERE IN THE 
FIRST.
MARK: A GOOD 
DEFENSIVE PLAY 
BY THOMPSON.
FOUND HIS 
LOCATION, 
PERFECTLY 
EXECUTED AND 
BLUM HAVING TO 
GET OUT OF THE 
WAY OF MATTHEWS 
AT SECOND BASE 
AND THE IN 
BETWEEN HOP AT 
FIRST BASE.
THERE ARE A LOT 
OF TEXAS RANGERS
FANS FAMILIAR 
WITH THE GLOVE.
MATT: ANOTHER 
PADRES DOUBLE 
PLAY AND JOCK IN
THE BOX DONATES 
$100 TO SERVE 
THE KIDS WITH 
BIG BROTHERS AND
BIG SISTERS IN 
SAN DIEGO 
COUNTY.
1-1 THE COUNT TO
MARK TEIXEIRA.
ONLY HOME RUNS
FOR MARK TECHES MARK IN GAME
61, AND THERE 
ARE LOFTY GOALS 
HE SET FOR 
HIMSELF.
THIS TIME LAST 
SEASON HE WAS 
GOING GANG 
BUSTERS, 19 HOME
RUNS, SLUGGING 
.577.
IT'S BEEN A 
DROP-OFF THIS 
YEAR.
THAT BALL IS 
LINED INTO THE 
CORNER IN RIGHT.
A DOUBLE TO GIVE
THE RANGERSRANGERS.
MARK: THE HOME 
RUNS ARE ARE 
GONE FOR THE 
TEXAS RANGERS 
THIS YEAR BUT 
THE RUNS ARE 
ABOUT THE SAME, 
SCORING RUNS, AS
WE MENTIONED IN 
THE PREGAME 
SHOW, AND WHEN A
GUY IS NOT DOING
IT AT THE PLATE,
IT TAKES A 
BREAKING BALL OR
A HANG
HANGER TO GET 
BACK IN THE 
MODE.
MATT: HANK 
BLALOCK NOT 
WASTING ANYTIME.
THE RANGERS ARE 
ON THE BOARD 1-0
TEXAS.
SO THE 
SAN MARCOS ARE 
NOT DRIVES IN A 
RUN AGAINST THE 
"HOMETOWN 
UNIFORM" TO PUT 
THE RANGERS ON 
THE BOARD FIRST 
TONIGHT.
MARK: I DON'T 
THINK THAT WAS 
BY DESIGN BUT 
THAT SWING 
THERE, YOU GOT 
TO LIKE THE 
SWING, 
AGGRESSIVE 
SWING.
MIKE THOMPSON 
TRIES TO GO 
AWAY.
HE HITS IT OFF 
THE ENOF THE BAT
TOWARDS LEFT 
FIELD.
A LITTLE DUCK 
SNORT AND THAT 
SCORES A RUN.
MATT: NOW MARK 
DeROSA AND THAT 
DOUBLE PLAY BALL
COMING BACK TO 
HAUNT BUCK 
SHOWALTER.
THIS COULD BE A 
BIGGER LEAD FOR 
THE TEXAS 
RANGERS.
MARK DeROSA 
CHECK EGG IN AT 
.333 WITH 25 
RBIS.
WE'RE GOING TO 
SEE THIS FOR THE
NEXT TWO NIGHTS 
AS WE ARE TELE 
TELEVISED 
TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW.
THIS IS NOT A 
TEAM THAT TALKS 
ABOUT TAKING 
PITCHES AND 
GETTING ON BASE 
AND WORK THE 
COUNT AS MUCH AS
THEY HACK.
IT'S GROUNDED TO
VINNY.
THROW TO SECOND 
CUTS DOWN 
BLALOCK AND THAT
WILL DO IT IN 
FIRST.
1-0 TEXAS.
MATT: RANGERS ON
TOP FIRST AND ON
THE BOARD EARLY,
1-0 TEXAS, OUR 
SCORE THROUGH AN
INNING.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ,
BARD AND GREENE 
LEAD OFF IN THE 
SECOND AGAINST 
VICENTE PADILLA.
ADRIAN LIKE A 
COUPLE OF 
TEAMMATES, 
ARRIVES HERE 
BACK IN FAMILIAR
TERRITORY, 
HAVING ENJOYED 
THE FIRST PART 
OF THIS 
INTERLEAGUE TRIP
WITH A COUPLE OF
HOME RUNS, 
AGAINST THE 
ANGLES OVER THE 
WEEKEND.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN 
IT YET, MUD CAT,
BUT I WOULD 
IMAGINE BEFORE 
WE GET OUT OF 
HERE WE WILL SEE
THE COLUMNISTS, 
THE BEAT WRITERS
TALK ABOUT 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ,
THE FORMER 
RANGER HAVING 
SUCH A FINE YEAR
IN SAN DIEGO.
MARK: I THINK 
WE'LL HEAR A LOT
ABOUT CHRIS 
YOUNG, ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ, CHAN 
HO PARK, AND 
THERE WERE A LOT
OF WRITERS, 
TRYING TO TRACK 
DOWN FORMER 
RANGERS, TRYING 
TO GET QUOTES.
ADRIAN HAS TO BE
PUMPED UP, DON'T
YOU THINK?
HE WANTS TO COME
BACK HERE TO AR 
LINK
-- ARLINGTON TO
GET SOME NOKZ 
FOR THE PADRES.
MATT: YEAH, AND 
HE'S NOT GOING 
TO GET OEFRL 
EMOTIONAL ABOUT 
MUCH.
THIS IS AN EVEN 
KEELED KID.
MARK: HE HANDLES
HIMSELF VERY 
WELL AS A BIG 
LEAGUER, NO 
DOUBT ABOUT 
THAT. HE DOES 
ALL HIS TALK
WITH YOUING HIS 
BAT.
MATT: THAT'S 
RIGHT.
2-2 TO GONZALEZ,
HIGH, DEEP DRIVE
TO RIGHT AND 
TIED!
TOP TANK!
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] THE 
10TH OF THE YEAR
FOR ADRIAN.
HE 
REFAMILIARIZES 
HIMSELF WITH 
THAT RIGHT FIELD 
THAT RIGHT FIELD
PAVILLION, AND 
HE GOT IT.
MARK: RIGHT DOWN
THE MIDDLE.
MATT: SO NOW 
JOSH BARD, A 1-1
TIE ON ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ' THIRD 
HOME RUN IN NOT 
EVEN FOUR GAMES 
ON THIS ROAD 
TRIP.
THE MONTH OF 
JUNE HAS BEEN 
VERY KIND TO 
ADRIAN.
MARK: WE TALKED 
ABOUT KEEPING 
THE BALL DOWN IN
THE ZONE, 
ESPECIALLY IF 
YOU'RE A SINKER 
BALLER.
THAT WAS 
ELEVATED ABOVE 
THE BELT BUCKLE 
AND HE SENT IT 
412 FEET INTO 
THE UPPER DECK.
MATT: JOSH BARD 
COMING OFF A 
3-HIT GAME 
SUNDAY IN 
ANAHEIM AS 
VICENTE PADILLA 
TAKES SOMETHING 
OFF FOR THE 
STRIKE THERE, 
1-2.
THERE ARE TWO 
EXRANGERS LOVING
THE TRIP BACK 
HOME AND BARD IS
CAUGHT LOOKING.
SO 1 GONE ON 
VICENTE 
PADILLA'S FIRST 
STRIKEOUT OF THE
NIGHT AND THAT 
WILL BRING IN 
KHALIL GREENE.
WE MENTIONED 
VICENTE 
PADILLA'S LAST 
START, MUDCAT, 
AND IT CAME 
AGAINST THE 
WHITE SOX HERE 
IN ARLINGTON, 
AND HE WAS 
OUTSTANDING THAT
NIGHT.
8 INNINGS OF 
SHUT-OUT 
BASEBALL, 
ALLOWED ONLY 3 
HITS, STRUCK OUT
7, BUT THAT 
START DID NOT 
COME WITHOUT ITS
SHARE OF 
CONTROVERSY, 
TWICE PADILLA 
HIT 
A.J.PRAZINSKI, 
AND THEN THERE 
WERE RETALIATION
ISSUES WHEN 
OZZIE HAD A 
ROOKIE LEFT 
HANDER WHO HE 
HAD CALLED UP 
FROM TRIPLE-A 
AND -- GREENE 
HITS A BALL OUT 
TO SXRIET A 
GREAT GRAB BY 
MARK DeROSA.
THAT BALL GOT IN
THE WIND AND 
KEPT PULLING 
AWAY FROM MARK 
DeROSA BUT HE 
MADE THE CATCH 
FOR OUT NO. 2.
MARK: I THOUGHT 
THIS BALL WAS 
OVER HIS HEAD.
GREAT JABB AND 
HE TOOK A RING 
OF THE BELL 
RIGHT ON THE 
BELL.
HE GOT HIS BELL 
RUNG A LITTLE 
BIT, TOO, IT 
LOOKS LIKE.
SAME HEIGHT.
THAT'S A BIG 
OUT.
MATT: SO 2 GONE 
NOW FOR VINNY.
CASTILLA ALSO 
SWUNG THE BAT 
WELL IN ANAHEIM 
OVER THE WEEK 
END, HE HAS 4 IN
A ROW.
MARK: GOING BACK
TO THAT A.J. 
STORY, I WONDER 
IF VICENTE 
PADILLA READ 
THAT POLE IN 
SPORTS 
ILLUSTRATED 
SOMEWHERE?
MATT: YEAH, THE 
QUESTION WAS 
AMONG PLAYERS, 
PLAYERS ASKED 
THIS, WHO WOULD 
YOU LIKE TO SEE 
BEANED, AND A.J.
WAS THE POPULAR 
CHOICE.
CASTILLA WITH A 
DRIVE INTO LEFT 
FIELD, THAT BALL
IS WELL HIT, 
BRAD WILKERSON 
ON THE MOVE, HE 
PLAYS IT OFF THE
FENCE.
VINNY INTO 
SECOND.
MARK: HOW ABOUT 
VINNY BEING TOO 
HOT FOR TV IN 
GAME 1 OF THE 
SERIES?
MATT: CASTILLA 
WITH HIS SECOND 
DOUBLE ON THE 
ROAD TRIP.
HE IS NOW 
HITTING OVER 300
ON THE ROAD THIS
YEAR.
MARK: THAT'S A 
PERFECT EXAMPLE 
OF MISSING 
LOCATION.
YOU CAN SEE THAT
BARAJAS WAS 
HITTING IT DOWN 
AND HE'S LUCKY 
THAT BALL DIDN'T
GO OUT.
VINNY SAYS 
RECENTLY HE'S 
BEEN SEEING THE 
BALL A LITTLE 
BETTER.
MATT: SO A 
RUNNER ON 
SECOND.
WHEN DAVE 
ROBERTS WAS 
PLACED ON THE 
DISABLED LIST 
SUNDAY, JOHNSON 
WAS RECALLED.
MARK: IF HE 
DROPS THAT 
ELBOW, MATTY, 
HIS FASTBALL IS 
GOING TO FLATTEN
OUT QUITE A BIT.
HE'S GOT TO 
CONCENTRATE ON 
GETTING THAT 
DOWNWARD PLANE 
ON THE SINKER.
MATT: JOHNSON 
FOULS THAT ONE 
AWAY.
BEEN BACK FOR 
THE SECOND TIME 
THIS YEAR.
AND A BOUNCING 
BALL TO THIRD 
BASE.
HANK BLALOCK 
THROWS OUT 
JOHNSON AND HIS 
RETURN TO THE 
LINE UP.
SAN DIEGO GETS 
ONE TO PULL EVEN
ON THE GONZALEZ 
HOME RUN.
BACK IN TEXAS 
AFTER THIS.
>> 1 APIECE, 
EVEN THROUGH AN 
INNING AND A 
HALF, BACK WITH 
MARK GRANT, MATT
VASGERSIAN, 
MENCH, IAN 
KINSLER LEAD 
THINGS OFF HERE 
FOR THE RANGERS.
HANK BLALOCK GOT
A SING DOUBLE 
AND IT TURNED 
INTO A RUN FOR 
THE RANGERS, AND
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
COUNTERED WITH A
HOME RUN.
YOU'RE HARD 
PRESSED TO FIND 
ANYTHING OTHER 
THAN GOOD 
NUMBERS IN THIS 
RANGER LINE UP.
WOULD HE TALKED 
ABOUT WHAT THEY 
ACCOMPLISHED 
COLLECTIVELY, 
AND ONCE THE 
CALENDAR PAGE 
TURNED TO JUNE A
GOOD OFFENSE 
SEEMED TO GET 
EVEN BETTER.
MARK: MATTY, 
THEY HAVE FOUR 
GUYS IN THE LINE
UP HITTING 300 
OR BETTER, AND 3
PLUS WITH 10 
HOME RUNS, BRAD 
WILKERSON ON 
DECK WITH 13, 
HANK BLALOCK 
WITH 10, AND 
MENCH WITH 10.
A WE 
WILL-ROUNDED 
LINE UP, MY 
FRIEND.
MATT: GOOD 
PITCH, SWUNG ON 
AND MISSED.
LOOKED LIKE MIKE
THREW HIM A 
CHANGE-UP, 
THERE.
PADRES TWAY ON 
THE GIANTS ON 
SATURDAY, JULY 
1ST IN A RARE, 
DAY/NIGHT DOUBLE
HEADER.
GAME 1 AT 12:05,
GAME 2 AT 7:05, 
BROUGHT TO YOU 
FIREWORKS BY 
SONY, 
877-FRIAR-TIXS, 
OR PADRES.COM.
BRAD WILKERSON 
IS ON THE LEADER
BOARD, ALTHOUGH 
IT'S ONE HE 
WOULD PREFER NOT
TO BE PLACED ON.
>>> HE LIKES TO 
HACK, FOR SURE.
HE'S GOING TO 
HAVE TO THROW 
THIS GUY A 
STRIKE, MATTY.
MATT: YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO THROW 
HIM ONE ON 1-0.
BRAD WILKERSON 
HAS PUNCHED OUT 
83 TIMES, IN 
FACT THAT LEADS 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
BASEBALL, 
LEADING JENKINS 
AND DUNN, FROM 
THE NATIONAL 
LEAGUE.
BOUNCED TO 
GREENE, AND THAT
WILL BE OUT NO. 
2.
MARK: HE HAS TO 
PROTECT WITH 2 
STRIKES.
HE DOESN'T WANT 
TO ADD TO THAT 
STRIKEOUT TOTAL,
AND THAT'S WHY 
HE DIDN'T PUT 
ALL THAT GOOD OF
A SWING ON IT.
IT WASN'T THAT 
GREAT OF A 
PITCH, EITHER.
MATT: SO NOW THE
ROOKIE SECOND 
BASEMAN, IAN 
KINSLER, A .319 
HITTER AT THE 
START OF PLAY 
HERE TONIGHT.
2 GONE FOR 
THOMPSON HERE IN
THE SECOND.
KIN
KINSLER WITH 
GOOD NUMBERS, 
DESPITE A 
DISLOCATED THUMB
EARLIER IN THE 
SEASON.
FIRST HOME RUN 
CAME IN THE 
SECOND GAME OF 
THE YEAR, AND 
SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER, HE 
HAD FOUR EXTRA 
BASE HITS IN THE
GAME, PUTTING 
HIMSELF ON THE 
MAP.
HE LAYS OFF THAT
PITCH.
IT'S 3-ONE.
MARK: THIS GUY 
TURNED PRO, AND 
THE SHORT TIME 
HE'S BEEN IN 
PROFESSIONAL 
BASEBALL HE'S A 
CAREER .304 
HITTER.
MATT: SENDS THAT
UP FOR MIKE 
CAMERON AND THE 
SIDE GOES DOWN 
IN ORDER IN THE 
LAST OF THE SEK.
WE'VE PLAYED 2 
COMPLETE, TIED 
AT 1.
MATT: A WUP-1 
DRAW AS WE GO TO
THE TOP HALF OF 
INNING NO. 3 
TONIGHT IN 
ARLINGTON.
CAMERON UP AT 
THE PLATE.
3 HITS AGAINST 
VICENTE PADILLA 
IN 2 INNINGS, 
THAT INCLUDES 
THE HOME RUN BY 
GONZALEZ.
IT WAS MIKE 
CAMERON THAT 
WENT DEEP ON 
SUNDAY.
HIS 4TH OF THE 
YEAR.
PART OF SAN 
DIEGO'S VICTORY 
THAT AFTERNOON 
AND TAKING 2 OUT
OF 3 FROM THE 
ANGLES.
MARK: HOW ABOUT 
MIKE AFTER 
HITTING THAT 
BALL GOING INTO 
THE DAVE PARKER 
LOOP OUT OF THE 
BATTER'S BOX.
THAT WAS SWEET.
MATT: BALL, 2 
STRIKES TO MIKE,
AND 2-2 NOW.
MIKE CAMERON HAS
EXPERIENCE 
BATTING IN THE 
LEAD-OFF SPOT.
HE HASN'T DONE 
IT A LOT AS A 
PADRE, IN FACT, 
THIS WILL BE HIS
FIRST 
OPPORTUNITY, BUT
CERTAINLY IN 133
GAMES MIKE IS 
FAMILIAR WITH 
THE NEW NUANCES OF 
OPENING AN 
INNING.
SWING AND A MISS
AND AN OPENING 
STRIKEOUT FOR 
VICENTE PADILLA 
IN THIS INNING 
TONIGHT.
MARK: HE HAS 
SHOWN A COUPLE 
OF GOOD PITCHES,
BREAKING BALL 
AND A SLIDER TO 
PUT AWAY 
CAMERON.
MATT: THAT'S THE
BALL THAT YOU 
CAN -- AS WE 
TAKE A LOOK AT 
HIM FINISHING 
OFF MIKE.
WHEN HE KEEPS 
THE LEAD-OFF GUY
OFF BASE, 
OPPONENTS HAVE 
SCORED ONLY 14% 
OF THE TIME, BUT
WHEN THAT 
LEAD-OFF REACHES
AGAINST HIM, THE
OPPONENT SCORES 
IN HALF OF THOSE
INNINGS.
THAT'S 
OVERWHELMING 
SUCCESS WHEN HE 
ALLOWS THAT 
LEAD-OFF MAN 
ABOARD.
MARK: THEN THE 
BIG KEY IS TO 
GET HIM INTO THE
STRETCH, 
CORRECT?
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND NO STRIKES 
TO BLUM WHO IN 
GOING 4 FOR 9 
AGAINST PADILLA 
WITH A COUPLE OF
HOME RUNS, 
CERTAINLY CAUGHT
BRUCE BOCHY'S 
ATTENTION WHEN 
HE WAS FIGURING 
OUT HOW TO LINE 
UP TODAY.
AND BOCH TOLD US
YESTERDAY THE 
PERILS OF AN 
OFF-DAY ON THE 
ROAD ARE THAT 
YOU MIGHT HAVE A
TENDENCY TO 
OVERTHINK THINGS
LIKE A LINE UP, 
A LINE UP 
CHANGE.
BUT I THINK BOCH
MADE UP HIS MIND
A COUPLE OF DAYS
AGO THAT CAMERON
WAS GOING TO 
LEAD OFF HERE 
TONIGHT, AND 
BUNS HE GOT A 
WHOLE OF THE 
NUMBERS INNING 
IT BECAME EASY 
FOR HIM TO GET 
BLUM IN THERE AS
WELL.
MARK: DAVE 
ROBERTS IS DOING
WELL, NO 
CRUTCHES FOR 
DAVE, HE'S WOULD
YOU BEING HIS 
OWN.
MIGHT BE A 
LITTLE MORE THAN
1 FIVE DAYS, 
IT'S A 
DAY-BY-DAY 
THING, A DEEP 
KNEE BRUISE AND 
AUTO HE'S 
WATCHING, GET 
WELL SOON.
MATT: GOT TO GET
THAT DOCTOR 
BACK.
MARK: YEAH.
MATT: BLUM LINES
THAT ONE TO MARK
TEIXEIRA WHO 
SNAGS IT AT THE 
LINE FOR OUT NO.
2.
KIDS, YOU CAN BE
A PART OF THE 
TEAM BY JOINING 
THE US BANK, 
PULL A $10 BILL 
OUT AND SEND IT 
TO THE PADRES.
GET SOME GOOD 
STUFF, POWER 
ALLEY TOKENS, A 
HAT.
KIDDING.
ASK YOUR PARENTS
BEFORE YOU RIFLE
THROUGH THE 
WALLET.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: KIDS 
SHOULDN'T BE 
WATCHING TV 
RIGHT NOW 
ANYWAY.
1-0 THE COUNT TO
GILES WITH THE 
BASES EMPTY AND 
2 GONE.
GILES SINGLED IN
THE FIRST.
BIG NUMBERS FOR 
BRIAN ON THE 
ROAD TRIP AND 
DATING BACK TO 
THE LAST HOME 
STAND.
PADRES COME BACK
HOME ON FRI, 3 
WITH SEATTLE, 
OAKLAND AND 3 
WITH THE GIANTS.
MARK: THEN WE'RE
DONE WITH 
INTERLEAGUE, 
RIGHT?
MATT: DONE.
ALTHOUGH I MUST 
SAY AFTER THE 
SUCCESS IN 
ANAHEIM, 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY
DOESN'T SEEM 
LIKE SUCH A BAD 
IDEA.
3 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE THE COUNT
TO GILES WITH 2 
GONE.
VICENTE 
PADILLA'S NEXT 
OFFERING IN FOR 
A STRIKE AGAIN, 
AND IT'S FULL 
NOW, 3-2.
HE HAS WALKED 36
ON THE YEAR, AND
THOUGH IT 
DOESN'T SEEM 
LIKE A TOTAL, IT
IS GOOD FOR THE 
8TH MOST IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE,
WALK TOTALS, 
GENERAL LOWER IN
THE A.L.
AND GILES IS 
CAUGHT LOOKING.
FROM 3-0 TO 
STRIKE 3 JUST 
LIKE THAT.
WE'RE TIED.
1-1.
MATT: A 1-1 TIE 
AS WE GO TO THE 
BOTTOM OF INNING
NO. 3.
TIME FOR 
ESURANCE 
COMPARISON OF 
THE GAME.
THE RANGERS FROM
2001 TO 2005, 
THERE'S BEEN A 
DISCREPANCY 
BETWEEN SCORING 
RUNS AND WINNING
BALL GAMES.
THEY'VE ALWAYS 
SCORED, THEY 
HAVEN'T 
NECESSARILY 
ALWAYS WON.
PITCHING HAS 
BEEN THE 
CHALLENGE HERE 
IN ARLINGTON.
MARK: I REMEMBER
ALL THOSE 
YEARS -- 
REMEMBER THEY 
SPENT A LOT OF 
MONEY ON A-ROD, 
AND EVERYBODY 
WAS LIKE, WHY 
NOT SPEND THE 
MONEY ON THE 
ROTATION?
MATT: ROD 
BARAJAS LET'S 
THINGS OFF IN 
THE BOTTOM OF 
THE THIRD.
THINGS ARE NO 
DIFFERENT THIS 
YEAR, ALTHOUGH 
IT'S NOT AS BIG 
OF A STRUGGLE AS
IT HAS BEEN IN 
THE PAST TO 
PITCH THE 
BASEBALL HERE.
EXCUSE ME-SWING 
FOUL.
BUT, AGAIN, IT'S
THE OFFENSE THAT
THE RANGERS WIN 
WITH, HERE.
THEY'VE HAD 
TROUBLE IN THE 
NO. 5 SPOT, THEY
PUT KAMERON LOE 
ON THE DISABLED 
YESTERDAY, AND 
THEY'RE GOING TO
BRING TEJEDA UP 
NEXT WEEK OFF 
THE DISABLED 
LIST.
ROD BARAJAS 
GROUNDS OUT.
1 GONE.
RANGER STARTERS 
RANK AROUND THE 
MIDDLE OF THE 
PACK IN QUALITY 
STARTS.
AND WHEN THEY 
GET A GUY GOING 
6, 7 INNINGS, 
THEY WIN AND 
THAT'S CERTAINLY
NO DIFFERENT 
ANYWHERE ELSE IN
MAJOR LEAGUE 
BASEBALL BUT
OVERALL THE TEAM
E.R.A. OF 7.1 
RANKS 11TH IN 
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE.
THERE'S A SHOT 
OF LOE AND 
MILLWOOD, AND 
THEY'RE BRINGING
MILLWOOD ON A 
BIG FREE AGENT 
DEAL TO HOPE HE 
CAN SOLIDIFY THE
ROTATION.
HE GOES 
TOMORROW.
0-1 TO GARY 
MATTHEWS, NOW 
0-2.
GARY MATTHEWS 
TRYING TO 
CONVERT ON THE 
AN 8-GAME 
HITTING STREAK 
HERE TONIGHT.
HE WALKED ON HIS
FIRST PLATE 
APPEARANCE.
FLY BALL INTO 
LEFT.
GOT A MAN THERE.
BEEN JOHNSON 
MAKES THE CATCH.
6 IN A ROW 
RETIRED BY MIKE 
THOMPSON.
SO NOW MICHAEL 
YOUNG WHO 
GROUNDED INTO A 
DOUBLE PLAY IN 
THE FIRST, WE 
TALKED ABOUT ALL
THE CATEGORIES 
THAT YOUNG IS 
FOUND ON LEAGUE 
LEADER BOARDS, 
AS FAR AS 
RANGERS TEAM 
HISTORY, YOUNG 
HAS HAD 5 NOKZ 
IN A GAME TWICE 
AND ONLY SORIANO
HAS DONE IS MORE
TIMES IN
FRANCHISE 
HISTORY.
TWICE THIS 
SEASON.
HE'S DONE IT ON 
A COUPLE OF 
OTHER OCCASIONS 
PREVIOUSLY.
FOULS THAT ONE 
AWAY AND IT'S A 
BALL AND A 
STRIKE.
MICHAEL YOUNG 
JOINS JETER AND 
OTHERS AS A 
5-HIT GAME 
RANGER.
MARK: I LIKE THE
WAY I HACKS THE 
BAT, TOO, HUH?
HE SWINGS THAT 
SHILLELAGH, 
BELIEVE THAT.
MICHAEL YOUNG 
LED THE RANGERS 
IN HITS AND 
AVERAGE, '03, 
'04, '05, HE'S 
CONSISTENT.
LET'S SEE HIS 
APPROACH IN THE 
HOLE.
MATT: AFTER THAT
SERIES WE TALKED
ABOUT BETWEEN 
THE RANGERS AND 
THE WHITE SOX 
LAST WEEK THAT 
OZZIE SAID "I 
WANT THIS GUY ON
MY ALL-STAR TEAM
PLAYING FOR THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
ON JULY 11TH.
THAT'S GROUNDED 
TO VINNY.
THREE OUTS BY 
MIKE THOMPSON.
TIED 1 APIECE.
MATT: TIED AT 1 
AS WE GO TO THE 
TOP HALF OF THE 
4TH.
PIAZZA, GONZALEZ
AND BARD, 
VICENTE PADILLA 
BACK TO WORK AND
HE STARTS MIKE 
WITH STRIKE 1.
PLENTY OF 
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
EASTERN DIVISION
HEAD-TO-HEAD 
MATCH-UPS 
BETWEEN MIKE AND
VICENTE PADILLA,
AND, IN FACT, 
HE'S SEEN 
VICENTE PADILLA 
MORE THAN ANY 
OTHER PADRE.
POPPED BEHIND 
THE PLATE AND A 
NICE EFFORT BY 
ROD BARAJAS, 
KNOCKING A GUY 
OUT IN THE 
CHOPS.
MARK: THAT WAS A
GREAT EFFORT BY 
ROD.
HE GETS TO THE 
FARTHEST POINT 
AND HE DRAWS 
LEVEL ON THAT 
BALL.
DOES THE GUY 
DROP HIS BEER IN
THAT'S PETE 
RIPOVICH.
MATT: 0-2 TO 
PIAZZA.
MIKE IS STILL 
ALIVE AT 0-2.
MARK: ROD GOT 
THAT FOUL TIP 
RIGHT BETWEEN 
HIS CHEST 
PROTECTOR AND 
HIS MASK.
IT RATTLED 
AROUND HIS CHIN 
T LOOKED LIKE.
CHECK OUT THIS 
FOUL TIP.
SO YOU WANT TO 
BE A CATCHER, 
HUH?
GOT IT RIGHT ON 
THE GRILL.
MATT: GUYS ARE 
GETTING READY 
FOR THE MAVS 
GAME.
EITHER THAT OR 
THEY'RE GETTING 
READY FOR THEIR 
UP WITH PEOPLE 
REVIAL.
THERE IS A 
BETTER CROWD 
HERE THAN I 
ANTICIPATED 
TONIGHT.
MARK: I'M 
GUESSING 23,000.
MATT: WHEN THIS 
PLACE OPENED IN 
'94, IT WAS SELL
OUT AFTER SELL 
OUT AFTER SELL 
OUT, AND IT WAS 
ONE OF THE FIRST
OF THE WHOLE NEW
BALLPARK -- THAT
ERA IN THE 
MIDDLE 90'S, THE
FIRST BEING 
CAMDEN YARDS, 
AND THEN JACOBS 
FIELD, AND MARK 
DeROSA BACK TO 
MAKE THE CATCH 
OF THE SMACH 
INTO FIELD.
TIME FOR THE 
AFLAC TRIVIA 
QUESTION.
TONIGHT WE ASK 
WHO IS THE FIRST
MANAGER IN TEXAS
RANGERS HISTORY?
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
NOW, HIS SOLO 
HOME RUN LEADING
THINGS OFF IN 
THE SECOND PUT 
THE PADRES ON 
THE SCORE BOARD 
AND PULLED THEM 
EVEN EARLY 
TONIGHT.
VICENTE PADILLA 
STARTS HIM WITH 
A FASTBALL FOR A
STRIKE.
PADILLA WORKING 
QUICKLY, MISSING
THE OUTSIDE 
CORNER, THERE.
1-1 HOME.
I THINK THIS 
CITY, DALLAS, 
THE GREATER DFW 
METRO PLEX, AND 
MIAMI, 
CERTAINLY, AS 
THEY'RE THE TWO 
CITIES INVOLVED 
IN THE NBA, THEY
CARE ABOUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
IN BASKETBALL 
RIGHT NOW, BUT I
DON'T KNOW THAT 
THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY IS TUNED
N. THE WORLD CUP
OUTRATED THE NBA
FINALS FOR GAME 
4.
MARK: WOW!
MATT: GONZALEZ 
SPRAYS A GROUND 
BALL TO 
SHORTSTOP FOR 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
AND 2 QUICK OUTS
FOR PADILLA IN 
THE 4TH.
MARK: DID YOU 
HEAR MARK IS UP 
TO HIS OLD 
TRICKS AGAIN, 
FIND $250,000, 
ASHTRAY CHANGE 
TO MR. CUBAN.
MATT: THEY LOVE 
HIM HERE.
MARK: YEAH, THEY
DO.
MATT: HERE IS 
BARD WITH 2 
GONE.
BARD WAS CAUGHT 
LOOKING AT A 
CALLED-STRIKE 3 
BACK IN THE 
SECOND.
AND A BREAKING 
BALL IS TAKEN 
FOR STRIKE 1.
MARK: DID YOU 
NOTICE PAD VICENTE 
PADILLA WORKS 
QUICKLY WHEN 
THERE IS NO ONE 
ON BASE?
AS OPPOSED TO 
HIS STRETCH 
POSITION, HIS 
WIND-UP IS 
DIFFERENT, TOO.
MATT: WELL, WITH
PADILLA AND 
MILLWOOD, THE 
TWO BIGGEST 
NAMES TTHEIR 
PITCHING STAFF 
IN 2006, THE 
RANGERS TRIED TO
RECTIFY WHAT 
THEY DISCUSSED 
EARLIER, THE 
FACT THAT THIS 
HAD BEEN AN 
ALL-HIT, 
NO-PITCH TEAM 
FOR SUCH A LONG 
TIME.
PADILLA COMING 
HERE VIA TRADE 
AND HE FIRES A 
STRIKE TO BARD, 
2-2.
BACK UP THE 
MIDDLE AND 
THROUGH.
SO A 2-OUT 
SINGLE FOR BARD.
THAT'S HIT NO. 4
FOR SAN DIEGO 
TONIGHT.
AND IT WILL GIVE
A 2-OUT 
OPPORTUNITY NOW 
TO KHALIL 
GREENE.
GREENIE IS THE 
KEY GUY.
CHECKING IN AT 
.214 TONIGHT.
BEEN A WHILE 
SINCE KHALIL 
LAST WENT DEEP.
AND AS THE 
PADRES HAVE HAD 
TROUBLE FINDING 
A CLEAN-UP 
HITTER AND 
GETTING 
PRODUCTIVITY OUT
OF THE MIDDLE OF
THE LINEUP, IT 
SEEMS AS THOUGH 
THEY WOULD LIKE 
KHALIL TO BE 
THAT GUY.
BUT, AGAIN, THE 
PRODUCTIVITY 
JUST HASN'T BEEN
THERE OVER THE 
LAST MONTH.
MARK: WE'VE 
HEARD IT ALL 
ALONG, MATTY, 
THIS IS ONE GUY 
THAT MERV 
RETTENMUND IS 
TRYING TO WORK 
WITH AND GET 
GOING.
AND MERV SAID IN
THE REGAME SHOW,
NOT ONLY KNOWING
THE GUYS' 
SWINGS, HE CAN 
GET THAT DOWN IN
ONE DAY.
IT'S GOOD TO 
KNOW WHAT'S 
GOING ON BETWEEN
THE EARS.
MERV SAID ON THE
PLANE AFTER 
WATCHING 
GREENIE, HE SAID
"HE'S A GOOD 
ONE."
HE HAS SUCH HIGH
POTENTIAL.
WE AUNL THAT. 
MATT: IT'S BEEN 
A SOLID MONTH 
SINCE GREENE'S 
LAST HOME RUN, 
MAY 20TH AGAINST
SEATTLE.
AND YOU TALK TO 
SOME AND IT'S A 
MECHANICS ISSUE 
WITH KHALIL 
BEING A FEEL 
HITTER AND THE 
FACT THAT HE'S 
CONSTANTLY 
FEELING 
DIFFERENT AND 
CHANGING HIS 
STANCE AND 
APPROACH, 
SEEMINGLY AT-BAT
TO AT-BAT, THERE
ARE THOSE THAT 
FEEL LIKE IT'S 
GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT TO GET
INTO RHYTHM WHEN
YOU'RE DEALING 
WITH YOURSELF 
LIKE THAT, BUT 
THEN YOU CAN 
LOOK AT A GUY 
LIKE CAL RIPKEN 
AND SAY, THAT'S 
NOT TRUE, 
BECAUSE HE DID 
THAT ALL THE 
TIME, AND LOOK 
AT WHAT HE DID.
MARK: IT'S 
ALMOST LIKE A 
PITCHER CHANGING
HIS DELIVERY 
EACH AND EVERY 
PITCH.
GUYS TRYING TO 
BE CONSISTENT.
SOMETIMES THEY 
WILL ALTER THE 
RELEASE POINT 
AND THE ARM 
ANGLE ON CERTAIN
PITCHES, BUT 
MECHANICALLY 
SPEAKING, YOUR 
BODY IS PRETTY 
MUCH THE SAME.
MATT: BLEW A 
FASTBALL PAST 
HIM.
NOTHING IN THE 
SAN DIEGO 4TH, 
MATT: TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
INNING ASK WE 
ANSWER THE AFLAC
QUESTION.
WHO IS THE FIRST
MANAGER OF THE 
RANGERS?
TED WILLIAMS, 
MANAGED THE TEAM
FOR 3 YEARS IN 
WASHINGTON AND 
THEN MOVED WITH 
THE TEAM TO 
ARLINGTON FOR 
THEIR IN
THEIR INNAGURAL 
SEASON, HERE.
TED WILLIAMS, IS
DO AS I DO, NOT 
AS A SAY, AND 
TED WAS ALWAYS 
FRUSTRATED WITH 
THE FACT THAT 
PLAYERS COULDN'T
DO PHYSICALLY 
WHAT HE WAS ABLE
TO DO IN THEIR 
SPOTS AND NEVER 
HAD ANY SUCCESS 
MANAGING WHAT 
WAS IN HIS 
DEFENSE A BAD 
RANGERS TEAM. 
MARK: A BAD, BAD
TEAM, AND THEN 
YOU GO ON -- 
THERE'S TOM 
GRIEV WHO USED 
TO BE THE 
MANAGER FOR THE 
TEXAS RANGERS 
AND HE PLAYED 
FOR TED 
WILLIAMS, HERE 
IN TEXAS, FATHER
OF BEN GRIEV.
MATT: HANK 
BLALOCK WITH 1 
GONE, HE SINGLED
IN THAT FIRST 
INNING SCORE FOR
THE RANGERS.
YOU KNOW, THE 
RANGERS WHEN 
THEY FIRST MOVED
HERE, THEY DID 
NOT HAVE A LOT 
OF CONTINUITY IN
THAT MANAGERIAL 
SEAT, IN FACT, 
BEFORE BOBBY 
VALENTINE SPENT 
ALMOST EIGHT 
YEARS HERE AS A 
MANAGER, THE 
LONGEST STINT 
THAT ANY RANGER 
MANAGER HAD WAS 
3 YEARS.
MARK: LET ME 
GUESS SOME GUYS 
IN BETWEEN.
WHITEY HERZOG, 
BILLY MARTIN, 
BUDDY BELL -- 
NO, HE PLAYED 
HERE.
MATT: RIGHT.
DONE ZIMMER 
PLAYED HERE, 
FRANK LACASEY 
MANAGED HERE FOR
3-PLUS YEARS.
THERE'S A LINE 
DRIVE FOR A HIT.
BLA INTLA A PURE
HITTER AS HE 
SINGLES INTO 
LEFT, 2 FOR 2 
TONIGHT.
MARK: SHARPLY 
LIT TO LEFT, AND
HE CAN TURN ON 
ONE AND PUT IT 
OUT OF THE 
BALLPARK AND 
HURT YOU THAT 
WAY, TOOCHLT 
SECOND TIME THIS
EVENING HE HAS 
GONE THE 
OPPOSITE WAY.
MATT: SO A 1-OUT
BATTER IN FRONT 
OF MARK DeROSA 
NOW.
HE GROUNDED INTO
A FIELDER'S 
CHOICE PLAY THAT
ENDED THE FIRST.
FIRST BATTER 
AGAINST MIKE 
THOMPSON SINCE 
THE FIRST 
INNING.
IT ENDS A 
STRETCH OF 8 IN 
A ROW RETIRED.
SO FAR SO GOOD 
FOR MIKE IN HIS 
FIRST GO-ROUND 
AGAINST AN 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
OPPONENT.
IT'S ONE THING 
WHEN YOU'RE -- 
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
GETTING THAT 
FIRST-EVER START
AGAINST THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
AGAINST THE 
ROYALS AT HOME, 
YOU KNOW, BUT HE
HAPPENS TO BE 
DEALING TO ONE 
OF THE MOST 
POTENT TEAMS IN 
BASEBALL ON HIR 
HOME TURF IN HIS
FIRST GO-ROUND.
MARK: IT'S A 
HIGH, FASTBALL 
HITTING TEAM.
THEY LIKE THE 
FASTBALL.
YOU CAN JUDGE 
THAT.
SO WHAT DO YOU 
DO?
YOU TAKE THE 
STING OUT OF THE
BAT.
HE'S THROWING 
CHANGE-UPS, 
PITCHING 
BACKWARDS, ON A 
FASTBALL COUNT 
HE WILL FLIP UP 
A BREAKING BALL,
TAKE A LITTLE 
OFF HIS FASTBALL
AND TRY TO MAKE 
THEM FISH FOR 
PITCHES LIKE 
THAT WHEN HE'S 
AHEAD.
I CAN GUARANTEE 
YOU ONE THING 
MIKE THOMPSON IN
A 2-2 COUNT WITH
A RUNNER ON HE'S
NOT GOING TO 
THROW A FASTBALL
FOR A STRIKE 
DOWN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE PLATE.
MATT: SAN 
DIEGO'S TURNED 1
DOUBLE PLAY 
TONIGHT, MARK 
DeROSA LINES UP 
THE MIDDLE AND 
WENT OUT AND GOT
THAT BALL.
BACK-TO-BACK 
1-OUT SIN GELS, 
AND TEXAS IS IN 
BUSINESS HERE IN
THE 4TH.
MARK: WE 
MENTIONED IN THE
PREGAME SHOW HOW
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THE BALL DOWN 
AND MARK DeROSA 
GOES DOWN AND 
GETS THAT ONE.
AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT, IF HE 
REACHES FOR IT 
LIKE THAT, HITS 
IT IN THE SWEET 
SPOT, A 1-HOPPER
TO CENTER FIELD 
YOU'LL TAKE IT.
YOU WOULD RATHER
HAVE HIM DO THAT
THAN HAVE A 
2-RUN SHOT.
MATT: SO NOW 
KEVIN MENCH, THE
D.H., HE HAS 
BEEN SWINGING A 
HOT BAT WITH 9 
KNOCKS IN HIS 
LAST 8 GAMES.
SPEAKING OF 
STREAKS, IT 
WASN'T TOO LONG 
AGO BACK IN 
APRIL THAT KEVIN
MENCH PUT 
TOGETHER A VERY 
IMPRESSIVE 
STREAK, TOMORROW
SON WORKING TO 
HIM OUT OF THE 
STRETCH AND MISS
TO GO MAKE IT 
2-0.
HOME RUNS IN 7 
CONSECUTIVE 
GAMES AND IN 
FACT, MISSED 
TYING A MAJOR 
LEAGUE RECORD 
FOR HOME RUNS IN
CONSECUTIVE 
AFFAIRS.
A BOUNCING BALL 
TO THIRD.
CASTILLA TO 
BLUM, THAT'S ALL
THEY GET AS THEY
CUT DOWN THE 
MIDDLEMAN, NO 
RELAY THROW, 
RUNNERS AT THE 
CORNER IS WITH 2
GONE.
MARK: LOOKED 
LIKE BLUM AT 
SECOND BASE 
COULDN'T FIND 
THE HANDLE.
CASTILLA GOT THE
BALL NICE AND 
MADE A FEED TO 
GEOFF.
HE CANNOT FIND 
IT.
MATT: NOW THE 
SOUTH SWINGING 
BRAD WILKERSON, 
HE GROUNDED TO 
SHORT IN HIS 
FIRST AT-BAT 
TONIGHT.
BOUNCING BALL TO
SECOND.
SO BACK-TO-BACK 
1-OUT SINGLES, 
BUT THE RANGERS 
ARE TURNED AWAY 
IN THE 4TH.
TIED.AT INSURANCE ?
WHAT INSURANCE
IS THAT YOGI ?
AFLAC.
[ Duck grunts ]
THE ONE YA' REALLY
NEED TO HAVE...
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED IT.
NEED WHAT ?
AFLAC.
WELL, IF YOU GET HURT
AND MISS WORK IT WON'T HURT
TO MISS WORK.
HUH ?
AND THEY GIVE YA' CASH
WHICH IS JUST AS GOOD AS MONEY.
AFLAC.
ASK ABOUT IT AT WORK.
[ Duck grunts ]
MATT: AFTER A 
STRONG START 
OFFENSIVELY, 
THIS HAS SETTLED
INTO A PITCHERS 
DO YOU LIVE 
DUAL, 1-1 TIE, 
AS CASTILLA 
LEADS THINGS 
OFF, CASTILLA, 
JOHNSON AND 
CAMERON HERE 
AGAINST VICENTE 
PADILLA, A RUN 
ON HITS FOR BOTH
THE RANGERS AND 
THE PADRES HERE 
TONIGHT.
VINNY SENDS ONE 
INTO RIGHT 
CENTER FIELD, 
MARK DeROSA AND 
GARY MATTHEWS 
ARE BACK, LOOK 
AT VINNY, A 
DOUBLES MACHINE.
A PAIR OF 
2-BAGGERS FOR 
VINNY TO START 
THE NIGHT.
MARK: DO YOU 
WANT ME TO SAY 
IT OR NOT?
MATT: SAY IT.
MARK: IT'S AN IN
AND OUT NIGHT 
FORECAST 
CASTILLA, 
DOUBLE/DOUBLE W.
YOU KNOW HE PUT 
SOME CHEESE ON 
THAT ONE.
VINNY TOO HOT 
FOR TV, 
UNDESCRIBABLE.
HE'S DOING 
DAMAGE WITHIN 
HIS 10TH DOUBLE.
VINNY SAID HE'S 
BEEN DOING 
DAMAGE SINCE 
HE'S BEEN SIX 
YEARS OLD, 
SWINGING THE 
BAT.
MATT: HERE IS 
BEN JOHNSON, AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO 
DO SOME DAMAGE 
HERE, A RUNNER 
IN SCORING 
POSITION.
MARK: GOT TO 
KNOCK IT TO THE 
RIGHT SIDE, MARK
TEIXEIRA IS 
PLAYING WELL OFF
THE BAG AT FIRST
BASE.
MATT: HOW ABOUT 
VINNY, THOUGH, 
MUDCAT?
WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT A VETERAN 
GUY WHO A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAD 
WRITTEN OFF AS 
DONE.
BEN JOHNSON INTO
THE CORNER, 
THAT'S TROUBLE.
FOUL IN RIGHT.
MARK: OH, MAN!
MATT: WOW!
IT LOOKED LIKE 
THIS BALL 
DROPPED INTO 
FAIR TERRITORY, 
BUT FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE BILL 
WILKIE WAS ON 
IT.
MARK: FROM OUR 
VANT VANTAGE UP 
HERE IN THE 
BOOTH, THAT 
RIGHT FIELD 
DISAPPEARS ON 
US.
HE GETS THAT 
BALL QUICKER OUT
IN FRONT, THAT'S
TROUBLE.
HE JUST MISSED 
IT.
MATT: AND HE 
SHOOTS THAT ONE 
FOUL.
MARK: WHAT'S 
WITH THESE NETS?
THERE'S ONE DOWN
THE LEFT FIELD 
LINE AND ONE 
DOWN THE RIGHT 
FIELD LINE.
MATT: PERFECTLY 
LEGAL.
MARK: REALLY?
MATT: YEAH.
I THINK IT'S UP 
TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL CLUB 
AS FAR AS IF 
THEY HAVE A NET 
POLICY BUT THERE
IS NOTHING ON 
THE MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL LINE 
THAT SAYS YOU 
CAN'T BRING A 
FISHING NET TO 
THE BALL GAME.
MARK: I SEE THAT
GUY HAS ONE.
IS THAT 
SPIELBERG?
MATT: THAT GUY 
LOOKED LIKE THE 
ACTOR, DANIEL --
ANYWAY, JOHNSON 
SHOOTS IT INTO 
THE CORNER, 
AGAIN FOUL.
HE'S REALLY 
PLAYING WITH 
RIGHT FIELD 
HERE.
YOU GOT TO LIKE 
THE APPROACH, 
LOOKING TO SEND 
STUFF INTO THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER 
AND JOHNSON HAS 
BEEN WIDE ON T. 
MARK: IF A 
PITCHER IS OUT 
ON THE MOUND AND
HE KEEPS SEEING 
THAT, LET'S SEE 
IF HE TRIES TO 
BUZZ ONE INSIDE 
ON HIM, HERE.
MATT: WHAT'S THE
NAME OF THIS 
GUY, MUDCAT?
DANIEL STERN.
MARK: GUY FROM 
"CITY SLICKERS?"
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: NO POINT 
ON THAT ONE, MY 
FRIEND.
MATT: PARTIALLY 
OBSCURED BY THE 
VISOR.
2-2 NOW.
MARK: I'M COMING
RIGHT BACK 
INSIDE HERE, 
NOW, MATTY.
MATT: OKAY.
MIKE CAMERON 
NEXT.
CASTILLA 
REPRESENTING THE
GO-AHEAD RUN ON 
SECOND BASE.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOING AWAY,
THOUGH.
MATT: 1 AWAY AND
STRUCK HIM OUT.
MARK: WELL, IT'S
THE RIGHT PITCH,
OBVIOUSLY, FROM 
VICENTE PADILLA,
AND THE REASON 
WHY I THINK HE 
WENT BACK OUT 
THERE IS BECAUSE
HE WOULD RATHER 
MISS DOWN AND 
AWAY TO BEN 
JOHNSON RATHER 
THAN TRYING TO 
COME OVER THE 
PLATE AND 
GETTING HURT.
EARL IN THE 
COUNT BEN HAD 
THE RIGHT 
APPROACH AND 
PADILLA WINS THE
BATTLE ON THAT 
ONE.
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON TRYING 
TO PICK UP THE 
BATTER, FASTBALL
STAYS HIGH TO 
MIKE.
CAMERON 0-2 
TONIGHT SO FAR 
TONIGHT.
SEE IF I CAN 
PICK UP VINNY TO
MAKE IT A 2-1 
SAN DIEGO GAME.
WE MENTIONED HOW
THE ALL-TIME 
SEASON SERIES 
BETWEEN -- THE 
ALL-TIME SERIES 
THAT IS BETWEEN 
TEXAS AND SAN 
DIEGO IS EVEN AT
8 APIECE. THE 
PADRES ARE 6-2 
IN SAN DIEGO, 
2-6 HERE AT THE 
BALLPARK IN 
ARLINGTON.
THERE ARE SO 
MANY NAMES AND 
FACES THAT ARE 
DIFFERENT ON 
THIS ROSTER.
COMPARING IT TO 
THE LAST ONE 
THAT PLAYED THE 
RANGERS IN 
INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY.
ABOUT THE ONLY 
REAL 
CONSISTENCY, 
HERE, STARTS AT 
THE TOP WITH 
BRUCE BOCHY.
3 BALLS AND NO 
STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO 
CAMERON.
LET'S SEE HOW 
CAREFUL VICENTE 
PADILLA IS WITH 
A BASE OPEN AND 
ONE GONE.
3-1.
MARK: EVEN 
LOOKED LIKE 
PADILLA ON THAT 
3-0 PITCH EASED 
UP A LITTLE BIT.
IT WASN'TS THE 
100% EFFORT ON 
THAT FASTBALL.
HITTING THE 
CORNER TO MAKE 
IT 3-1.
HE MIGHT THROW 
HIM A BREAKING 
BALL HERE.
MATT: INSTEAD 
IT'S BALL 4.
HE THREW HIM A 
FASTBALL THERE 
ON 3-1.
WOW.
DON'T EVEN 
BOTHER WIPING 
IT, DUDE.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: I THINK HE
STILL HAS PART 
OF A HOT DOG 
FROM A COWBOYS 
GAME LEFT OVER 
FROM THE FALL IN
THAT THING.
[CHUCKLES] HERE 
IS BLUM WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND.
MARK: WE NEED AN
EXTRA-BASE HIT 
HERE, MATTY.
MATT: BLUM 0-2 
SO FAR TONIGHT.
MARK: GOOD TIME 
TO BREAK OUT THE
RALLY STICK.
THAT TOOK CARE 
OF THE MONKEY 
STICK IN 
ANAHEIM, HUH?
MATT: I USED TO 
HATE THE RALLY 
MONKEY.
I LIKE HIM NOW.
THE THINGS 
THEY'VE DONE 
WITH HIM ON THE 
SCOREBOARD?
1-1 TO BLUM.
THESE ARE 
SITUATIONS WHERE
VICENTE PADILLA 
HAS GOTTEN 
TOUGH.
WITH RUNNERS IN 
SCORING POSITION
HITTERS ARE 
HITTING .31 
.217, AND WITH 
NO ONE ABOARD, 
HE'S LETTING THE
HITTERS HIT 
.302.
2 GONE IN THE 
SWIRLING WIND, 
AND HANK IS ABLE
TO MAKE THAT 
CATCH. IT IS 
BLOWING TONIGHT.
MARK: SOME FRIAR
FAITHFUL HERE IN
ARLINGTON.
SPORTING THE 
CAMEL JERSEY.
MATT: SO NOW IT 
WILL BE UP TO 
GILES WITH 2 
GONE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE WHAT VICENTE
PADILLA DID THAT
AT-BAT, MATTY?
OFF SPEED, 
POPPING HIM UP 
IN THE INFIELD.
AND WITH ONE OUT
AND THAT POP-UP,
THE INFIELD FLY 
RULE WAS IN 
EFFECT.
BATTER OUT, 
RUNNERS ADVANCE 
AT YOUR OWN 
RISK.
MATT: PIAZZA 
NEXT WITH 2 
GONE.
HERE'S GILES WHO
SINGLED, IN HIS 
FIRST TRY TONE.
THAT BALL HITS 
HIM.
THE WAY BRIAN 
REACTED IT WAS 
ALMOST AS THOUGH
IT MISSED HIM 
AND IT WASN'T 
UNTIL THE UMPIRE
SAID "TAKE YOUR 
BASE," THAT WE 
WERE SURE BRIAN 
WAS HIT BY THAT 
BALL.
MARK: THAT'S THE
FIRST PITCH HE 
THREW TO GEOFF 
BLUM AT THE 
AT-BAT, AUSHLGS 
AND IT GETS HIM 
RIGHT IN THE 
UNCLE HULKA, 
RIGHT ON THE BIG
TOE.
MATT: THIS IS 
WHERE SAN DIEGO 
NEEDS TO COME UP
WITH A BIG BLOW,
YOU DON'T NEED 
US TO TELL YOU 
THAT.
BIG BASES LOADED
CAREER NUMBERS.
SEEN PLENTY OF 
VICENTE PADILLA,
SACKS FULL, 2 
GONE, THIS IS 
SAN DIEGO'S BEST
OPPORTUNITY TO 
HANG A CROOKED 
NUMBER ALL 
NIGHT.
MARK: AND THE 
KEY IS FOR 
PIAZZA NOT TO 
PULL, SEE HIM 
TRYING THERE, 
MATTY, STAYING 
INSIDE OF IT 
NICELY?
MATT: PADILLA'S 
THROWN 88 
PITCHES TONIGHT,
AND I WOULD 
ALMOST SAY 
QUIETLY.
THAT PITCH COUNT
HAS RIS ENTO THE
POINT WHERE BUCK
SHOWALTER IS 
WATCHING THE 
NUMBER.
MARK: 33'S, 5'S, 
AND 8'S.
MATT: HERE IS 
THE NOTHING-1 TO
PIAZZA, SWUNG ON
AND SHOT INTO 
RIGHT FIELD, THE
BASE HIT WILL 
SCORE A RUN, 
THEY'LL WAVE 
MIKE CAMERON 
AROUND.
PIAZZA COMES 
THROUGH WITH THE
BASES LOADED.
ON QUE, PARTNER,
MUD TALKED ABOUT
MIKE LOOKING TO 
RIGHT FIELD AND 
ON THE SECOND 
PITCH OF THE 
AT-BAT, THAT'S 
WHERE THE LOVE 
COMES, OUT TO 
RIGHT FIELD AS 
HE DRIVES IN A 
PAIR TO MAKE IT 
3-1 FRIARS.
MARK: OH LOTTA 
LOVE.
TO RIGHT CENTER.
OH YEAH, BELIEVE
THAT.
MATT: IT WILL 
BRING THE 
PITCHING COACH, 
MARK CONNOR OUT 
TO THE MOUND FOR
THE FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
MIKE PIAZZA 
GIVES THE PADRES
A 2-RUN LEAD 
HERE IN THE 5TH.
MARK: THAT BALL 
GOES ON THE 
OUTSIDE AND 
PIAZZA STAYS ON 
IT NICELY.
WITH 2 OUTS, 
TREVOR HOFFMAN 
IS WAVING AROUND
CAMERON, RUNNING
ON THE HIT, 
RUNNING ON 
CONTACT.
MATT: THAT IS A 
VINTAGE PIAZZA 
SWING, TOO.
IT ALMOST LOOKS 
LIKE MIKE'S 
WEIGHT IS 
SHIFTING TOWARD 
HIS BACK LEG 
FROM THE MOMENT 
THE PITCH LEAVES
THE HEAD.
IT LOOKS LIKE 
HE'S ON HIS 
HEELS.
AND HE'S LIENING LEANING 
BACK.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
UP NOW, 0-1 TO 
HIM.
AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR MORE NOW 
WITH SAN DIEGO'S
HOTEST POWER BAT
ON THE TRIP.
GILES AT SECOND,
PIAZZA THE 
RUNNER AT FIRST,
2 RUNS IN WITH 2
GONE.
HE WAS LEADING 
OFF THE SECOND 
AND ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ 
DELIVERED OUR 
COORS LITE HIT.
A DRIVING HOME 
RUN, NO. 10 OF 
THE YEAR AND 
THAT TIED US ONE
APIECE.
MARK: LOOKS 
LIKE -- BRING A 
GLOVE TO THE 
BALLPARK NEXT 
TIME, BUDDY.
MATT: ADRIAN 
BEHIND HERE, 
0-2.
MARK: TONIGHT 
ANOTHER POINT 
ABOUT PAD YASHGS
MATTY, I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM GET 
HURT ON BREAKING
BALLS.
ALL OF HIS 
PITCHES, 
TONIGHT, I THINK
ON HITS THAT 
HAVE REALLY 
MATTERED HAVE 
BEEN ON THE 
FASTBALL.
HE'S MISSING 
WITH LOCATION ON
THE FASTBALL.
MATT: REMEMBER 
THE CRITICISM ON
PADILLA FOR A 
COUPLE OF YEARS 
IN PHILLY WAS 
FOCUS.
MARK: YES.
MATT: GONZALEZ 
SHOOTS THAT ONE 
FOUL.
HE HAD, AT 
TIMES, A RATHER 
ACRIMONIOUS 
RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE FRONT 
OFFICE 
PERSONNEL, AND 
EVEN COACHING 
STAFF IN 
PHILADELPHIA.
THERE WAS MORE 
THAN 1 BASEBALL 
PUNDANT THAT 
LOOKED AT THAT 
TRADE AND SAID
VICENTE PADILLA 
MORE THAN 
SERVICEABLE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
STARTER AND HE 
WAS EXCHANGED 
FOR NOT A WHOLE 
LOT IN 
COMPENSATION, 
ALMOST TO 
INDICATE THE 
PHILLIES WANTED 
TO UNLOAD HIM.
HE GETS ADRIAN 
HERE WITH A 
PITCH THAT 
CATCHES THE 
OUTSIDE CORNER.
THE DAMAGE DONE,
THOUGH, THE 
PIAZZA 2-RUN 
SINGLE MAKES IT 
3-1 SAN DIEGO.
MATT: PADRE 
FANS, HERE IN 
TEXAS THESE 
DAYS, A LOT OF 
FANS HAVE MADE 
THE TRIP TO 
ARLINGTON.
WE'RE NOT SURE 
IF THEY TRAVELED
IN FROM SAN 
DIEGO OR IF 
THEY'RE 
DISPLACED SAN 
DIEGO PEOPLE, WE
WELCOME THEM.
A DRIVE INTO 
CENTER FIELD 
THAT GETS OVER 
MIKE CAMERON, WE
HAVEN'T SAID 
THAT OFTEN THIS 
YEAR.
AND A 
FIRST-PITCH 
DOUBLE GREETS 
TWOM TOMORROW IN
THE LAST OF THE 
5TH.
MARK: MATTY, 
TALKED TO A LOT 
OF OUTFIELDER, 
AND IT'S TOUGH 
TO JUDGE THAT 
BALL OFF THE BAT
WHEN IT'S HIT 
DIRECTLY AT YOU 
OVER YOUR HEAD.
HE SQUARES UP ON
THIS BALL NICELY
AND LOOK AT 
MIKE, RIGHT OVER
HIS HEAD, 
DIRECTLY OVER 
HIS HEAD.
KID HAS SOME 
POP, NOW.
MENTIONED IN THE
MINOR LEAGUES IN
'05 HE HIT 25 
HOME RUNS.
MATT: ROD 
BARAJAS WITH A 
CHANCE TO DRIVE 
IN A RUN NOW, 
IAN KINSLER AT 
SECOND TO LEAD 
THINGS OFF, AS 
BARAJAS TAKES A 
STRIKE.
HE HAS HEATED 
UP.
BY THE WAY, IT'S
NOT NEARLY AS 
HOT DOWN HERE AT
GAME TIME AS WE 
WERE FEARING.
WE WERE LOOKING 
FOR TEMPERATURES
STILL IN THE 
90S, AND GILES 
OVER PLAYS THE 
BALL, AND IT 
WOULDN'T MATTER,
IAN KINSLER WAS 
GOING TO SCORE 
ANYWAY, 
BACK-TO-BACK 
OPEN THE 5TH 
EXAMINE BRING 
THE RANGERS TO 
WITHIN A RUN.
MARK: IDEALLY 
YOU WOULD LIKE 
TO KEEP ROD 
BARAJAS ON FIRST
BASE.
HE DOESN'T RUN 
ALL THAT WELL.
BRIAN OVERRUNS 
THAT AND WITH 
THAT
MISQUE, AND ROD 
BARAJAS WILL 
TAKE THE EXTRA 
90 FEET.
MATT: BACK TO 
THE TOP OF THE 
ORDER NOW, GARY 
MATTHEWS, JUNIOR
WHO HAS WALKED 
AND FLIED TO 
LEFT.
GETTING INTO THE
SCARY PART OF 
THIS RANGER 
LINEUP NOW, AND 
THERE'S NO PLACE
TO HIDE IN IT, 
BUT EVERY TIME 
YOU LOOK AT GARY
MATTHEWS, YOUNG,
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
AND HANK 
BLALOCK, YOU GOT
TO WORK PRETTY 
HARD, HERE.
MARK: UH-HUH.
YOU SEE GARY 
MATTHEWS DID THE
FIRST PITCH?
HE SHOWED BUNT, 
AND VINNY WAS 
CREEPING IN AND 
SWINGING AWAY 
THE SECOND 
PITCH.
MATT: POPPED HIM
UP.
CAMERON IN FROM 
CENTER.
BOY, THAT'S A 
BIG OUT AS ROD 
BARAJAS HAS TO 
HOLD AT SECOND.
1 GONE.
I CAN'T TELL BY 
THE WAY, WHEN 
THAT -- I CAN'T 
TELL IF THE WIND
IS KNOCKING 
THINGS DOWN OR 
SWIRLING BALLS 
OR PUSHING THEM 
OUT.
IT SEEMS TO 
CHANGE WITH 
EVERY PITCH.
MARK: I'M RIGHT 
THERE WITH YOU.
I'M NOT SURE 
THEY'RE NOT 
HAVING 
DIFFICULTY 
PICKING THE BALL
UP WHEN IT GOES 
UP IN THE AIR 
WITH THE 
SIGNAGE.
THE HOTEL LOOK 
OUT THERE IN 
CENTER, THE 
OUTDOOR MOTEL 
LOOK, THERE?
MATT: YEAH, 
THAT'S OFFICE 
SPACE UP THERE 
I'M TOLD.
MARK: YEAH.
MATT: SO IT'S 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
NOW, 0-2 
TONIGHT.
I KNOW THAT TROY
AIKMAN USED TO 
HAVE AN OFFICE 
OUT THERE, IT 
USED TO BE AN 
OFFICE 
DESTINATION 
ADDRESS, BUT I'M
NOT SURE THAT'S 
TRUE.
THIS IS A PRETTY
BALLPARK.
MARK: YES, IT 
IS.
MATT: BACK UP 
THE MIDDLE, A 
BASE HIT, ROD 
BARAJAS IS BEING
WAVED AROUND, 
MIKE CAMERON UP 
AND THROWING, IT
GETS AWAY FROM 
BARD AND YOUNG 
IS ON HIS WAY TO
THIRD.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] TIED 
AT 3 WITH THE 
GO-AHEAD RUN 90 
FEET AWAY AND 
STIM ONLY 1 OUT.
MARK: THAT'S THE
THING ABOUT THIS
TEXAS RANGERS 
TEAM, WE KNOW 
THEY CAN HIT AND
WE SURELY KNOW 
THAT A 2-RUN 
LEAD, 3-RETURN 
LEAD IS NEVER 
SAFE.
THEY CAN 
DEFINITELY SNAEK
UP ON YOU.
I'M GUESSING 
THAT'S GOING TO 
BE A SINGLE, 
SECOND ON THE 
THROW AND AN 
E-8, ALLOWING 
YOUNG TO GO TO 
THIRD BASE.
WE'LL HAVE TO 
SIT BACK FOR THE
OFFICIAL SCORE.
70 PITCHES FOR 
MIKE THOMPSON 
AND REALLY NOT 
THE BEST RATIO, 
BUT STILL A LOT 
OF WORK TO DO 
WITH THE 
GO-AHEAD RUN 90 
FEET AWAY.
MATT: SO NOW 
MARK TEIXEIRA IN
A SPOT WHERE A 
FLY BALL CAN 
RECLAIM THE 
RANGERS' LEAD.
HOW ABOUT A BASE
HIT?
YOUNG SCORES 
EASILY, AN 
R.B.I. KNOCK FOR
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
HIS SECOND BASE 
HIT OF THE GAME,
AND IT'S 4-3 
RANGERS.
MARK: JUST LIKE 
THAT, MATTY.
4 OUT OF 5 GUYS 
COMING TO THE 
PLATE HAVE 
GOTTEN KNOCKS IN
THIS TEXAS 5TH.
MATT: LOOKS LIKE
DARREN BALSLEY 
IS MAYBE A PITCH
OR TWO AWAY FROM
MAKING A VISIT.
HERE IS HANK 
BLALOCK, 2 FOR 
2, HIS FIRST 
BASE HIT HAVING 
SCORED A RUN.
NOBODY UP IN THE
SAN DIEGO 
BULLPEN.
BRIAN SIKORSKI 
IS JUST ABOUT TO
GWYNN A WARM-UP 
ASSIGNMENT NOW.
STILL A 
MANAGEABLE PITCH
COUNT FOR MIKE 
THOMPSON.
THAT'S NOT THE 
ISSUE.
IT'S AN 
EFFECTIVENESS 
PROBLEM.
FOUR OF THE FIVE
BATTERS HE FACED
HAVE REACHED 
SAFELY AND 3 OUT
OF 4 OF THOSE 
GUYS HAVE 
SCORED.
2-1 ON BLALOCK.
TEAM THAT'S 
HITTING OVER 300
IN THE MONTH OF 
JUNE.
THEY HAVE WON 3 
IN A ROW.
YOU DIDN'T 
EXPECT THE 
RANGERS TO 
SUDDENLY GO COLD
AT THE END OF A 
10-GAME HOME 
STAND.
MARK: NO.
HOW ABOUT THE 
LAST 10 GAMES 
FOR THE RANGERS,
MATTY?
THEY'RE HITTING 
.535 THE LAST 10
GAMES.
MATT: 
IRONICALLY, PLAY
BLA HAD BEEN ONE
OF THOSE NOT 
SWINGING THE BAT
EFFECTIVELY, 
ALTHOUGH HE IS 2
FOR 2 TONIGHT.
HE HAD BEEN 4 
FOR 17 COMING 
INTO THIS 
SERIES.
WHEN THEY CAN 
HAVE GUYS LIKE 
HANK BLALOCK AND
MARK TEIXEIRA 
NOT HITTING AND 
STILL WINNING, 
GETTING BACK 
INTO FIRST 
PLACE, THINGS 
ARE GOING GOOD.
THERE'S A FLY 
BALL TO CENTER, 
JOHNSON CALLING 
FOR IT.
2 GONE AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA STAYS 
AT FIRST.
SO NOW MARK 
DeROSA.
YOU KNOW, MARK 
DeROSA MIGHT BE 
THE BEST EXAMPLE
OF A GUY THAT 
HAS BENEFITED 
FROM A SPECIFIC 
HITTING COACH.
LONG-TIME 
HITTING 
INSTRUCTOR, 
HERE, RUDY 
JARAMILLO, WHO 
HAS MISSED SOME 
TIME, ACTUAL, 
BUT HE CREDITS 
RUDY JARAMILLO, 
AND HE'S NEVER 
HIT CLOSE TO THE
.333 HE'S 
HITTING NOW.
A BROKEN BAT AND
BASE HIT INTO 
RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE 
A PERMIT FOR 
THAT PIECE OF 
WOOD RIGHT NOW.
THAT IS REALLY A
SCARY BREAK.
MARK: THAT BAT 
DIED HAPPY, 
RIGHT?
BASE KNOCK.
RUDY JARAMILLO 
THE HITTING 
COACH WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH 
PROSTATE CANCER,
AND A LOT OF 
THESE HITTING 
COACHES HAVE THE
SAME APPROACH, 
THEY TRY TO GO 
THE OTHER WAY, 
THAT WAS A 
PERFECT EXAMPLE.
RUDY JARAMILLO 
WAS UNDER 
HITTING COACH 
HOUSTON, AND -- 
THERE'S RUDY.
MATT: YEAH, 
OZZIE GIAN PAID 
HIM A COMPLEMENT
EARL, HOW GOOD 
IS RUDY 
JARAMILLO?
HE GOT MARK 
DeROSA TO HIT 
.333, HE'S A 
GENIUS.
KIND OF A 
BACK-HANDED 
COMPLEMENT AT 
MARK DeROSA'S 
EXPENSE.
SO MENCH, WHO IS
HITLESS TONIGHT,
A BALL AND A 
STRIKE ON THE 
D.H., MENCH.
BUT AS WE KNOW, 
IT'S ABOUT THE 
PLAYERS, RIGHT?
MARK: 
ABSOLUTELY.
MATT: THINGS GO 
BAD, COACHES GET
THE BLAME.
THINGS GO WELL, 
PLAYERS GET THE 
CREDIT.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS 
FAIR, IT'S A 
REA. 
MARK: I KNOW 
THERE'S 2 OUTS, 
SO WE HAVE TO 
WAIT ON THIS 
PITCH.
I PUT IT IN THE 
SAME ANALOGY OF 
A TEACHER WHO 
HAS A CLASS.
THIS TEACHER 
PREPARES AND 
PREPARES AND 
PREPARES AND 
GIVES ALL THE 
INFORMATION TO 
THE STUDENTS.
THE TEST IS 
COMING UP THIS 
FRIDAY, HERE IS 
WHAT YOU NEED TO
KNOW, GOING OVER
THE PLANS, AND A
LOT OF CLASS IS 
FAILING, BUT THE
TEACHER IS 
TRYING TO 
PREPARE THESE 
STUDENTS TO DO 
THE BEST THEY 
CAN.
SOMETIMES IT'S 
THE STUDENTS.
MATT: EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE A 
MR. HAND GETS A 
JEFF SPICOLLI.
4-3 RANGERS.
S

MATT: STAY TUNED
AFTER THE GAME 
WITH 
APRIL 1-ON-1 
WITH JANE 
MITCHELL, ON 
MIKE CAMERON AND
ERIC YOUNG.
IT'S ALL COMING 
UP AFTER THE 
GAME TONIGHT.
VICENTE PADILLA 
WORKING WITH A 
LEAD, AS THE 
RANGERS GET 3 
AFTER VICENTE 
PADILLA GAVE UP 
2 IN HIS HALF OF
THE 5TH AND WITH
THAT 1-RUN LEAD 
HE MAKES BARD 
GROUND OUT, SO 1
GONE FOR VICENTE
PADILLA.
6, 7, 8 BATTERS 
IN THE SAN DIEGO
6TH.
MARTY FELDMAN UP
IN THE RANGER 
BULLPEN.
SCOTT FELDMAN UP
AND GETTING 
HIMSELF PREPARED
TONIGHT.
MARK: WHAT ARE 
THE CHANCES OF 
HIS NICKNAME 
BEING MARTY?
MATT: I DON'T 
KNOW THAT 
THEY'RE THAT 
GOOD, WHAT IS 
SCOTT FELDMAN, 
28, 29 YEARS 
OLD?
MARK: SO YOU'RE 
SAYING THE YOUNG
BREED OF OF 
PLAYERS MIGHT 
NOT KNOW WHO THE
ACTOR WAS?
MATT: I THINK IT
WOULD TAKE A 
COACH TO HANG 
THAT NAME ON 
HIM, OR A 
VETERAN GUY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
MANY GUYS COMING
UP FROM 
SAN FRANCISCO 
ARE GOING TO BE 
FAMILIAR WITH 
THE 
OPTICALLY-
CHALLENGED 
CHARACTER ACTOR.
GREENIE HAS HIS 
FIRST KNOCK OF 
THE BALL GAME, 
UPRIGHT FIELD.
NOW VINNY 
CASTILLA WITH A 
PAIR OF DOUBLES 
TONIGHT, HE HAS 
BEEN SAN DIEGO'S
TOUGHEST OUT AND
THAT WILL DRAW A
VISIT FROM BUCK 
SHOWALTER.
DID YOU SEE 
VICENTE PADILLA 
YA CRACK A SMILE
THERE?
THAT'S GOING TO 
BE IT.
A 1-OUT WARNING.
A PITCHING 
CHANGE IS 
BROUGHT TO YOU 
BY MOTOWORLD.
WE'LL BE BACK.
MATT: SO VICENTE
PADILLA IS GONE 
AFTER 5 AND 
1/3RD.
EVERY TIME I SEE
HIM WITH THE CAP
OFF THAT IS 
BORIS FROM THE 
ROCKY AND 
BULLWINKLE SHOW.
FELDMAN IS A 23 
YEAR OLD RIGHT 
HANDER, WHO HAS 
BEEN IMPRESSIVE 
AGAINST 
RIGHT-HANDED 
HITTING, WILL 
TRY TO SHUTDOWN 
CASTILLA HERE.
MARK: WE TALK 
ABOUT THE 
MATCH-UPS, AND 
THAT'S WHY BUCK 
WENT OUT TO GET 
THE RIGHTY.
RIGHTIES ARE 
ONLY HITTING 
VERY LITTLE OFF 
THE RIGHT 
HANDER.
VERY TOUGH TO 
PICK UP THAT 
BALL.
MATT: THE 
RANGERS BULLPEN 
HAS BEEN VERY 
GOOD AS A GROUP 
IN NOT ALLOWING 
INHERITED 
BATTERS TO CROSS
THE PLATE.
ONLY 25% OF 
TWHOES INHERITED
HAVE COME AROUND
TO SCORE.
THAT'S THE 
LOWEST 
PERCENTAGE AMONG
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
BULLPENS.
GREENE WITH A 
COMFORTABLE LEAD
OFF FIRST AND 
THE PITCH MISSES
UP TO VINNY, 
1-1.
IN OTHER 
CATEGORIES, WHEN
YOU AVERAGE OUT 
THEIR RANKINGS, 
THEY RANK AROUND
THE MIDDLE OF 
THE PACK IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
CASTILLA SENDS A
FLY BALL TO 
RIGHT CENTER, 
TOO HIGH TO DO 
ANY DAMAGE THIS 
TIME.
MARK DeROSA IS 
UNDER IT, AND 
THAT'S THE FIRST
TIME VINNY HAS 
BEEN RETIRED 
TONIGHT.
MARK: YOU CAN 
SEE WHY HE HAS 
SUCH GREAT 
NUMBERS AGAINST 
RIGHTIES, THE 
DIFFERENT ANGLE,
IT'S NOT A 
SIDEARMER THAT 
IS THROWING 70, 
75 
MILE-PER-HOUR, 
HE'S GETTING UP 
THERE IN THE 
UPPER
UPPER 80'S, AND 
HE HAS A LOT ON 
THAT SINKER HE 
THROWS.
MATT: SO NOW BEN
JOHNSON WITH A 
RUNNER ABOARD 
AND 2 GONE.
BENNY HAS HAD 
RUNNERS ABOARD 
IN ALL OF HIS 
AT-BATS, SO FAR 
AND HE TAKES A 
STRIKE.
THIS HAS TO BE 
ANOTHER TOUGH 
SPOT FOR BEN IN 
THAT HE KNOWS 
WHEN DAVE 
ROBERTS COMES 
BACK, HE WILL BE
REACTIVATED, AND
THERE'S GOING TO
BE ANOTHER MOVE,
AND BEN'S BEST 
SHOT AT STICKING
AROUND IS TO 
PLAY OUT OF HIS 
TREE FOR THE 
NEXT TWO WEEKS 
OR SO UNTIL DAVE
RETURNS AND THAT
CAN LEAD TO ALL 
KINDS OF 
ADDITIONAL 
PRESSURES.
MARK: HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO
REALLY GO OFF, 
HIT THE BALL OUT
OF THE BALLPARK,
COME UP WITH 
HUGE HITS, HIT 
FOR HIGH 
AVERAGE, DRIVE 
GUYS IN, IN 
ORDER TO MAKE A 
TOUGH DECISION 
WHEN IT COMES TO
MAKING ROSTER 
MOVES WHEN THE 
DOCTOR COMES 
BACK.
MATT: A CHANCE 
TO TALK TO BEN 
BEFORE THE GAME 
TODAY, HE KNOWS 
HE HAS TO GO OUT
THERE AND PLAY 
AS WELL AS HE 
CAN.
HE'S NOT GOING 
TO GET CAUGHT UP
IN GOING 4 FOR 5
EVERY NIGHT.
LEFT CENTER 
FIELD, THAT'S 
GOING TO SCORE A
RUN AS GREENE IS
AROUND THIRD.
JOHNSON IS INTO 
SECOND WITH AN 
R.B.I. DOUBLE TO
TIE US AT 4.
ON QUE, BENNY 
DELIVERS.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
BEN WENT DOWN 
AND GOT THIS 
PITCH, ALSO.
I MEAN, IT'S 
OUTER HALF, YOU 
CAN SEE THE 
UPPER HALF OF 
THE BODY GETS 
IT, AND HE'S 
TRYING TO GET 
INSURANCE OFF 
THE GEICO SIGN.
MATT: HE IS ONE 
OF THE RAW, AT 
TIMES SEEMINGLY 
UNREFINED 
TALENTS THAT THE
PADRES HAVE IN 
THEIR MINOR 
LEAGUE SYSTEM 
THAT AND YOU I 
WERE TALKING TO 
BOCH ABOUT 
YESTERDAY.
I'M A BIG FAN, I
KNOW YOU FEEL 
THE SAME WAY.
I LOVE WHAT HE 
BRINGS TO THE 
CLUB. HE HAS A 
LOT OF TOOLS.
HE HITS FOR 
POWER, CAN RUN, 
AND NOW MIKE 
CAMERON WITH A 
CHANCE TO 
REDELIVER A SAN 
DIEGO LEAD.
THE LEAD HAS 
ALREADY CHANGED 
HANDS TWICE 
TONIGHT.
WE'RE BACK TO 
EVEN, 4 APIECE.
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S BETTER?
BEN JOHNSON 
HITTING OFF 
FELDMAN WITH THE
GOOD NUMBERS 
HE'S HAD OFF 
RIGHTIES, SO HE 
GOT OFF THAT 
PITCH EXAMINE 
SQUARED UP ON IT
NICELY.
>> 1-1 FROM 
FELDMAN TO 
CAMERON.
THERE'S A DRIVE 
INTO THE 
OPPOSITE FIELD, 
THAT BALL HAS A 
CHANCE, MARK 
DeROSA BACK, HE 
LOOKS UP AND
IT'S GONE!
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON WAS IN 
EGYPT LAND.
CAMERON'S HOUSE 
IS LIKE A 
MUSEUM, VERY 
COLD AND YOU 
CAN'T TOUCH 
ANYTHING.
MIKE'S SECOND OF
THE TRIP, 5TH OF
THE YEAR, FRIARS
BACK ON TOP BY 
2.
MARK: OH, THAT 
BALL GOES RIGHT 
OVER THE HEART 
OF THE PLATE AND
MIKE, WATCH HIM 
STAY INSIDE THE 
BASEBALL NICELY.
HOW CLOSE?
WELL OUT OF THE 
REACH OF THE 
MARK DeROSA.
MATT: SO NOW 
GEOFF BLUM -- 
MARK: THE 
RIGHTIES JUST 
SEEM TO -- 
FELDMAN OUT 
THERE, YOU GOT 
YOUR .163 
BATTING AVERAGE.
MATT: COUPLE OF 
HOME RUNS FOR 
SAN DIEGO 
TONIGHT.
3 DOUBLES IN THE
ATTACK.
9 HITS APIECE, 
6-4 SAN DIEGO 
LEADS.
MARK: NICE SWING
BY CAMERON.
SWINGING THE BAT
WELL IN ANAHEIM.
>> THIS 
INTERLEAGUE 
THING AIN'T SUCH
A BAD THING.
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU A 
ALONG.
YOU KNOW, I'M A 
BIG PROPONENT OF
INTERLEAGUE PLAY
WHEN THE PADRES 
WIN.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: A SWING 
AND A MISS BY 
BLUM.
SAN DIEGO DOES 
MORE DAMAGE.
THEY HANG 3 IN 
THE 6TH.
AN R.B.I. DOUBLE
BY JOHNSON AND A
MATT: 6-4 
PADRES.
SAN DIEGO BACK 
ON TOP.
A REMINDER THAT 
COCA-COLA FAMILY
AND FRIENDS WEEK
ENDS ARE HERE.
LOG ONTO 
PADRES.COM AND 
GET 4 UPPER DECK
TICKETS AND 4 
HOT DOGS, AND 4 
COKES FOR ONLY 
$50.
WE TURN TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
6TH, AND A 
PITCHING CHANGE 
FOR SAN DIEGO, 
PADRES GO TO THE
BULLPEN FOR 
BRIAN SIKORSKI.
MARK: BRIAN 
SIKORSKI AGAINST
LEFT HANDERS, WE
HAVE SOME DUE UP
HERE, THEY ARE 
HITLESS 0-6 
AGAINST HIM, AND
WE KNOW HOW 
IMPORTANT IT IS 
TO GET THAT 
FIRST BATTER IN 
THE INNING.
MATT: FOR BRIAN 
SIKORSKI, THIS 
WILL BE HIS 
FIRST APPEARANCE
ON THE TRIP.
HE LAST WORKED 
AGAINST THE 
DODGERS, ON 
THURSDAY.
WE TALKED ABOUT 
IT IN ANAHEIM, 
WHERE 
OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR BRIAN TO GET
IN THE BALL GAME
HAVE BEEN 
SCARCE.
HE WILL BE 
LEANED ON HERE 
IN A BIG SPOT, 
NOT ONLY IN 
TERMS OF THE 
SCORE, TRYING TO
HOLD A 2-RUN 
LEAD BUT BRIAN 
SIKORSKI HAS 
ROOTS HERE IN AR
LINK TOVENLT HE 
BROKE INTO THE 
BIG LEAGUES WITH
THE RANGERS IN 
2000 AND, IN 
FACT, UNTIL SAN 
DIEGO CALLED HIM
UP THIS YEAR, 
HIS 10 
APPEARANCES WITH
THE BIG LEAGUE 
RANGERS IN 2000,
HIS ONLY MAJOR 
LEAGUE 
EXPERIENCE IN 
HIS 11-YEAR 
CAREER.
2 BALLS AND 2 
STRIKES TO 
BRIAN, RATHER TO
BRAD WILKERSON 
FROM BRIAN 
SIKORSKI.
AND A FULL COUNT
NOW, 3-2.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
BRIAN MAYBE A 
LITTLE STRONG 
OUT THERE, YOU 
KNOW?
SOMETIMES GUYS 
WHEN THEY'RE 
FEELING A LITTLE
FROGGY AND A 
LITTLE STRONG 
THEY'LL 
OVERTHROW A 
LITTLE BIT.
HE HAS 93, 94 ON
THAT FASTBALL.
THAT'S A PERFECT
EXAMPLE THAT HE 
HAS THE GOOD 
FASTBALL.
HE TRIES TO BURY
IS IN BRAD 
WILKERSON, BUT 
HE HIT THAT ONE,
FOULED IT OFF 
THE HANDLE.
HE WANTS TO GO 
AWAY, BUT HE 
JERKS IT ACROSS 
HIS BODY AND 
BRAD WILKERSON 
HAVING A TOUGH 
TIME CATCHING 
UP.
MATT: FOULED IS 
BACK AND IT'S 
3-2.
SAME STARTS ON 
TOMORROW TONIGHT
FOR GAME 2 OF 
THE SERIES.
JOIN US TOMORROW
AT 5:45, WE'LL 
BE WITH YOU FOR 
GAME 2 COVERAGE,
A FANTASTIC 
PITCHING 
MATCH-UP 
TOMORROW NIGHT.
BRAD WILKERSON 
LINES INTO RIGHT
FIELD, AND IT 
BOUNDS IN THE 
CORNER, GILES 
BRINGS IT IN 
WITH A BARE 
HAND, BUT BRAD 
WILKERSON ON THE
8TH PITCH OF THE
AT-BAT, DOUBLES 
INTO THE RIGHT 
FIELD CORNER TO 
LEAD THINGS OFF 
IN THE 6TH.
THIS IS EXACTLY 
HOW THE BOTTOM 
OF THE 5TH 
INNING STARTED 
FOR THE RANGERS.
MARK: YEAH, 
THAT'S THE FIRST
HIT GIVEN UP TO 
A LEFTY THIS 
YEAR BY BRIAN 
SIKORSKI.
SO THETHE EX-EXPOE,
FORMER NATIONAL 
LEAGUE PLAYER IS
ABOARD.
SAN DIEGO SCORED
TWICE IN THE 5TH
TO TAKE THE 
LEAD.
AND THEN IN THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
INNING, THE 
RANGERS OPENED 
WITH A DOUBLE 
AND
RACK AND RACKED 
3 TO CLAIM THE 
LEAD.
AND BRIAN 
SIKORSKI HERE IN
THE 6TH.
MARK: I 
MENTIONED A 
HIGH, 
FASTBALL-HITTING
TEAM AND IAN 
KINSLER WAS ALL 
OVER THAT ONE, 
AND HE LIKES 
THAT PITCH UP.
MATT: REMEMBER 
WHEN YOU AND I 
WERE ON THE 
FIELD BEFORE THE
GAME THIS 
AFTERNOON, 2:30,
3:00 WE WERE 
DOWN THERE FOR 
RANGER B.P., AND
YOU MADE THE 
COMMENT, "MAN, 
IS THIS A BIG 
BALLPARK."
AND IT IS BIG.
IT LOOKS BIG, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
FA
FASAD, AND IT 
PLAYS LIKE A 
BAND BOX.
MARK: UH-HUH.
MATT: BRIAN 
SIKORSKI 2 BALLS
AND A STRIKE TO 
KINSLER, AND 
BRIAN HAVING TO 
WORK DEEP IN THE
COUNT AGAIN.
FULL TO 
WILKERSON BEFORE
HE HIT THE 
DOUBLE.
AND QUICKLY 
ADKINS IS UP IN 
THE BULLPEN.
HE LOSES HIM ON 
BALL 4.
SO KINSLER IS 
ABOARD.
WE'LL SEE HOW 
LONG THE LEASH 
IS FOR BRIAN, 
HERE.
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND, 
NOBODY OUT. 
MARK: THE RUNNER
AT SECOND BASE 
AND NOW A FORCE 
AT ANY BASE, 
BARD MAY BE 
GOING OVER THE 
SCOUTING REPORT 
WITH VINNY, 
MAYBE A BUNT 
PLAY, WHO KNOWS?
MATT: THAT'S 
GOING TO BE IT.
BARD WAS BUYING 
TIME, 
APPARENTLY, FOR 
JOHN ADKINS.
LEAD-OFF DOUBLE 
AND A BASE ON 
BALLS AND 
QUICKLY THE 
PADRES GO BACK 
TO THE BULLPEN, 
A PITCHING 
CHANGE FOR SAN 
DIEGO.
IT WILL BE UP TO
ADD KINS TO WORK
DEEP AND TRY TO 
STRAND A COUPLE 
OF RERZ WITH 
NOBODY OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT 
BACK.
MATT: AFTER A 
SHORT RELEASE BY
BRIAN SIKORSKI, 
THE PADRES TURN 
TO RIGHT HANDER 
JOHN ADKINS HERE
IN THE BOTTOM 
HALF OF THE 
INNING AND 
IRONICALLY IT 
WAS ADKINS THAT 
HAD THE SHORT 
STINT, IT CAME 
IN ANAHEIM AND 
HE WAS GIVEN THE
QUICK HOOK, AND 
IT'S ADKINS 
TRYING TO 
CLEANUP AFTER A 
QUICK HOOK HERE.
MARK: IT'S GOING
TO BE A TOUGH 
JOB HERE.
YOU HAVE TO TRY 
TO TURN THE 
PAGE, LIKE A 
CLOSER WHO MAYBE
BLOWS A SAVE, 
LIKE TREVOR 
HOFFMAN, YOU GO 
OUT THERE AND 
ERASE T. THAT'S 
ONE OF THE 
QUALITIES THAT 
MAKES A SET-UP 
GUY, A MIDDLE 
RELIEVER. 
FORGET ABOUT THE
LAST OUTING, AND
COME BACK AND DO
WELL HERE.
MATT: THE 
RANGERS HAVE HIT
INTO TWO DOUBLE 
PLAYS.
BUNTING HERE 
THERE WILL BE NO
DOUBLE PLAY AND 
THE SACRIFICE 
WORKS.
GOOD EXECUTION 
BY ROD BARAJAS 
ON SOMETHING OF 
A NO-BRAINER 
CALL FROM THE 
DUGOUT, AND 
THERE ARE 
RUNNERS AT 
SECOND AND THIRD
WITH 1 MAN OUT. 
MARK: SO THE 
5TH, 5TH 
SACRIFICE HIT 
THIS YEAR FOR 
ROD BARAJAS, AND
HE DOES A NICE 
JOB BRINGING 
THOSE WRERS 
AROUND.
MATT: GARY 
MATTHEWS, JUNIOR
WITH A BASE ON 
BALLS TONIGHT.
HE STARTED PLAY 
WITH 30 
EXTRA-BASE HITS.
AGAIN, HE'S BEEN
QUIET NIGHT.
ADKINS STARTS 
HIM WITH A 
FASTBALL FOR A 
STRIKE.
LET ME ASK YOU 
THIS, FORMER BIG
LEAGUE HURLER: 
OF ALL THE 
PITCHES THAT 
ADKINS THROWS, 
AND AS 1, A GOOD
2-SEAM AND 
4-SEAM 
FASTBALL -- 
FIRST THE PITCH 
HOME TO GARY 
MATTHEWS THAT 
MISSES.
DOES THE 
SITUATION HERE 
DICTATE HOW HE 
USES THE 
FASTBALLS?
MARK: I THINK 
FIRST OF ALL, 
ADKINS HAS TWO 
GOOD QUALITY 
FASTBALLS IN THE
4-SEAMER AND THE
2-SEAMER, AND IF
I LOOK AT THOSE 
EARL ON I WOULD 
SAY GROUNDER, 
BUT THE INFIELD 
IS PLAYING BACK.
GO FOR THE 
4-SEAMER IF YOU 
WANT THE 
PUNCH-OUT. I 
SEE WHERE YOU'RE
GOING, THOUGH, 
YOU CAN USE 
THOSE TO YOUR 
ADVANTAGE, YES, 
EARL ON IF YOU 
WANT A GROUND 
BALL YOU USE THE
TWO-SEAMER.
YOU GET THE 
QUICK OUT AND 
YOU CAN THROW 
THE 4-SEAMER.
MATT: PERHAPS 
NOT IDEAL TO GO 
OVER THE 
DIFFERENCES BUT 
IF THERE IS A 
RUNNER AT FIRST 
OR SECOND YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR THAT
GROUND BALL AND 
THE DOUBLE PLAY.
NICK THE GROUND 
BALL SCORES THE 
RUN.
IAN KINSLER 
ADVANCED TO 
THIRD.
AND NOW IT'S 
YOUNG.
MARK: WITH THE 
WAY THE THINGS 
ARE GOING AND 
THE RUNS THE 
PADRES HAVE 
SCORED, BOCH 
LIKES TO PLAY 
THE INFIELD BACK
BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO GET THE 
OUT.
MATT: IS THIS A 
SWING OF A GUY 
THAT'S WORRIED 
ABOUT HIS OPS?
MARK: [CHUCKLES]
HANGING BREAKING
BALL, I WANT TO 
SEE A GUY TAKE A
HACK LIKE THAT.
MATT: YOUNG 
FLIES TO RIGHT.
GOOD WORK BY 
JOHN ADKINS AS 
THE RANGERS 
SCORE 1.
WE HAVE A 1-RUN 
BALL GAME.
MATT: IT'S KIDS 
DAY WHAT THE 
PADRES TAKE ON 
THE MARINERS.
KIDS 14 AND 
YOUNGER RECEIVE 
THE GIVE AWAY 
ITEM OF THE 
YEAR, MUDCAT, A 
PADRES MR. 
MR. POTATO HEAD,
CALL 
877-PADRES-TIX, 
OR PADRES.COM.
MARK: YOU BET, 
CHILDHOOD MEMORY
THERE, BUDDY.
MATT: BRYAN 
COREY HERE FOR 
THE RANGERS.
MARK: BRYAN 
COREY TRYING TO 
IRON SOME THINGS
OUT.
I MENTIONED 
PITCHERS TURNING
THE PAGE AND 
FORGETTING ABOUT
IT, AND FROM THE
PADRES' POINT OF
VIEW, HERE IS A 
GUY WHO HAS BEEN
KNOCKED AROUND 
LATELY.
MATT: BRYAN 
COREY HAS 
CERTAINLY HAD AN
UNUSUAL ROUTE TO
GET BACK TO THE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
LEVEL.
GILES WILL LEAD 
OFF AGAINST HIM 
HERE IN THE 7TH.
THIS YEAR ALONE 
COREY HAS 
PITCHED AT 3 
LEVELS, 
INCLUDING MAJOR 
LEAGUE 
ARLINGTON.
TIME AT 
DOUBLE-AFRIDOUBLE-A 
FRISCO AND IN 
OKLAHOMA.
HE MADE HIS 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
DEBUT HERE 
IN 1998.
GILES FOULS THAT
OFF, GLER-2.
COREY NOT AS 
EXPERIENCED AS 
SCOTT FELDMAN, 
WHO WORKED LAST 
INNING, BUT 
STILL A GUY WHO 
HASN'T BEEN UP 
HERE IN QUITE 
SOME TIME AND 
HERE IS WHERE 
YOU FIND THE 
GREEN NATURE OF 
THE BULLPEN, A 
LOT OF YOUNG 
GUYS.
THAT'S GROANED 
OUT TO YOUNG, 1 
AWAY.
SO NOW MIKE 
PIAZZA, HE HAS 
COME THROUGH 
TONIGHT WITH A 
COUPLE OF RUNS 
BATTED IN 
EXAMINE THAT 
MERITS THE 
QUESTION, HOW 
HAS THE NATIONAL
FAIRED WITH THE 
D.H. IN PLAY, 
AND THE ANSWER 
IS, PRETTY 
EVENLY, A.L. 
BENEFITS FROM 
THE D.H. ALL 
YEAR LONG, OF 
COURSE.
AND IT LOOKS
PRETTY 
COMPARABLE.
MARK: EXCEPT FOR
THE SLUGGING 
PERCENTAGE, 
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MATT: MAY BE OF 
INTEREST FOR 
FANS TO KNOW 
THAT BEFORE THE 
GAME TONIGHT, 
COMING INTO THE 
START, MIKE 
PIAZZA'S -- 
RATHER THE D.H.,
THE PADRES' D.H.
POSITION, 
AVERAGING .208, 
NOT A WHOLE LOT 
OF PRODUCTIVITY,
THAT'S THE 5TH 
BEST IN THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
IN INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY.
THAT'S JUST A 
GUY GETTING HOT.
THAT'S ONE GUY.
YOU KNOW, PIAZZA
HAS BEEN THE 
D.H. FOR THE 
MOST PART IN 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY
FOR SAN DIEGO.
HE WAS 2 FOR 12 
IN ANAHEIM.
3 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE TO MIKE.
MARK: THIS IS 
WHERE IT GETS 
DANGEROUS.
ANY HITTER IN 
THIS BALLPARK, 
3-1, YOU LOOK 
FOR THE 
FASTBALL, TRY TO
ADD ONTO THAT 
6-5 LEAD.
OH, BREAKING 
BALL.
MATT: MISSED 
WITH IT.
AND PIAZZA IS 
ABOARD.
SEE IF MIKE IS 
ALLOWED TO STAY 
OUT THERE OR IF 
THEY WILL PUT A 
PINCH-RUNNER ON.
THE WAY RUNS ARE
SCORED IN THIS 
BALLPARK, I 
WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IN 
BOCH IS 
THINKING, I'M 
GOING TO LET 
MIKE RUN HERE 
AND GET A 5TH 
AT-BAT OUT OF 
HIM.
MARK: YEAH, HE 
DIDN'T RUN THE 
BASES THE FIRST 
TWO TIMES UP.
HE GROUNDED OUT 
AND LINED OUT.
MATT: ALL THE 
MANAGERS AT HOME
ARE THINKING 
WHAT THEY WOULD 
DO IN THIS SPOT,
THAT'S GOOD 
FODDER FOR THE 
WATER COOLER.
MARK: I WOULD 
LEAVE HIM IN 
THERE, 
ABSOLUTELY.
SO WOULD YOU, 
RIGHT?
MATT: YEAH.
THEN THIS IS THE
THING.
WHEN YOU 
CRITICIZE AND 
WHEN -- HERE IS 
GONZALEZ LINING 
IT TO LEFT, BASE
HIT, RUNNERS AT 
FIRST AND SECOND
NOW WITH ONE 
GONE.
WHEN YOU MAKE AN
ARGUMENT AS A 
FAN, AS A 
WRITER, AS A 
BROADCASTER, AS 
A TALK SHOW 
HOST, AS THEY SO
OFTEN LIKE TO 
DO, YOU MAKE A 
CRITICISM AND 
YOU HAVE TO 
THINK ABOUT THE 
WHOLE SITUATION.
IF THE 
MANAGER -- IF 
BUCK SHOWALTER 
DECIDES TO BUNT 
OR NOT BUNT, 
PINCH-HIT OR NOT
PINCH-HIT, DO 
YOU THINK HE'S 
MORE FAMILIAR 
WITH WHAT HE HAS
THAN THE NEXT 
GUY?
DO YOU THINK HE 
KNOWS MORE THAN 
WHAT WE KNOW?
THE ANSWER IS, 
OF COURSE.
NOW WITH RUNNERS
AT FIRST AND 
SECOND, BOCH 
WILL GO AHEAD 
AND REMOVE 
PIAZZA FOR A 
PINCH-RUNNER, 
AND MARK 
BELLHORN WILL 
RUN.
SO BARD THE 
BATTER WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND, 1 
AWAY.
GETS THE BULLPEN
HOT FOR THE 
RANGERS, AGAIN.
TEXAS HAS 
ANOTHER RIGHT 
HANDER DOWN 
THERE THROWING, 
FIRST FELDMAN, 
NOW COREY.
RICK BAUER UP IN
THE BULLPEN.
BY THE WAY, DO 
YOU THINK 
WHEN -- JOSH IS 
WORKING ON A 
LITTLE INGROWN 
BEARD HERE.
YOU THINK WHEN 
JOSH CEASE RICK 
BAUER UP IN THE 
BULLPEN HE GETS 
THE SHAKES, 
THINKING OF 
HANK?
JOSH, THE RADIO 
VOICE OF THE SAN
DIEGO CHARGERS, 
AND TV VOICE OF 
THE TEXAS 
RANGERS DURING 
THE SUMMER.
MARK: BARD IS 
HURTING DOWN 
THERE.
IT'S BEEN A 
WHILE.
LET'S TAKE A 
LOOK.
WHAT'S THE 
PITCH?
FASTBALL.
OH, WAS THAT OFF
HIS BACK ANKLE?
YOU DON'T SEE 
THAT TOO MUCH, 
DO YOU?
THE BACK ANKLE.
MATT: NO.
AT FIRST I 
THOUGHT HE 
FOULED THE PITCH
INTO HIS FRONT 
FOOT, BUT YOU'RE
RIGHT, IT WAS 
THE BACK ANKLE 
THAT TOOK THE 
BRUNT OF THAT 
SWING.
AND THEY'RE 
GIVING JOSH ALL 
THE TIME HE 
NEEDS TO GET THE
WHEEL RIGHT.
SO NOTHING AND 1
IT IS TO JOSH 
BARD WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND.
BELLHORN AT 
SECOND, GONZALEZ
AT FIRST.
BIG SWING AND A 
MISS.
HE WANTED TO 
TEST THAT WHEEL 
IMMEDIATELY.
GREENE NEXT AS 
COREY TAKES TIME
BETWEEN PITCHES 
NOW.
1-RUN BALL GAME,
TOP OF THE 7TH, 
6-5 SAN DIEGO.
GOT 'EM.
IT MERITS 
WATCHING BARD 
WALK BACK TO THE
DUGOUT.
MARK: HE IS 
WALKING SLOWLY 
BACK TO THAT 
DUGOUT.
MATT: SO NOW 
KHALIL GREENE 
WITH 2 GONE.
STILL 2 RUNNERS 
ABOARD, GREENIE 
SINGLED AND 
SCORED IN THE 
6TH.
POPPED HIM UP.
OUT FROM SECOND 
BASE IS IAN 
KINSLER, HE 
YIELDS TO GARY 
MATTHEWS AND THE
2 BASE RUNNERS 
ARE LEFT 
STRANDED.
MATT: COME OUT 
TO PETCO PARK 
EARLY FOR 
SATURDAY'S GAME,
IT'S FEAST STA 
COL LOS PADRES, 
TICKETS START AT
$5, VISIT 
PADRES.COM OR 
CALL 
877-FRIAR-TIX.
PITCHING CHANGE 
FOR CHANGE FOR 
SAN DIEGO, 
EMBREE GETS THE 
7TH.
MARK: HE STRUCK 
OUT 2 ANGLES IN 
ANAHEIM, IN 
ORANGE COUNTY.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: EMBREE 
FACES MARK 
TEIXEIRA, HANK 
BLALOCK AND MARK
DeROSA, HERE.
SO MARK TEIXEIRA
TURNED AROUND 
FROM THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE 
PLATE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
HAS BEEN EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY THIS
YEAR FROM BOTH 
SIDES OF THE 
PLATE.
THOUGH THE 
OVERALL NUMBERS 
ARE DOWN, HE HAS
BEEN EVEN 
BETWEEN THE 
RIGHT AND LEFT 
SIDE.
3 HOME RUNS FROM
EACH SIDE OF THE
PLATE, FAR MORE 
AT-BATS AS A 
LEFT-HANDED 
HITTER THIS 
YEAR.
1 RUN LEAD FOR 
SAN DIEGO, A BIG
SWING AND A 
MISS.
MARK: A LOT OF 
TIMES I LOOK AT 
HITTERS WHEN 
THEY'RE STANDING
IN THE BOX, AND 
IT LOOKS LIKE 
PERFECT CENTER 
FIELD ANGLE THAT
MARK TEIXEIRA 
WITH A SLIGHTLY 
OPEN STANCE IS 
SLIGHTLY OFF THE
PLATE, SO THAT 
TELLS ME THESE 
GUYS LIKE TO 
DIVE TO COVER 
THE OUTSIDE PART
OF THE PLATE.
REMEMBER A GUY 
BY THE NAME OF 
TIM WALLACH AND 
WOULD DIVE FOR 
THE BALL.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS AND 
STRIKEOUT 
RECORDED FOR EM 
COMBREE AS HIS 
FIRST PIECE OF 
BUSINESS 
TONIGHT, AND NOW
HANK BLALOCK.
I LIKE THAT 
MOVE, BRINGING 
EMBREE IN FOR 
THE 7TH, BECAUSE
YOU TURNAROUND 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
AND BAT HIM FROM
THE SIDE OF THE 
PLATE WHERE HE 
HAS BEEN 
TRADITIONALLY 
LESS LIKELY TO 
BEAT YOU WITH 
THE LONG BALL.
NOW LEFTY/LEFTY 
MATCH-UP FOR 
HANK BLALOCK, 
WHO TAKES A 
STRIKE.
6 RUNS ON 10 
HITS FOR SAN 
DIEGO, 5 RUNS ON
10 HITS FOR THE 
HOME STANDING 
RANGERS TONIGHT.
0-2.
BLALOCK STARTED 
OUT 2 FOR 2 WITH
AN R.B.I. 
AGAINST THE 
STARTER, MIKE 
THOMPSON.
BY THE WAY, IT 
IS THOMPSON WHO 
IS THE PITCHER 
OF RECORD 
TONHT.
MIKE HOPING FOR 
HIS FIRST WIN 
SINCE HIS SECOND
START OF THE 
YEAR.
MARK: THAT'S WHY
I WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE THE PADRES 
ADD ON A LITTLE 
BIT AND GET SOME
BREATHING ROOM 
AS YOU GO INTO 
THE 7TH, 8TH AND
9TH INNING, KEEP
THAT "W" IN 
FRONT OF 
THOMPSON'S NAME.
MATT: IF YOU'RE 
TUNING US IN 
LATE, A WIN 
TONIGHT FOR SAN 
DIEGO WOULD BE 
BRUCE BOCHY'S 
900TH CAREER.
1-2 NOW.
IF EVER THERE 
WAS A GUY THAT 
DIDN'T GET ALL 
CAUGHT UP IN 
STATS AND 
NUMBERS, IT'S 
BOCH.
BUT I THINK 900 
IS SOMETHING 
THAT EVEN HE'S 
GOING TO HAVE TO
FEEL PRETTY GOOD
B. 
MARK: OH, YEAH.
THINK OF HOW 
MANY GAMES THAT 
IS, MY GOODNESS.
>> OUT OF THE 
STRETCH, THE 
1-2.
2 BALLS AND 2 
STRIKES.
EVEN WHEN THINGS
WERE LEAN, IN 
THE IMMEDIATE 
POST- 1998 
GLORY, AND THE 
PADRES 
STRUGGLED, 
'9090, 2000, 
2002, 2003, 
THOSE WEREN'T 
PARTICULARLY 
GOOD TEAMS. 
LET'S CALL IT 
FOR WHAT IT WAS.
AND A LOT OF 
CREDIT IS THE TO
BE GIVEN TO A 
MANAGER THAT'S 
ABLE TO COACH 
VICTORIES OUT OF
TEAMS LIKE 
THOSE.
THE MANAGER OF 
THE YEAR AWARD, 
SEEMS LIKE, YOU 
CAN WRITE IT IN 
TO THE MANAGER 
WHO FINISHES THE
SEASON WITH THE 
BEST RECORD.
MARK: I THINK 
THAT'S -- 
MATT: OR WHO HAS
THE BIG PAYROLL 
AND THERE ARE A 
LOT OF MANAGERS 
WHO WILL TELL 
YOU THEIR BEST 
MANAGING JOB 
WASN'T WHEN THEY
WON THE DIVISION
IT WAS WHEN THEY
HAD TO COME OUT 
WITH A MORE 
DIFFICULT TEAM 
AND WIN.
MARK: I THINK 
THERE ARE TEAMS 
THAT COULD 
FINISHED SECOND 
AND THIRD PLACE 
THAT COULD BE 
MERITED MANAGER 
OF THE YEAR.
MATT: I AGREE.
CAR DEALERSHIP 
OF THE YEAR GOES
TO MOSSY NISSAN,
SIX LOCATIONS IN
SAN DIEGO 
COUNTY, 
INCLUDING POWAY,
OCEANSIDE, AND 
IF YOU GO BY 
NATIONAL CITY, 
TELL TIM HOWELL 
HELLO, TELL HIM 
THAT CHANNEL 4 
SENT YOU.
MOSSY KNEE KAUN.
NISSAN.


MATT: THE NEPHEW
OF -- MARK 
DeROSA HAS 
SINGLED TWICE 
TONIGHT AND 
GROUNDED INTO A 
FIELDER'S CHOICE
PLAY.
IF YOU CAN KEEP 
THINGS CLEAN 
FROM HERE ON 
OUT, THIS IS THE
LAST TIME THE 
PADRES ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH THE MARK 
TEIXEIRA AND THE
BLALOCKS OF THE 
WORLD.
2 BALLS, NO 
STRIKES TO MARK 
DeROSA.
MARK: YOU LOOK 
AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE ORDER FOR 
TEXAS, BRAD 
WILKERSON, IAN 
KINSLER, AND ROD
BARAJAS, EACH OF
THEM EXTRA BASES
TONIGHT AND 
THEY'VE EACH 
SCORED.
MATT: 3 BALLS, 
NO STRIKES TO 
MARK DeROSA.
KEVIN MENCH 
WAITING ON DECK 
FOR THE RANGERS.
MILLWOOD AND 
YOUNG JOIN US 
TOMORROW NIGHT 
FOR THAT 
PITCHING 
MATCH-UP.
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
RETURN TO 
ARLINGTON.
3 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE TO MARK 
DeROSA.
2 OUT, BASES 
EMPTY, SAN DIEGO
UP A RUN HERE IN
THE 7TH.
CLOSE GAMES 
LATE, ALWAYS A 
POSSIBILITY 
WE'LL SEE PART 
OF THE 
COMPENSATION FOR
CHRIS YOUNG, A 
POPULAR FRIAR 
FOR 2 YEARS, 
MORANDINI 
AKI.
MARK: AND 
HOPEFULLY WE 
WON'T HEAR 
"HELLS BELLS" 
TONIGHT.
THEY PLAY THE 
SAME THING FOR 
HIM AS HE COMES 
IN AS WE DO FOR 
TREVOR.
MATT: THAT WILL 
BE ALL FOR EM 
COMBREE, THE 
PODS ARE GOING 
TO GO TO SCOTT 
LINEBRINK WITH 
THAT TYING RUN 
ON BASE LATE.
THE 4TH RELIEVER
ON HIS WAY INTO 
THE CONTEST FOR 
SAN DIEGO.
PITCHING CHANGE,
A FRESH BULLPEN 
BEING USED 
DEEPLY TONIGHT.
BE BACK.
MATT: AFTER THE 
2-OUT BASE HIT, 
THE PADRES GO TO
THE BULLPEN ONCE
MORE AND IT WILL
BE SCOTT 
LINEBRINK TO 
LOOK FOR THE 
FINAL OUT HERE 
IN THE LAST OF 
THE 7TH.
INCH THE OTHER 
THING THE 
RANGERS ARE 
GOING TO HAVE TO
DO IS TURN UP 
THE DIAL, AFTER 
FACING MIKE 
THOMPSON WHO 
STARTED FOR THE 
PADRES.
SCOTTY WITH A 
GOOD FASTBALL, 
94, 95 
MILE-PER-HOUR.
MATT: MENCH IS 
HITLESS, 0-3 
TONIGHT.
TYING RUN ON 
BASE HERE IN THE
BOTTOM OF THE 
7TH.
FASTBALL BACK.
FIRST PITCH AT 
94 MILE-PER-HOUR
FROM LINEBRINK.
SCOTTY LAST 
WORKED GAME 2 OF
THE SERIES AT 
ANAHEIM.
ACTUALLY IT WAS 
A SUNDAY GAME 
WHEN SCOTT GOT 
HIS MOST RECENT 
WORK.
HE PITCHED AN 
INNING AND 
1/3RD, NOT 
ALLOWING A HIT, 
NOR DID HE WALK 
A HITTER.
AS WE TALKED 
ABOUT A LITTLE 
OVER THE 
WEEKEND, SCOTT 
IS ONE OF THOSE 
GUYS THAT 
THRIVES IN THE 
HEAT.
HE LOVES T. 
LOVES PITCHING 
IN IT, LOVES 
FISHING IN IT, 
LOVES PLAYING 
HIS GUITAR IN 
IT.
CHECKS IN ON 
MARK DeROSA.
MARK: JUST MAKES
YOU FEEL LOOSE, 
LIKE YOU'RE 
GETTING SOME 
WORK IN.
A LOT OF 
TIMES -- 
ESPECIALLY IN 
JOAQUIN ARIAS, 
SPRING TRAINING,
YOU WORKUP A 
LATH THEY ARE, 
YOU SIT DOWN IN 
THE DUGOUT AND 
YOU DRY UP, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
DRY HEAT.
HERE THE 
HUMIDITY, YOU 
GET HOT, YOU 
STAY HOT.
MATT: MARK 
DeROSA RUNS AND 
MENCH FOULS IT 
AWAY TO FALL 
BEHIND, 1-2.
YOU FIND IT 
INTERESTING -- I
CERTAINLY DO -- 
THAT NOWHERE IN 
THE BALLPARK 
HAVE THEY 
DISPLAYED A 
SCORE OF THE 
MAVERICKS GAME.
MARK: I FIND 
THAT ODD, YES.
MATT: WHEN ONE 
OF THE TEAMS IN 
THE MARKET GOES 
DEEP INTO THE 
POST SEASON, YOU
FEEL THE LOVE, 
RIGHT?
YOU SHOULDN'T 
FEEL THE 
COMPETITION.
NOT ONCE AND 
THAT GAME IS AT 
HALF TIME.
NOT ONCE HAVE 
THEY PUT THE 
SCORE UP.
MENCH POPS IT 
UP, SUCH A 
MENCH.
MARK: SWEET MAN.
MATT: NOTHING 
AGAINST A 
COMBINATION OF 
RELIEVERS IN THE
7TH.
WE MOVE ON TO 
THE 8TH.
MARK: THAT'S 
SWEET MAN.
MATT: 6 TO 5 SAN
DIEGO AS WE GO 
TO THE TOP HALF 
OF INNING NO. 8 
AND ANOTHER 
PITCHING CHANGE.
WHO SAID THEY 
DIDN'T CHANGE 
PITCHERS IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
RICK BAUER WILL 
WORK THE 8TH.
AND HE GETS 
JOHNSON, 
CASTILLA
CASTILLA.
MARK: THE PADRES
CAPITALIZED ON 
THE PITCHING 
CHANGES, AND 
SCORED A FEW
MARK: AFTER 
LOOKING AT THAT 
PLAY, I THINK 
YOUNG HAD TIME 
TO GET IN FRONT 
OF THIS BALL.
IT WASN'T HIT 
ALL THAT HARD.
YOU CAN SEE HIM 
CHOPPING STEP, 
YOU KNOW WHAT I 
MEAN?
THAT GAVE HIM 
TIME TO GET THE 
BALL.
MATT: TRYING TO 
MAKE THE OMAR 
VIZQUEL PLAY.
NOW BEN JOHNSON,
WHO DOUBLED AT 
THE START OF A 
3-RUN INNING 
LAST TIME HE WAS
AT-BAT.
LOOKS LIKE 
THEY'RE GOING TO
CREDIT VINNY 
WITH A HIT ON 
THAT BALL.
SO AN 
INNING-OPENING 
SINGLE FORECAST.
FOR CASTILLA.
WE MENTIONED 
BOUR HAS 
CONSIDERABLE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
EXPERIENCE WITH 
BALTIMORE, AND 
HE SEEMINGLY 
RODE THAT BIG 
LEAGUE BALTIMORE
TO TRIPLE-A 
ROCHESTER OR 
OTTAWA TRAIN FOR
THE PAST 5 
YEARS.
5 YEARS WITH THE
OTTAWA 
AFFILIATE.
MARK: THAT'S 
TOUGH.
IT'S NOT EASY.
MATTY, DO YOU 
KNOW WHAT I'M 
SAYING?
MATT: STILL 
BEATS WORKING 
FOR A LIVING, 
THOUGH.
MARK: IT DOES, 
DON'T GET ME 
WRONG.
IT'S AMAZING 
WHAT THE MIND 
AND BODY CAN DO 
TO STILL GET TO 
YOUR DREAM.
THIS IS THE 
BUSINESS WE 
CHOOSE.
>> THIS IS THE 
LIFE WE HAVE 
CHOSEN.
>>> IS THAT THE 
WORDS?
MATT: YOU NEED A
NAP.
MARK: I SLEPT 
UNTIL 2 TODAY.
MATT: [CHUCKLES]
REALLY?
MARK: I DON'T 
NEED NO NAP.
I DON'T NEED A 
NAP, RATHER.
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND A STRIKE TO 
JOHNSON.
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK, MUDCAT, 
YOU PUT 
SOMETHING ON 
HERE, SEND 
VINNY?
YOU CAN SAY 
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
MARK: NO, I 
THINK YOU CAN, 
BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T WANT TO GO
3-1.
I THINK YOU 
MIGHT THROW HIM 
A STRIKE AND I 
THINK BUCK 
SHOWALTER AND 
THE RANGERS ARE 
THINKING, HEY, 
WE HAVE TROUBLE 
OVER ON FIRST 
BASE.
BECAUSE IF YOU 
GO TO 3-1 WITH 
JOHNSON THEN YOU
HAVE TO THROW 
HIM A STRIKE TO 
TRY TO KEEP THEM
FROM GOING FIRST
AND SECOND.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS, GOOD 
THING VINNY 
WASN'T GOING 
ANYWHERE.
HERE IS A PRETTY
GOOD EX-BIG 
LEAGUER LOOK 
ALIKE, FLIP HIM 
AROUND, TAKE 30 
YEARS OFF THE 
CALENDAR.
MARK: CAN I 
GUESS?
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: MARK 
FIDRICH.
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: GOOD CALL.
MATT: OUT OF 
STRETCH, 
CONSERVATIVE 
LEAD AND JOHNSON
LINES INTO LEFT.
MARK: HOW ABOUT 
THE NO. 8 AND 9 
GUYS IN THE 
PADRE LINE UP, 
CASTILLA AND 
JOHN SOVENLT 5 
HITS BETWEEN 
BOTH OF THEM.
MATT:
GOT SOMETHING 
MIDDLE IN, 
THROWS THE HEAD,
NICELY DONE 
MATT: AGGRESSIVE
AT THE PLATE, 
BENNY HAS DONE A
FINE JOB TONIGHT
IN HIS FIRST 
START BACK AT 
THE MAJOR LEAGUE
LEVEL AFTER 
BEING SUMMONED 
UP FROM TRIPLE-A
PORTLAND, AND 
NOW MIKE CAMERON
WHO HAS WALKED 
AND HIT A HOME 
RUN TONIGHT.
CAMERON BUNTING.
STARTER VICENTE 
PADILLA WENT 5 
AND 1/3RD 
TONIGHT, AND 
IT'S BEEN THE 
COMBINATION OF 
FELDMAN, COREY 
AND BAUER SINCE 
THEN.
YOU KNOW, YOU 
HEAR IT 
DISCUSSED WHEN 
PEOPLE BREAKDOWN
AN NFL ROSTER 
WHERE A TEAM 
SPENDS ITS 
MONEY, DO YOU 
SPEND IT FROM 
THE OUTSIDE IN 
WITH THE SKILLED
POSITION GUYS 
AND PIECE 
TOGETHER A LINE 
OR DO YOU DO IT 
THE OTHER WAY.
CAMERON BUNTING.
IS THAT CAUGHT?
IT IS AND 
ROBERTS IS 
DOUBLED UP.
WHAT A PLAY BY 
MARK TEIXEIRA.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MARK: MIKE 
CAMERON GETS 
UNDERNEATH THIS 
BASEBALL, AND 
MARK TEIXEIRA 
CHARGING MAKES 
THE CATCH, AND 
YOU CAN SEE IN 
THE BACKGROUND 
THAT BEN JOHNSON
WAS ANTICIPATING
THAT BALL BEING 
DOWN AND HE DOES
NOT GET BACK IN 
TIME, SO CREDIT,
ALSO, KINSLER 
BACKING UP ON 
THAT BLA FOR THE
FORCE PLAY AND 
THE DOUBLE-UP.
MATT: SO 2 GONE,
A RUNNER AT 
SECOND BASE AND 
MARK CONNOR 
COMES OUT TO 
VISIT WITH HIS 
RELIEVER.
I WANT TO GET 
BACK TO THE 
PAYROLL THING IN
A MOMENT, BUT 
THIS IS WHERE 
WHEN YOU PLAY 
MANAGER AT HOME,
WHEN YOU PLAY 
MANAGER IN THE 
STANDS, AND YOU 
GET ON A GUY FOR
NOT BUNTING, HOW
COME YOU'RE NOT 
BUNTING HERE?
CERTAIN GUYS 
DON'T BUNT VERY 
WELL.
MARK: SOME GUYS 
ARE PAID TO HIT,
SOME GUYS ARE 
PAID TO BUNT.
MATT: SO YOU 
DON'T ALWAYS PUT
THE BUNT PLAY ON
IN SITUATIONS 
100% OF THE TIME
AND THAT TIME 
BOCH PLAYED THE 
BUNT, AND HIS 
PLAYER DIDN'T 
EXECUTE.
MARK: EXACTLY.
MATT: SO NOW 
GEOFF BLUM 
TRYING TO COME 
OUT WITH A 2-OUT
KNOCK TO BRING 
THE RUN IN.
MARK: HE PLAYED 
IN THE BEST 
INTEREST OF HIS 
TEAM TO GET THE 
RUNNERS OVER.
THE PLAYER 
DIDN'T EXECUTE.
MATT: 2 BALLS, 
NO STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO BLUM.
MARK: AND MIKE 
CAMERON WOULD 
TELL YOU "I BLEW
IT.
I DIDN'T GET THE
JOB DONE."
MATT: GREAT PLAY
BY MARK TEIXEIRA
AGAIN.
OH MY GOODNESS, 
DUDE HERE SAVED 
A FEW RUNS.
NOT 1 BUT 2 
FANTASTIC 
EFFORTS BY MARK 
TEIXEIRA IN THE 
FIELD.
NOTHING IN THE 
PADRE 8TH.
MATT: BE SURE 
TOP TUNE INTO 
SAN DIEGO 
INSIDER TOMORROW
NIGHT.
IMMEDIATELY 
AFTER THE PADRES
GAME TOMORROW 
NIGHT.
THE BATTLE LINES
ARE BEING DRAWN 
IN THE FIGHT OF 
WHERE TO PUT SAN
DIEGO'S AIRPORT,
AND SOME SAY 
MIRAMAR IS THE 
ANSWER, AND SOME
SAY NO WAY.
WILL JOINT USE 
WORK?
SOME SAY IT 
WILL.
AFTER LIVE 
COVERAGE OF THE 
PADRES.
MARK: WHY DO YOU
THINK IT SHOULD 
GO?
MATT: I DON'T 
KNOW A THING 
ABOUT THE ISSUE 
AND I'M NOT 
ABOUT TO OPINE.
WHERE DO YOU 
THINK?
RAMONA, 
SOMEPLACE CLOSE 
TO THE HOUSE, 
ALPINE?
HERE IS BRAD 
WILKERSON 
LEADING THINGS 
OFF IN THE HOME 
8TH.
LINEBRINK SEWED 
UP THE FINAL OUT
IN THE 7TH, 
GETTING THE 
FINAL BASE 
RUNNER.
HIS LAST OUTING 
WAS GOOD FOR AN 
INNING AND A 
THIRD.
HE HAS BRAD 
WILKERSON OUT IN
FRONT.
MARK: THAT LAST 
HIT BY MARK 
DeROSA IS THE 
DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN NOT 
FACING A GUY 
LIKE HANK 
BLALOCK AND MARK
TEIXEIRA, AND IF
IT'S A PERFECT 
INNING, YOU HAVE
1, 2, 3 AND MARK
TEIXEIRA WOULD 
BE THIRD.
MATT: MARK 
TEIXEIRA WITH A 
COUPLE OF 
FANTASTIC PLAYS 
IN THAT TOP OF 
THE 8TH TO KEEP 
THE PADRES OFF 
THE BOARD.
I DON'T THINK 
THE RANGERS HAVE
BEEN WITHOUT AN 
IMPACT FIRST 
BASEMAN SINCE 
THEY MOVED INTO 
THIS BALLPARK 
SOME 12 YEARS 
AGO.
PALMERO FOR SO 
MANY YEARS, LEE 
STEVENS 
REJUVENATED HIS 
CAREER HERE, AS 
A RANGER, HAD A 
COUPLE OF GOOD 
YEARS, AND MORE 
RECENTLY, A 
NUMBER OF 
TALENTED FIRST 
BASE MEN, AS 
BRAD WILKERSON 
SWINGS AND 
MISSES.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
TO FORMER RANGER
PROPERTY TRAVIS 
HAFNER, THEY 
HAVE 
MANUFACTURED 
SOME GOOD CORNER
INFIELDERS, 
HERE.
MARK: LOOK AT 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
HE COULD PASS 
FOR THE LITTLE 
BROTHER OF MARK 
CUBAN, OWNER OF 
THE DALLAS MAVS.
MATT: I'M SURE 
HE'LL BE 
THRILLED TO HEAR
THAT.
IAN KINSLER WITH
1 GONE.
LOOKS LIKE A BAT
BOY.
THAT'S TO BLUM.
GET THE OUT.
FOR A GUY THAT'S
ACCOMPLISHED AS 
MUCH AS MARK 
TEIXEIRA HAS 
ACCOMPLISHED IN 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
BASEBALL, HE'S 
ONLY 25, 26.
IF YOU PUT A NO.
99 ON HIS BACK 
AND GAVE HIM 
RUBBER CLEATS, 
HE WOULD LOOK 
LIKE A BAT BOY.
WHAT A GREAT 
FUTURE.

ANOTHER PITCHING
CHANGE FOR THE 
RANGERS.
THEY'RE ON 35TH 
OF THE EVENING.
LEFT HANDER RON 
MAHAY TAKES OVER
IN THE 9TH.
MARK: THE LAST 
15 APPEARANCES 
FOR THE LEFT 
HANDER, HE'S 
ONLY GIVEN UP 3 
RUNS.
WE TALKED ABOUT 
HITTING NUMBERS,
AND RON IS 
HOLDING LEFTIES 
TO A .175 
AVERAGE.
AND WHAT DO YOU 
KNOW, BUCK 
SHOWALTER KNOWS 
THAT GILES IS 
LEADING OFF, 
HE'S GOING TO 
LOOK AT 
PERCENTAGES, 
HERE.
MATT: RON MAHAY 
IS IN HIS 4TH 
YEAR HERE WITH 
THE RANGERS.
HE HAS BEEN ONE 
OF BUCK 
SHOWALTER'S 
FAVORITE GUYS TO
USE IN THIS 
BALLPARK.
HIS CAREER 
E.R.A. HERE MANY
ARLINGTON COMING
INTO THE YEAR, 
2.90. THAT IS 
THE SECOND 
LOWEST AMONG 
QUALIFIED 
RANGERS OF ALL 
TIME.
AND HE GETS 
GILES TO GROUND 
OUT TO OPEN THE 
9TH.
RON MAHAY GOT A 
LOT OF ATTENTION
NERL HIS CAREER 
WHEN HE BROKE IN
WITH THE RED SOX
IN 1997 AS HE 
HAD PLAYED HIS 
ENTIRE MINOR 
LEAGUE CAREER 
PREVIOUSLY AS A 
POSITION PLAYER.
THE RED SOX, 
RATHER LATE IN 
HIS BASEBALL 
LIFE PUT HIM ON 
THE MOUND.
HE'S HAD NOTHING
BUT SUCCESS 
SINCE.
34-YEAR OLD 
SOUTHPAW HAS 
BEEN AT THE BIG 
LEAGUE LEVEL IN 
ONE UNIFORM OR 
ANOTHER SINCE 
THAT '97 
CAMPAIGN.
TIME WITH THE 
MARLINS, A'S, 
CUBS, TWO QUICK 
OUTS FOR RON 
MAHAY HERE IN 
THE 9TH.
MARK: MAY HAY MAHAY HAS 
A BREAKING BALL,
AND IF YOU ARE A
POSITION PLAYER 
EXAMINE THINGS 
AREN'T GOING 
YOUR WAY, WHY 
NOT GET UP ON 
THE HILL, GIVE 
IT A CHANCE.
MATT: TREVOR 
HOFFMAN UP IN 
THE SAN DIEGO 
BULLPEN.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
WITH A BOUNCING 
BALL TO KINSLER 
WHO HAD HIM 
DEFENDED 
PERFECTLY AND 
IT'S A VERY 
QUICK 1, 2, 3.
TREVOR UP NEXT.
MATT: LAST OF 
THE 9TH, SAN 
DIEGO UP A RUN 
AND THEY TURN TO
CLOSER TREVOR 
HOFFMAN TO TRY 
TO SHUT THIS ONE
DOWN ON THE 
ROAD.
TREVOR LOOKING 
FOR SAVE 17TONIGHT AS IT 
APPEARS MORE AND
MORE LIKELY WITH
EACH SAVE 
OPPORTUNITY THAT
HE IS HEADED TO 
THE ALL-STAR 
GAME FOR THE 5TH
TIME IN HIS 
CAREER.
HE WILL FACE THE
RANGERS HERE, 
TOP OF THE 
OSHGSD AND 
BETWEEN GARY 
MA 
AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA, THERE 
IS A COMBINED 
ONE AT-BAT, AND 
THAT'S GARY 
MATTHEWS, W IS
0 FOR 1 AGAINST 
HOFFMAN, AND WE 
KNOW THAT THOSE 
SITUATIONS 
USUALLY FAVOR 
THE PADRES, 
ESPECIALLY WITH 
TREVOR'S 
CHANGE-UP.
BOWEN REPLACING 
BA BEHIND THE 
PLATE.
MARK: LAST TIME 
OUT FOR TWEFR 
TREVOR
-- TREVOR WAS 
THAT TIME IN 
ANAHEIM LAST 
FRIDAY, WHERE HE
PUNCHEDED OUT 
THE BATTERS.
MATT: TREVOR 
STARTS HIM WITH 
A FASTBALL, 
HIGH.
1-1.
THE RANGERS HAVE
STRUGGLED IN 
1-RUN GAMES THIS
YEAR, 8, 12
LOSSES, SAN 
DIEGO 12-9 IN 
ONE-RUN AFFAIRS.
TEXAS HAD SO 
MANY TROUBLE 
EARL CLOSING OUT
BALL GAMES.
SOME FAILED 
CLOSERS 
EXPERIMENTS, AKI
SETTLED IN 
NICELY TO DO A 
GOOD JOB IN THE 
BACK OF THEIR 
BULLPEN.
REMEMBER, HE DID
NOT START THE 
YEAR AS THEIR 
CLOSER.
THIS IS WHERE 
SAN DIEGO HAS 
HAD THE KIND OF 
CONSISTENCY THAT
WE MIGHT TAKE 
FOR GRANTED IN 
OTHER MAJOR 
LEAGUE CITIES.
2-2.
TREVOR IN HIS 
CAREER HAS 
PITCHED HERE IN 
THIS BALLPARK 
TWICE.
HE SAVED ONE OF 
THOSE TWO GAMES,
BUT IN 2 AND 
1/3RD INNINGS 
WORKED TOTAL 
HERE, HAS GIVEN 
UP 3 EARNED 
RUNS, SO LIMITED
EXPERIENCE, BUT 
YOU COULDN'T 
CALL THIS ONE OF
HIS FAVORITE 
VENUES.
A GREAT PLAY BY 
BLUM, THE THROW 
IS IN TIME TO 
GET HIM!
WE WILL LOOK 
BACK ON THAT 
PLAY AND KNOW 
HOW BIG IT IS!
MAN!
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT, MATTY?
FROM MY VANTAGE 
POINT I THINK 
THE PADRES 
CAUGHT A BREAK.
FROM THE LEFT 
SIDE, GARY 
MATTHEWS CAN RUN
A LITTLE BIT.
HE GETS 
SOMETHING UP, HE
TOPS IT, AND NOW
THE RACE IS ON.
BLUM HAS TO 
FIELD IT ON THE 
RUN, THROW, 
VERY, VERY 
CLOSE.
MATT: I'LL TELL 
YOU WHO MADE 
THAT HAPPEN, A 
GREAT EFFORT BY 
BLUM, NO 
QUESTION, BUT 
ADRIAN GOT OUT 
THERE AS FAR AS 
HE COULD STARTED
TO MOVE THE 
GLOVE EARL 
ENOUGH TO HELP 
SELL THE CALL.
AND THERE IS 1 
HUGE OUT TO 
START THE LAST 
OF THE 9TH.
NOW MICHAEL 
YOUNG.
YOUNG SINGLED 
AND SCORED IN 
THE 5TH.
AGAIN, THESE TWO
HITTERS, 
SPEAKING OF 
YOUNG AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA ON 
DECK, HAVE NEVER
FACED TREVOR 
HOFFMAN.
1-1.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
HAS MADE HIS 
PRESENCE FELT 
TONIGHT 2 FOR 4 
WITH AN R.B.I. 
AND FANTASTIC 
DEFENSE.
MARK: I 
MENTIONED LATE 
IN THE BALL GAME
THAT THE PITCHER
WILL TRY TO KEEP
THE BALL A 
WACHLT BELIEVE 
IT.
WITH THESE 
HITTERS, THE 
RANGERS, YOU CAN
KEEP IT AWAY BUT
YOU BETTER KEEP 
IT DOWN.
THEY CAN GO OUT 
AND INTO SOME 
FIELD ON YOU IF 
YOU DON'T.
MATT: 1-2.
A BOUNCING BALL 
UP THE MIDDLE, 
THAT ONE IS 
GOING TO GET 
BUY.
TYING RUN 
ABOARD, THE 
WINNING RUN 
STEPS TO THE 
PLATE.
WELL NOW WITHOUT
QUESTION YOU'RE 
INTO THE 
SCARIEST PART OF
THE RANGERS LINE
UP.
YOUNG HAS 
SINGLED, AND NOW
YOU GOT MARK 
TEIXEIRA, AND 
SAVE A DOUBLE 
PLAY, YOU'RE 
GOING TO HAVE TO
DEAL WITH 
BLALOCK AS WELL.
MARK: MENTIONED 
HIGH, FASTBALL 
HITTERS, LOVE TO
SWING THE BAT.
HOW DO YOU TAKE 
THE STING OUT?
THE BIG KEY FOR 
TREVOR IS 
GETTING AHEAD 
0-1 WITH A 
FASTBALL AND 
THEN YOU CAN 
PLAY GAMES WITH 
THEM WITH A 
CHANGE-UP.
MATT: WELL THE 
GOOD NEWS ON 
TEIXEIRA'S LINE 
IS IS THAT HE 
HAS GROUNDED 
INTO 10 DOUBLE 
PLAYS, AND ONLY 
YOUNG HAS 
GROUNDED INTO 
MORE.
2-0 NOW.
EACH ROSTER IS 
UP ON THE TOP 
STEP IN THIS 
ONE, A ONE-RUN 
BALL GAME, END 
OF THE 9TH.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
A WORLD SERIES 
GAME, DOESN'T 
IT?
MATT: THROWING 
CABBAGE AROUND 
THE DUGOUT.
IF THAT'S 
FAIR -- IT'S A 
FOUL BALL.
AN EMPHATIC CALL
BY FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE MARK 
TEIXEIRA RAISE 
HIS WARMS IN THE
BOX?
MATT: I DIDN'T 
SEE THAT ONE 
BEING THAT 
CLOSE.
HERE COMES BUCK 
SHOWALTER.
MARK: NOT FROM 
MY VANTAGE 
POINT, NO.
MATT:

MATT: THAT'S -- 
MARK: IT'S TOUGH
TO TELL, BECAUSE
OF WHERE THE 
BALL LANDS.
NOW, A 
STRAIGHT-ON 
SHOT, HE SAYS 
DEFINITELY IT'S 
GONE.
MATT: BUCK 
SHOWALTER STILL 
OUT THERE 
SHOUTING WITH 
BILL WELKIE.
MARK: THEY GOING
TO ASK FOR HELP?
MATT: NO.
HOW DOES THE 
THIRD BASE 
UMPIRE HELP THE 
FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE ON THAT 
BALL?
I MEAN THE HOME 
PLATE UMPIRE, 
MAYBE, BUT HE'S 
CALLING THIRD 
BASEMPIRE 
MARTY FOSTER AND
THE WHOLE CREW 
IS GOING TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ONE.
IF THEY CHAVENG 
THE CALL YOU'RE 
GOING TO HAVE A 
VISITING TEAM 
ERUPT.
FOUL BALL.
MARK: THE ONLY 
WAY YOU'RE GOING
TO TELL IF 
THAT'S FAIR OR 
FOUL IS IF YOU 
HAVE A CAMERA 
DIRECTLY IN LINE
BEHIND HOME 
PLATE DOWN THE 
FIRST BASELINE.
MATT: BOY, HE 
HIT THE SNOT OUT
OF THAT BALL, 
DIDN'T HE?
MARK: YEAH, DE.
MATT: LORD!
ALL RIGHT.
2 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE.
AFTER A 600 FOOT
FOUL BALL FROM 
MARK TEIXEIRA.
2-2.
MARK: GOING 
BACK, HE SOLD 
THAT ONE, DIDN'T
HE?
HE WAS GOING 
DOWN THE FIRST 
BASELINE PUMPING
HIS FISTS.
MATT: I THINK 
THAT WAS 
SINCERE.
MARK: I THINK IT
WAS, TOO.
MATT: POPPED HIM
UP.
MATT: WELL, 
MARK, THEY SAY 
IT'S A GAME OF 
ISSUES.
MARK: THE ONLY 
OTHER WAY TO 
TELL IS IF THAT 
FOUL POLE IS 
EXTENDED 
ANOTHER, WHAT, 
20 FEET IN THE 
AIR?
THAT FOUL POLE 
IS UP THERE, 
MATTY.
HOW TALL IS 
THAT?
50, 60 FEET, 80 
FEET, 90 FEET?
MATT: IT'S TALL.
HANK BLALOCK 
NOW.
MODERN DAY 
MURDERERS' ROW, 
AND TREVOR 
TRYING TO HOLD 
IT TO A 9TH 
INNING SINGLE TO
TOLD TO A SAVE, 
HERE.
1-1.
THERE ARE
OPPORTUNITIES 
AND THERE ARE 
SAVE 
OPPORTUNITIES.
MARK: AGAINST A 
TEAM LIKE THIS, 
YEAH.
MATT: THIS ONE 
SHOULD BE WORTH 
10 OR 15 ROLAIDS
RELIEF POINTS.
[CHUCKLES] 1-2.
HOFFMAN TRYING 
TO SAVE IT FOR

PROGRAM IS A PAID PRESENTATION
FOR RED.
[...]
ARE YOU TIRED OF 
CONSTANTLY FIGHTING THAT GROWING
MIDSECTION OR HAVE YOU GIVEN UP
ON THOSE LESS-THAN-LOVEABLE LOVE
HANDLES AND FLABBY POOCH AREA?
ENDLESS CRUNCHES ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE AND STRAIN
THE NECK AND BACK, PLUS
WHO REALLY HAS TIME TO GO
TO THE GYM?
YOU MAY HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED
EXPENSIVE LIPOSUCTION,
COSTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
JUST TO GET IN SHAPE.
>> I FIGHT THE POOCH.
>> THE POOCH, THE POUCH--
I CALL IT "THE POUCH."
>> BEER BELLY, WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO CALL IT... BUDDHA ON YOUR
STOMACH, RIGHT IN THE FRONT.
>> FAT IN THE ABDOMINAL AREA IS
THE HARDEST TO WORK ON.
>> I HATE TO WORK OUT AND I HATE
TO DO ABS BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL.
>> Announcer: NOW SLIMMING HAS
COME FULL CIRCLE.
INTRODUCING RED, THE FIRST
RESISTANCE EXERCISE DISC,
THE EASIEST AND MOST COMFORTABLE
WAY TO STRENGTHEN AND SCULPT
AN AMAZING CORE AND MIDSECTION.
>> I LOST THREE DRESS SIZES.
>> GOT MY WAIST DOWN SIX INCHES.
>> I LOST SEVEN AND A HALF
INCHES OFF MY WAIST.
>> Announcer: RED'S HIGH-TECH
SLENDERIZING SECRET...
ROTATES AND TWISTS THE CORE
AND TORSO THROUGH A CIRCULAR
RANGE OF MOTION.
IT TIGHTENS AND TONES MUSCLES,
ALL THE WAY AROUND YOUR
WAISTLINE IN CONTINUOUS,
SWEEPING MOVEMENTS THAT ARE
EASY TO DO.
RED'S UNIQUE EXERCISE FOCUSES
MUSCLE SCULPTING RESISTANCE
ON YOUR MIDSECTION, WORKING OUT
YOUR STOMACH, ABS AND
LOVE HANDLE OBLIQUES--
YOUR ENTIRE PROBLEM AREA.
>> I LOST SEVEN INCHES OFF
MY WAIST.
>> I LOST NINE INCHES OFF
MY WAIST.
AND FOUR AND A HALF INCHES OFF
MY HIPS.
>> Announcer: THAT MEANS RED
STRENGTHENS CORE MUSCLES
AND PULLS YOUR TORSO INWARD,
MAKING A TIGHTER, SMALLER
CIRCLE, AND THAT'S WHAT HELPS
SHRINK INCHES OFF YOUR WAISTLINE
FOR REAL RESULTS.
AND RED'S TORSION MAX RESISTANCE
SYSTEM PACKS A POWERFUL PUNCH.
TO INTENSIFY THE BURN,
YOU SELECT A DESIRED RESISTANCE
AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.
AS YOU TURN, YOU'LL FEEL YOUR
CORE WORKING DEEPER AND HARDER.
INSTANTLY, YOUR WORKOUT BECOMES
MORE CHALLENGING.
YOU'LL FEEL THE BURN FASTER
WHERE YOU NEED IT TO SCULPT
A SLIMMER, NEW YOU.

>> Announcer: TOP TRAINERS AND
FITNESS EXPERTS HAVE KNOWN
THE POWER OF ROTATION FOR YEARS.
RED BRINGS THAT POWER TO YOU.
THERE'S NO STRAIN ON YOUR
NECK OR BACK BECAUSE
YOU'RE COMFORTABLY SEATED IN
AN UPRIGHT POSITION.
RED IS COMFORTABLE BECAUSE
OUR DEEP-PADDED MEMORY FOAM IS
EASY ON THE BACKSIDE,
AND RED'S ERGONOMIC HANDLES
ADJUST TO FIT YOU.
PLUS, RED IS WHISPER SILENT
SO YOU CAN WATCH YOUR FAVORITE
TV SHOW AND BURN COUNTLESS
CALORIES WITH EASE.
>> IT'S JUST TOO EASY.
>> IT'S NOT COMPLICATED AT ALL.
YOU SIT ON IT AND YOU TWIST.
>> A CHILD COULD DO IT,
IT REALLY IS THAT EASY.
>> Announcer: EXERCISE EQUIPMENT
SHOULDN'T BE AN EYESORE OR TAKE
UP A WHOLE ROOM, SO WE DESIGNED
RED TO BE COMPACT.
IT FOLDS DOWN AND STORES AWAY IN
SECONDS, BUT RED IS ONE SERIOUS
MACHINE-- ENGINEERED AND RATED
TO SUPPORT UP TO 350 POUNDS.
AND RED IS QUALITY.
ITS HEAVY-DUTY STEEL
CONSTRUCTION IS BUILT TO LAST
A LIFETIME.
RED'S THE MOST AMAZING WAY
TO SCULPT LEAN, SEXY ABS WHILE
SLIMMING YOUR MIDSECTION.
AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON SAYS,
"RED INCORPORATES ALL OF
THE MUSCLES IN THE CORE REGION,
PLUS THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER
BACK, QUADRICEPS AND EVEN
THE UPPER BODY."
WHAT THIS MEANS IS YOU'LL SLIM,
STRENGTHEN AND SCULPT YOUR CORE
FROM EVERY DIRECTION.
RED'S SMOOTH, UNIQUE MOVEMENT
DOES IT ALL.
>> EVEN THOUGH RED IS EASY, IT
DEFINITELY GIVES YOU A WORKOUT.
>> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD
MUSCLES LIKE THAT.
>> RED WORKS EVERYTHING.
>> I'VE LOST WEIGHT EVERYWHERE.
I'VE BEEN AMAZED EVERY DAY.
>> THIS IS RED, AND IT PUTS
A WHOLE NEW SPIN ON AB EXERCISE
BY TONING TIGHT CORE ABDOMINALS
AND SHRINKING YOUR WAISTLINE
USING ROTATIONAL AB EXERCISE
THAT'S EASY ON YOUR BODY AND
EASY ON YOUR BACK.
RED FIRST STRETCHES AND
THEN STRENGTHENS ALL YOUR
CORE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES WITH
SIMPLE TORSO ROTATIONS.
EACH ROTATION WORKS ALL YOUR
ABS-- UPPER, MIDDLE, LOWER, AND,
OF COURSE, THOSE LOVE HANDLES.
>> AND UNTIL NOW, THERE'S NEVER
BEEN AN EXERCISE THAT GAVE US
FOCUSED, FAT-BURNING CARDIO PLUS
A FULL CORE ABDOMINAL WORKOUT IN
THE SAME EXERCISE.
>> Rachel: RED TAKES AB EXERCISE
IN A WHOLE NEW DIRECTION,
TWISTING OFF POUNDS AND INCHES
WITH SIMPLE, EASY-TO-DO CORE
ROTATIONS, PROVEN TO SCULPT
A LEAN, SEXY MIDSECTION.
RED ATTACKS THAT POOCH AREA.
FIRMING UP HAS NEVER BEEN SO
COMFORTABLE AND EASY.
IT'S THE SOLUTION FOR THE POOCH.
>> I'VE BEEN USING RED, AND IT
GOT MY WAIST DOWN SIX INCHES.
>> WITH RED FITNESS,
I LOST 19 POUNDS.
>> I LOST THREE DRESS
SIZES. [LAUGHS]
>> I LOST FOUR INCHES OFF
MY WAIST AND FOUR AND A HALF
INCHES OFF MY HIPS IN TWO MONTHS
USING RED.
>> I LOST SEVEN AND
A HALF INCHES OFF MY WAIST
IN EIGHT WEEKS.
>> I LOST NINE INCHES OFF
MY WAIST... I'M STILL IN SHOCK.
>> AND I'M WEARING PANTS THAT
I HAVEN'T WORN IN A LONG TIME.
>> I LOST FOUR INCHES OFF
OF EACH THIGH USING RED.
>> MY WAIST HAS GOTTEN
SMALLER WITH RED.
>> I'M ABLE TO FIT INTO
SMALLER CLOTHES.
>> Announcer: RED BRINGS
AB TONING FULL CIRCLE.
YOU TONE ROCK-HARD ABS AND
A TIGHTER, SLIMMER WAISTLINE
WITHOUT THE BACK-BREAKING
BENDING OF CONVENTIONAL
AB EXERCISES.
THE KEY TO A SEXY, SLENDER
STOMACH IS WORKING YOUR ABS
AND CORE THROUGH A FULL RANGE
OF MOTION.
WHEN YOU USE RED, YOU'LL ENGAGE
YOUR AB AND CORE MUSCLES WITH
A GREATER RANGE OF ROTATIONAL
MOTION ON EVERY REP.
THAT GETS YOU FASTER SLIMMING
WITH LESS EFFORT.
YOU CAN DO DOZENS OR HUNDREDS OF
CRUNCHES AND SIT-UPS, OR YOU CAN
TAKE A SHORT SPIN ON RED AND
TONE SEXY, SLENDER WASHBOARD
ABS IN MINUTES.
>> IT'S EXCITING TO KNOW THAT
YOU CAN TONE A FLAT, FIRM
STOMACH WITHOUT EVER HAVING
TO DO ANOTHER CRUNCH OR
A SIT-UP EVER AGAIN.
RED'S BROUGHT ABS TONING
FULL CIRCLE.
HERE'S HOW TO GET YOUR OWN RED.
>> Announcer: ARE YOU TIRED OF 
CONSTANTLY FIGHTING THAT GROWING
MIDSECTION OR HAVE YOU GIVEN UP

WE WANTED TO INTRODUCE RED TO
THE TOUGHEST GROUP WE COULD
THINK OF... A GROUP OF
FIREFIGHTERS.
THESE GUYS KNOW ALL ABOUT USING
EQUIPMENT TO GET A JOB DONE.
AT FIRST, THEY WERE SKEPTICAL...
>> THERE IS NOTHING MORE BORING
IN THE WORLD THAN WORKING OUT.
>> REAL TEST IS TO GET IT
PAST US.
WE TEND TO BE HARD ON STUFF.
>> Announcer: ...UNTIL THEY
TRIED IT.
>> FEELS GOOD.
>> IT'S PRETTY SOLID.
>> IT'S REALLY SMOOTH.
IT MOVES VERY EASILY.
IT'S PRETTY COOL. [CHUCKLES]
>> I WEIGH 250 POUNDS.
THIS IS SUPPORTING ME JUST FINE.
>> ONCE YOU GET GOING, YOU CAN
START FEELING IT.
ON THE SIDES, DEFINITELY.
>> HOO, THERE IT IS!
>> YEAH, YOU CAN FEEL IT
BURNING RIGHT HERE.
>> WELL, I'M FEELING IT IN
MY LOWER ABS, AND I'M ALSO
FEELING IT IN MY OBLIQUES.
[GEAR CRANKS]
>> THE CORE AND ALL THE WAY IN
TO THE BACK, YOU CAN FEEL IT.
THE MORE YOU DO IT, YOU START
FEELING THE BURN.
IT FEELS GOOD.
>> SEE, I CAN, I CAN FEEL IT
HERE BUT I CAN ALSO FEEL IT
A LITTLE MORE IN MY HIPS, TOO.
IT'LL BE A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> YOU CAN GET A GOOD WORKOUT
OUT OF THIS.
>> IT'S A NICE,
LOW-IMPACT WORKOUT.
I CAN BORROW IT FOR ABOUT SIX
WEEKS, SEE HOW... [LAUGHTER]
>> IT IS QUICK, YOU KNOW,
AND IT DOES DO ALL THE THINGS
THAT THEY'RE SAYING.
>> Man: SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ON
TO SOMETHING, MAN.
[...]
>> TOP FITNESS TRAINERS HAVE
KNOWN ABOUT THE CORE SCULPTING
POWER OF ROTATIONAL EXERCISES
FOR YEARS, BUT IT'S BEEN HARD
TO DO UNTIL NOW.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO FITNESS
PROFESSIONALS THINK OF RED?
WE TOOK IT TO SOME OF AMERICA'S
FINEST TRAINERS AND EXERCISE
PHYSIOLOGISTS AND ASKED
FOR THEIR OPINIONS.
>> I LOVE RED.
IT'S DONE A LOT FOR MY BACK AND
NECK, AND IT'S HELPED MY CORE
STRENGTH TREMENDOUSLY.
THE RESULTS I'VE SEEN... UH,
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED
RED HAVE BEEN TRULY AMAZING.
IT'S THE BEST ABDOMINAL
EXERCISER I HAVE EVER USED.
>> SO WITH RED, YOU'RE GETTING
ALL AREAS OF THE ABS.
YOU'RE GETTING THE OBLIQUES,
YOU'RE GETTING THE UPPER AB, YOU
GET THE LOWER AB, YOU'RE GETTING
THE WHOLE CENTRAL ABDOMINAL
MUSCLES, NOT JUST STRICTLY
ISOLATING ONE SMALL SECTION LIKE
THE OLD-FASHIONED AB CRUNCHERS
WHERE YOU'RE JUST COMING
STRAIGHT FORWARD AND BACK DOWN.
SO YOU BASICALLY GET A FULL
ABDOMINAL WORKOUT, HITTING
ALL AREAS OF YOUR AB MUSCLES
WITH RED.
>> WELL, WE'RE RAISING OUR HEART
RATE, WE'RE HELPING TO CIRCULATE
AND STIMULATE THE BLOOD FLOW.
I THINK RED WOULD WORK FOR
JUST ABOUT ANYONE.
>> RED IS GREAT FOR THE LOWER
ABS, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN.
UM, A LOT OF CLIENTS THAT
I HAVE WHO'VE HAD BABIES,
THIS IS GREAT.
IT REALLY GETS DEEP IN THERE,
WORKS THE CORE MUSCLES OF
THE LOWER PART OF THE ABS.
RED IS EASY.
YOU'LL GET YOUR RESULTS.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL IT IN
MY ABDOMINALS, AND I CAN ALSO
FEEL IT IN MY ARMS.
I WORK OUT ALL THE TIME AND
I CAN FEEL THIS MORE
THAN ANYTHING.
DOES IT WORK? ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE KEYS TO RAPID RESULTS ARE
A FULL RANGE OF MOTION AND USING
RESISTANCE TRAINING.
RED INVOLVES ALL OF YOUR CORE
ABDOMINAL MUSCLES TO GET THAT
RICH RANGE OF MOTION THAT
DELIVERS RESULTS.
AS YOU ROTATE ON RED,
YOUR ABS AND CORE MUSCLES
ARE BEING ACTIVATED--
FROM THE HIPS AND BACK TO
OBLIQUES TO CENTER ABS TO
OBLIQUES AND THEN YOUR BACK.
THAT'S 360 DEGREES OF CORE
ABDOMINAL TONING THAT'S
WHITTLING DOWN YOUR WAISTLINE.
>> Gary: AND WHEN RESISTANCE IS
ADDED TO THE FORMULA, THE
RESULTS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
>> BEFORE I STARTED RED, I WAS
FLABBY AND NASTY. [LAUGHS]
I WOULD WEAR BULKY CLOTHES.
AFTER USING RED AND LOSING
THE INCHES AND THE WEIGHT, I
WEAR CLOTHES THAT, YOU KNOW, FIT
ME, THAT SHOW OFF MY BODY AND IT
GOT MY WAIST DOWN SIX INCHES.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> MY STOMACH WAS HUGE.
IT WAS HUGE.
IT WAS, UH, JUST KIND
OF DISGUSTING.
WHEN I USE RED FITNESS, I,
I CAN JUST FEEL IT RIGHT...
I CAN FEEL IT AND I KNOW
IT'S WORKING.
THESE RESULTS FROM USING RED
FITNESS WERE GREAT.
>> WHY HAVEN'T EXERCISE MACHINES
KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES IN TERMS
OF COMFORT?
OUR CAR SEATS, OUR HOME AND
OFFICE FURNITURE-- EVERYTHING
TODAY IS BUILT TO BE COMFORTABLE
EXCEPT FITNESS MACHINES.
>> LET'S FACE IT: A LOT OF
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT ISN'T EASY
FOR BIGGER PEOPLE TO USE.
BUT RED'S PADDED MEMORY FOAM
SEAT CUSHION IS EXTRA WIDE AND
IT'S SOFT AND COMFY.
WHEN THE EXERCISE IS EASY
ON YOUR BODY, YOU CAN
CONCENTRATE ON WORKING OUT
WITHOUT DISTRACTION AND
WITHOUT DISCOMFORT.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO REGULAR
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT RED?
WELL, WE TOOK IT TO 
LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA
TO FIND OUT.
>> THIS IS CUSHIONY, DOES NOT
HURT YOUR BUTT LIKE SITTING ON
A WOOD FLOOR.
>> YOU GOT A LOT OF "CUSH"...
A CUSH FOR THE TUSH. [LAUGHS]
>> YOU COULD SIT HERE AND WATCH
TV WHILE YOU DO IT. [LAUGHS]
>> WOW, THIS FEELS GREAT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S WORKING ALL OF
THE RIGHT MUSCLES.
>> I'M FEELING IT HERE...
AND DOWN LOWER, TOO.
>> I'M STARTING TO FEEL
THE BURN.
>> I'M FEELING THIS BURN HERE
PRETTY FAST DOING THIS.
>> Man: YEAH, IT'S WORKING,
I CAN FEEL IT.
>> YOU CAN FEEL 'EM FLEXING AND
TIGHTENING RIGHT HERE IN
THE FRONT AND THEN ON THE SIDES.
>> I FEEL IN MY LOWER STOMACH.
>> I FEEL IT IN MY STOMACH.
>> MY STOMACH, RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE. >> HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT AROUND,
RIGHT AROUND HERE.
ON THE SIDES DOWN HERE.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL HOW IT
ISOLATES THE MUSCLES.
>> THAT LOWER, VERY LOWER AB.
>> I REALLY LIKE IT.
IT'S GOOD.
>> IT'S VERY GOOD.
>> IT'S EASY TO DO,
IT'S COMFORTABLE.
I LIKE IT, IT JUST FEELS GOOD.
>> YOU FEEL IT ALL THE WAY
AROUND YOUR WAIST, YOU FEEL IT
DOWN THE FRONT.
'CAUSE YOU CAN TELL
I'M BREATHING. [LAUGHS]
IT'S A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOING
TO GET MY SIX PACK BACK.
>> RED'S EASY ON YOUR BODY AND
IT'S ALSO EASY TO USE.
YOUR BACK REMAINS STRAIGHT AND
RELAXED BECAUSE THE VERTEBRAE IN
YOUR BACK ARE IN THE IDEAL,
RELAXED NEUTRAL POSITION.
YOU GRAB HOLD OF THE HANDLES
WHICH ADJUST TO MATCH YOUR ARM
LENGTH, AND NOW YOU JUST ROTATE
RIGHT AND LEFT AND RIGHT
AND LEFT.
AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN YOUR
ROTATION, DIFFERENT ABS AND CORE
MUSCLES ARE RECRUITED,
SO BY DOING ONE FULL REP,
YOU TONE AND STRENGTHEN ALL YOUR
CORE MUSCLES.
YOU'VE TONED YOUR WAISTLINE
ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR THAT
360-DEGREE TONING.
THE KEY IS YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BEND YOUR BACK OVER TO WORK
THE ABS.
YOU SIMPLY TWIST YOUR TORSO
TO ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER.
COMPARE THIS TO THE CRUNCHES ON
ONE OF THOSE EXERCISE BALLS.
THOSE ARE SO HARD TO USE AND
TO BALANCE ON.
EVEN SMALL, SHORT TWISTS LIKE
THIS ARE FIRING OFF AB MUSCLES
ACROSS THE CORE AND HERE IN
THE CENTER OF THE ABS AND ACROSS
THE ABDOMEN.
>> Gary: MAKE RED YOUR FAVORITE
COLOR, LIKE THESE WOMEN WHO TAKE
BODY SLIMMING VERY SERIOUSLY.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING...]
>> MANY OF THE MOVEMENTS
IN DANCE DO DEAL WITH
CIRCULAR MOVEMENT.
OUR DANCERS HAVE TO HAVE
THE SAME MOVEMENT THAT RED HAS
SO THAT THE BODY CAN MOVE
FORWARD, SIDE, BACK AND SIDE.
IT ELONGATES ALL THE MUSCLES
AROUND THE WAISTLINE AND IN
THE UPPER BACK AND THE,
AND THE SHOULDERS.
>> I DANCE AND WORK OUT FOUR TO
FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
RED IS A VERY EFFECTIVE MACHINE.
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY ABDOMINALS,
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY CORE AND
THE RESISTANCE THAT IT TAKES IS
ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT ON MY SPINE
OR MY NECK.
I THINK THE RESULTS YOU WOULD
GET WITH THIS MACHINE WOULD
CERTAINLY BE BENEFICIAL TO
A DANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE
STRETCHING AND HAVING RESISTANCE
AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE
BUILDING STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.
WITH RED, THIS IS VERY
COMFORTABLE TO DO.
I CAN PUT THIS IN MY DEN WHILE
MY KIDS ARE PLAYING AND
WATCH SHOWS WITH THEM AND
DO THIS WORKOUT.
RED IS DECEIVING 'CAUSE IF YOU
JUST LOOK AT IT, IT LOOKS LIKE
A STOOL.
I... WHEN I SAW IT, I SAID,
"WELL, WHERE IS THE MACHINE?"
AND THEY SAID,
"IT'S RIGHT THERE."
AND I SAID, "WHERE?"
AND THEY SAID, "RIGHT THERE,
THAT RED... THE RED IS
THE MACHINE."
AND I SAID, "WELL, HOW DOES
IT WORK?"
IT AND YOU GO SIDE TO SIDE,"
AND IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND IT IS
NOT DIFFICULT, ALTHOUGH
IT'S EFFECTIVE.
I CAN TOTALLY FEEL IT.
I DO LIKE RED.
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT RED,
I THINK IT'S A GREAT MACHINE.
I THINK THAT IT'S SO SMALL AND
IT'S EASY TO FIT IN YOUR HOME.
IT WON'T TAKE UP ROOM.
I THINK... MOSTLY, I THINK
THE RESULTS THAT I'M GOING
TO SEE ARE GONNA BE FANTASTIC.
>> MOST PEOPLE STOP USING
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY
FIND WORKING OUT UNCOMFORTABLE.
THEY GET DISCOURAGED AND QUIT.
BUT WITH RED, WE GUARANTEE
THAT IT'S THE MOST COMFORTABLE
WORKOUT THAT YOU MAY
EVER EXPERIENCE.
THERE'S NO IMPACT ON THE JOINTS,
AND BEST OF ALL, RED'S SMOOTH
MOVEMENT WORKS OUT YOUR CORE
ABDOMINALS THOROUGHLY.
YOU COULD BE BURNING HUNDREDS OF
CALORIES AND SLIMMING DOWN YOUR
MIDSECTION WHILE WATCHING YOUR
FAVORITE TV SHOW, AND YOU WON'T
HAVE TO CRANK UP THE SOUND
BECAUSE RED IS VIRTUALLY SILENT,
NOT LIKE THOSE NOISY TREADMILLS
AND CARDIO BIKES.
RED IS THE COMFORTABLE WAY
TO SLIM DOWN, AND TALKING ABOUT
SLIM, RED DOES NOT TAKE UP
AN ENTIRE ROOM LIKE OTHER BULKY
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT.
USE IT IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR
BEDROOM OR IN THE DEN, AND WHEN
YOU'RE DONE, RED STORES UNDER
YOUR BED IN SECONDS.
RED IS THAT ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
EXERCISE MACHINE THAT'S
COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO USE.
IT'S A SERIOUS WORKOUT THAT'S
EASY ON YOUR BODY.
RED GETS RESULTS.
>> I LOST SEVEN AND A HALF
INCHES OFF MY WAIST IN
EIGHT WEEKS.
THAT'S ALMOST AN INCH A WEEK.
THESE ARE MY OLD PANTS.
AND... THEY'RE HUGE!
I USED TO... I FIT IN THESE
EIGHT WEEKS AGO.
THIS MEANS MORE THAN A SCALE
WILL EVER MEAN, WHEN YOU CAN
GRAB YOUR PANTS... AND DO THAT,
AND KNOW THAT... THEY'RE HUGE.
YOU CAN'T WEAR THEM ANYMORE.
THESE ARE PRETTY
DRAMATIC RESULTS.
THE BEST PART OF THIS IS
WHEN PEOPLE NOTICE.
THEY SAY, "YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT!"
AND THAT'S SO EXCITING
TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY.
>> I LOST FIVE AND A HALF INCHES
OFF MY HIPS, NINE INCHES OFF
MY WAIST, ALL THAT USING RED.
AND ALL THAT WITHIN TWO MONTHS.
NINE INCHES AROUND MY WAIST IS
A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ME
BECAUSE BEFORE, IT JUST,
LIKE, STAYED THERE...
I'LL LOSE THE WEIGHT,
BIGGER ON THE WAIST.
BUT NOW WITH RED, THAT'S GONE.
THESE PANTS USED TO FIT
FAIRLY WELL.
THEY WERE NICE AND COMFORTABLE.
IT LOOKS LIKE A CLOWN OUTFIT.
NOW, I CAN'T EVEN WEAR
THESE ANYMORE.
I MEAN, IT'S HUGE... I MEAN,
TO THE POINT WHERE IF I DON'T
WEAR A BELT, THEY PRETTY MUCH,
LIKE, FALL DOWN TO MY ANKLE.
AND ALL THIS BECAUSE OF RED.
I'M ECSTATIC ABOUT IT, ACTUALLY.
>> WRITE DOWN THIS PHONE NUMBER
AND CALL RIGHT NOW AND PUT AN
EXCITING NEW SPIN ON YOUR ABS
WORKOUT WITH RED.
IT'S HOT, IT WORKS.
>> Announcer: ARE YOU TIRED OF 
CONSTANTLY FIGHTING THAT GROWING
MIDSECTION OR HAVE YOU GIVEN UP
ON THOSE LESS-THAN-LOVEABLE LOVE
HANDLES AND FLABBY POOCH AREA?
ENDLESS CRUNCHES ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE AND STRAIN
THE NECK AND BACK, PLUS
WHO REALLY HAS TIME TO GO
TO THE GYM?
YOU MAY HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED
EXPENSIVE LIPOSUCTION,
COSTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
JUST TO GET IN SHAPE.
>> I FIGHT THE POOCH.
>> THE POOCH, THE POUCH--
I CALL IT "THE POUCH."
>> BEER BELLY, WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO CALL IT... BUDDHA ON YOUR
STOMACH, RIGHT IN THE FRONT.
>> FAT IN THE ABDOMINAL AREA IS
THE HARDEST TO WORK ON.
>> I HATE TO WORK OUT AND I HATE
TO DO ABS BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL.

WAISTLINE IN CONTINUOUS,

WE WANTED TO INTRODUCE RED TO
THE TOUGHEST GROUP WE COULD
THINK OF... A GROUP OF
FIREFIGHTERS.
THESE GUYS KNOW ALL ABOUT USING
EQUIPMENT TO GET A JOB DONE.
AT FIRST, THEY WERE SKEPTICAL...
>> THERE IS NOTHING MORE BORING
IN THE WORLD THAN WORKING OUT.
>> REAL TEST IS TO GET IT
PAST US.
WE TEND TO BE HARD ON STUFF.
>> Announcer: ...UNTIL THEY
TRIED IT.
>> FEELS GOOD.
>> IT'S PRETTY SOLID.
>> IT'S REALLY SMOOTH.
IT MOVES VERY EASILY.
IT'S PRETTY COOL. [CHUCKLES]
>> I WEIGH 250 POUNDS.
THIS IS SUPPORTING ME JUST FINE.
>> ONCE YOU GET GOING, YOU CAN
START FEELING IT.
ON THE SIDES, DEFINITELY.
>> HOO, THERE IT IS!
>> YEAH, YOU CAN FEEL IT
BURNING RIGHT HERE.
>> WELL, I'M FEELING IT IN
MY LOWER ABS, AND I'M ALSO
FEELING IT IN MY OBLIQUES.
[GEAR CRANKS]
>> THE CORE AND ALL THE WAY IN
TO THE BACK, YOU CAN FEEL IT.
THE MORE YOU DO IT, YOU START
FEELING THE BURN.
IT FEELS GOOD.
>> SEE, I CAN, I CAN FEEL IT
HERE BUT I CAN ALSO FEEL IT
A LITTLE MORE IN MY HIPS, TOO.
IT'LL BE A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> YOU CAN GET A GOOD WORKOUT
OUT OF THIS.
>> IT'S A NICE,
LOW-IMPACT WORKOUT.
I CAN BORROW IT FOR ABOUT SIX
WEEKS, SEE HOW... [LAUGHTER]
>> IT IS QUICK, YOU KNOW,
AND IT DOES DO ALL THE THINGS
THAT THEY'RE SAYING.
>> Man: SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ON
TO SOMETHING, MAN.
[...]
>> TOP FITNESS TRAINERS HAVE
KNOWN ABOUT THE CORE SCULPTING
POWER OF ROTATIONAL EXERCISES
FOR YEARS, BUT IT'S BEEN HARD
TO DO UNTIL NOW.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO FITNESS
PROFESSIONALS THINK OF RED?
WE TOOK IT TO SOME OF AMERICA'S
FINEST TRAINERS AND EXERCISE
PHYSIOLOGISTS AND ASKED
FOR THEIR OPINIONS.
>> I LOVE RED.
IT'S DONE A LOT FOR MY BACK AND
NECK, AND IT'S HELPED MY CORE
STRENGTH TREMENDOUSLY.
THE RESULTS I'VE SEEN... UH,
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED
RED HAVE BEEN TRULY AMAZING.
IT'S THE BEST ABDOMINAL
EXERCISER I HAVE EVER USED.
>> SO WITH RED, YOU'RE GETTING
ALL AREAS OF THE ABS.
YOU'RE GETTING THE OBLIQUES,
YOU'RE GETTING THE UPPER AB, YOU
GET THE LOWER AB, YOU'RE GETTING
THE WHOLE CENTRAL ABDOMINAL
MUSCLES, NOT JUST STRICTLY
ISOLATING ONE SMALL SECTION LIKE
THE OLD-FASHIONED AB CRUNCHERS
WHERE YOU'RE JUST COMING
STRAIGHT FORWARD AND BACK DOWN.
SO YOU BASICALLY GET A FULL
ABDOMINAL WORKOUT, HITTING
ALL AREAS OF YOUR AB MUSCLES
WITH RED.
>> WELL, WE'RE RAISING OUR HEART
RATE, WE'RE HELPING TO CIRCULATE
AND STIMULATE THE BLOOD FLOW.
I THINK RED WOULD WORK FOR
JUST ABOUT ANYONE.
>> RED IS GREAT FOR THE LOWER
ABS, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN.
UM, A LOT OF CLIENTS THAT
I HAVE WHO'VE HAD BABIES,
THIS IS GREAT.
IT REALLY GETS DEEP IN THERE,
WORKS THE CORE MUSCLES OF
THE LOWER PART OF THE ABS.
RED IS EASY.
YOU'LL GET YOUR RESULTS.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL IT IN
MY ABDOMINALS, AND I CAN ALSO
FEEL IT IN MY ARMS.
I WORK OUT ALL THE TIME AND
I CAN FEEL THIS MORE
THAN ANYTHING.
DOES IT WORK? ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE KEYS TO RAPID RESULTS ARE
A FULL RANGE OF MOTION AND USING
RESISTANCE TRAINING.
RED INVOLVES ALL OF YOUR CORE
ABDOMINAL MUSCLES TO GET THAT
RICH RANGE OF MOTION THAT
DELIVERS RESULTS.
AS YOU ROTATE ON RED,
YOUR ABS AND CORE MUSCLES
ARE BEING ACTIVATED--
FROM THE HIPS AND BACK TO
OBLIQUES TO CENTER ABS TO
OBLIQUES AND THEN YOUR BACK.
THAT'S 360 DEGREES OF CORE
ABDOMINAL TONING THAT'S
WHITTLING DOWN YOUR WAISTLINE.
>> Gary: AND WHEN RESISTANCE IS
ADDED TO THE FORMULA, THE
RESULTS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
>> BEFORE I STARTED RED, I WAS
FLABBY AND NASTY. [LAUGHS]
I WOULD WEAR BULKY CLOTHES.
AFTER USING RED AND LOSING
THE INCHES AND THE WEIGHT, I
WEAR CLOTHES THAT, YOU KNOW, FIT
ME, THAT SHOW OFF MY BODY AND IT
GOT MY WAIST DOWN SIX INCHES.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> MY STOMACH WAS HUGE.
IT WAS HUGE.
IT WAS, UH, JUST KIND
OF DISGUSTING.
WHEN I USE RED FITNESS, I,
I CAN JUST FEEL IT RIGHT...
I CAN FEEL IT AND I KNOW
IT'S WORKING.
THESE RESULTS FROM USING RED
FITNESS WERE GREAT.
>> WHY HAVEN'T EXERCISE MACHINES
KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES IN TERMS
OF COMFORT?
OUR CAR SEATS, OUR HOME AND
OFFICE FURNITURE-- EVERYTHING
TODAY IS BUILT TO BE COMFORTABLE
EXCEPT FITNESS MACHINES.
>> LET'S FACE IT: A LOT OF
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT ISN'T EASY
FOR BIGGER PEOPLE TO USE.
BUT RED'S PADDED MEMORY FOAM
SEAT CUSHION IS EXTRA WIDE AND
IT'S SOFT AND COMFY.
WHEN THE EXERCISE IS EASY
ON YOUR BODY, YOU CAN
CONCENTRATE ON WORKING OUT
WITHOUT DISTRACTION AND
WITHOUT DISCOMFORT.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO REGULAR
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT RED?
WELL, WE TOOK IT TO 
LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA
TO FIND OUT.
>> THIS IS CUSHIONY, DOES NOT
HURT YOUR BUTT LIKE SITTING ON
A WOOD FLOOR.
>> YOU GOT A LOT OF "CUSH"...
A CUSH FOR THE TUSH. [LAUGHS]
>> YOU COULD SIT HERE AND WATCH
TV WHILE YOU DO IT. [LAUGHS]
>> WOW, THIS FEELS GREAT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S WORKING ALL OF
THE RIGHT MUSCLES.
>> I'M FEELING IT HERE...
AND DOWN LOWER, TOO.
>> I'M STARTING TO FEEL
THE BURN.
>> I'M FEELING THIS BURN HERE
PRETTY FAST DOING THIS.
>> Man: YEAH, IT'S WORKING,
I CAN FEEL IT.
>> YOU CAN FEEL 'EM FLEXING AND
TIGHTENING RIGHT HERE IN
THE FRONT AND THEN ON THE SIDES.
>> I FEEL IN MY LOWER STOMACH.
>> I FEEL IT IN MY STOMACH.
>> MY STOMACH, RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE. >> HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT AROUND,
RIGHT AROUND HERE.
ON THE SIDES DOWN HERE.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL HOW IT
ISOLATES THE MUSCLES.
>> THAT LOWER, VERY LOWER AB.
>> I REALLY LIKE IT.
IT'S GOOD.
>> IT'S VERY GOOD.
>> IT'S EASY TO DO,
IT'S COMFORTABLE.
I LIKE IT, IT JUST FEELS GOOD.
>> YOU FEEL IT ALL THE WAY
AROUND YOUR WAIST, YOU FEEL IT
DOWN THE FRONT.
'CAUSE YOU CAN TELL
I'M BREATHING. [LAUGHS]
IT'S A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOING
TO GET MY SIX PACK BACK.
>> RED'S EASY ON YOUR BODY AND
IT'S ALSO EASY TO USE.
YOUR BACK REMAINS STRAIGHT AND
RELAXED BECAUSE THE VERTEBRAE IN
YOUR BACK ARE IN THE IDEAL,
RELAXED NEUTRAL POSITION.
YOU GRAB HOLD OF THE HANDLES
WHICH ADJUST TO MATCH YOUR ARM
LENGTH, AND NOW YOU JUST ROTATE
RIGHT AND LEFT AND RIGHT
AND LEFT.
AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN YOUR
ROTATION, DIFFERENT ABS AND CORE
MUSCLES ARE RECRUITED,
SO BY DOING ONE FULL REP,
YOU TONE AND STRENGTHEN ALL YOUR
CORE MUSCLES.
YOU'VE TONED YOUR WAISTLINE
ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR THAT
360-DEGREE TONING.
THE KEY IS YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BEND YOUR BACK OVER TO WORK
THE ABS.
YOU SIMPLY TWIST YOUR TORSO
TO ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER.
COMPARE THIS TO THE CRUNCHES ON
ONE OF THOSE EXERCISE BALLS.
THOSE ARE SO HARD TO USE AND
TO BALANCE ON.
EVEN SMALL, SHORT TWISTS LIKE
THIS ARE FIRING OFF AB MUSCLES
ACROSS THE CORE AND HERE IN
THE CENTER OF THE ABS AND ACROSS
THE ABDOMEN.
>> Gary: MAKE RED YOUR FAVORITE
COLOR, LIKE THESE WOMEN WHO TAKE
BODY SLIMMING VERY SERIOUSLY.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING...]
>> MANY OF THE MOVEMENTS
IN DANCE DO DEAL WITH
CIRCULAR MOVEMENT.
OUR DANCERS HAVE TO HAVE
THE SAME MOVEMENT THAT RED HAS
SO THAT THE BODY CAN MOVE
FORWARD, SIDE, BACK AND SIDE.
IT ELONGATES ALL THE MUSCLES
AROUND THE WAISTLINE AND IN
THE UPPER BACK AND THE,
AND THE SHOULDERS.
>> I DANCE AND WORK OUT FOUR TO
FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
RED IS A VERY EFFECTIVE MACHINE.
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY ABDOMINALS,
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY CORE AND
THE RESISTANCE THAT IT TAKES IS
ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT ON MY SPINE
OR MY NECK.
I THINK THE RESULTS YOU WOULD
GET WITH THIS MACHINE WOULD
CERTAINLY BE BENEFICIAL TO
A DANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE
STRETCHING AND HAVING RESISTANCE
AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE
BUILDING STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.
WITH RED, THIS IS VERY
COMFORTABLE TO DO.
I CAN PUT THIS IN MY DEN WHILE
MY KIDS ARE PLAYING AND
WATCH SHOWS WITH THEM AND
DO THIS WORKOUT.
RED IS DECEIVING 'CAUSE IF YOU
JUST LOOK AT IT, IT LOOKS LIKE
A STOOL.
I... WHEN I SAW IT, I SAID,
"WELL, WHERE IS THE MACHINE?"
AND THEY SAID,
"IT'S RIGHT THERE."
AND I SAID, "WHERE?"
AND THEY SAID, "RIGHT THERE,
THAT RED... THE RED IS
THE MACHINE."
AND I SAID, "WELL, HOW DOES
IT WORK?"
IT AND YOU GO SIDE TO SIDE,"
AND IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND IT IS
NOT DIFFICULT, ALTHOUGH
IT'S EFFECTIVE.
I CAN TOTALLY FEEL IT.
I DO LIKE RED.
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT RED,
I THINK IT'S A GREAT MACHINE.
I THINK THAT IT'S SO SMALL AND
IT'S EASY TO FIT IN YOUR HOME.
IT WON'T TAKE UP ROOM.
I THINK... MOSTLY, I THINK
THE RESULTS THAT I'M GOING
TO SEE ARE GONNA BE FANTASTIC.
>> MOST PEOPLE STOP USING
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY
FIND WORKING OUT UNCOMFORTABLE.
THEY GET DISCOURAGED AND QUIT.
BUT WITH RED, WE GUARANTEE
THAT IT'S THE MOST COMFORTABLE
WORKOUT THAT YOU MAY
EVER EXPERIENCE.
THERE'S NO IMPACT ON THE JOINTS,
AND BEST OF ALL, RED'S SMOOTH
MOVEMENT WORKS OUT YOUR CORE
ABDOMINALS THOROUGHLY.
YOU COULD BE BURNING HUNDREDS OF
CALORIES AND SLIMMING DOWN YOUR
MIDSECTION WHILE WATCHING YOUR
FAVORITE TV SHOW, AND YOU WON'T
HAVE TO CRANK UP THE SOUND
BECAUSE RED IS VIRTUALLY SILENT,
NOT LIKE THOSE NOISY TREADMILLS
AND CARDIO BIKES.
RED IS THE COMFORTABLE WAY
TO SLIM DOWN, AND TALKING ABOUT
SLIM, RED DOES NOT TAKE UP
AN ENTIRE ROOM LIKE OTHER BULKY
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT.
USE IT IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR
BEDROOM OR IN THE DEN, AND WHEN
YOU'RE DONE, RED STORES UNDER
YOUR BED IN SECONDS.
RED IS THAT ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
EXERCISE MACHINE THAT'S
COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO USE.
IT'S A SERIOUS WORKOUT THAT'S
EASY ON YOUR BODY.
RED GETS RESULTS.
>> I LOST SEVEN AND A HALF
INCHES OFF MY WAIST IN
EIGHT WEEKS.
THAT'S ALMOST AN INCH A WEEK.
THESE ARE MY OLD PANTS.
AND... THEY'RE HUGE!
I USED TO... I FIT IN THESE
EIGHT WEEKS AGO.
THIS MEANS MORE THAN A SCALE
WILL EVER MEAN, WHEN YOU CAN
GRAB YOUR PANTS... AND DO THAT,
AND KNOW THAT... THEY'RE HUGE.
YOU CAN'T WEAR THEM ANYMORE.
THESE ARE PRETTY
DRAMATIC RESULTS.
THE BEST PART OF THIS IS
WHEN PEOPLE NOTICE.
THEY SAY, "YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT!"
AND THAT'S SO EXCITING
TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY.
>> I LOST FIVE AND A HALF INCHES
OFF MY HIPS, NINE INCHES OFF
MY WAIST, ALL THAT USING RED.
AND ALL THAT WITHIN TWO MONTHS.
NINE INCHES AROUND MY WAIST IS
A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ME
BECAUSE BEFORE, IT JUST,
LIKE, STAYED THERE...
I'LL LOSE THE WEIGHT,
BIGGER ON THE WAIST.
BUT NOW WITH RED, THAT'S GONE.
THESE PANTS USED TO FIT
FAIRLY WELL.
THEY WERE NICE AND COMFORTABLE.
IT LOOKS LIKE A CLOWN OUTFIT.
NOW, I CAN'T EVEN WEAR
THESE ANYMORE.
I MEAN, IT'S HUGE... I MEAN,
TO THE POINT WHERE IF I DON'T
WEAR A BELT, THEY PRETTY MUCH,
LIKE, FALL DOWN TO MY ANKLE.
AND ALL THIS BECAUSE OF RED.
I'M ECSTATIC ABOUT IT, ACTUALLY.
>> WRITE DOWN THIS PHONE NUMBER
AND CALL RIGHT NOW AND PUT AN
EXCITING NEW SPIN ON YOUR ABS
WORKOUT WITH RED.
IT'S HOT, IT WORKS.

Jab! Foom!
The name of the workout is Turbo

You are jamming.

amazing before and after photos
are proof that Turbo Jam will

waistline, and firm and sculpt
your entire body.
>> male announcer: That's
because Turbo Jam is a
breakthrough approach to

All set to the most awesome
workout music you've ever heard.
>> female announcer: It's so
much fun, it doesn't even feel

Yet it's all designed to
deliver:
>> Turbo Jam is a program that's
gonna get you the results that
you've been wanting in the
places you've wanted them in the
quickest amount of time
possible.
The music's incredible.
The moves are easy.
And they get you the results you

>> Boom boom boom 
To the open room 
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
was created by world-renowned
fitness expert:
As a wife and working mother of
two, Chalene developed Turbo Jam
as a fitness solution that fit
into her own busy lifestyle.
Since then, Chalene has appeared
in more than 50 fitness videos.
She's become an international
fitness celebrity, a
sought-after health and fitness
writer, and:
>> male announcer: Now Chalene
has taken her red-hot health
club workout to an even higher
level and turned it into one of
the most effective video-based
weight loss and fitness programs
ever.
In fact, it's proven to:
And it's so effective, you're
guaranteed to lose up to 10
pounds and 10 inches in your
first 10 days or your money
back.
>> In 10 days, I've lost over
10 pounds and over 10 inches.
And overall, Turbo Jam's helped
me lose over 70 pounds and five
dress sizes.
>> female announcer: No matter
what your age or fitness level--
>> Turbo Jam is for everyone.
>> It doesn't matter what age
you are whether you are 12 or
60.
>> I love the music.
It's funky.
>> female announcer: Whether you
need to lose 5 pounds or 105
pounds, Turbo Jam is the answer.
>> Lost 15 pounds.
When from a size 10 to a size 6
and just feel completely
energized.
>> With Turbo Jam, I've lost 101
pounds, 10 inches in my waist,
gained an enormous amount of
energy.
>> female announcer: And
imagine, get an incredible ab
workout without ever getting
down on the floor to do
crunches.
>> You get an abdominal workout
without ever even hitting the
floor.
>> And it just really, honestly,
sucks everything in.
So you're getting tight abs
without having to lie on the
floor for 15 minutes and do
those old yucky crunches.
>> male announcer: Coming up,
you'll meet Chalene one-on-one,
and learn how her exciting new
program can help you drop the
unwanted pounds and inches and
transform your own body quickly
and easily.
>> female announcer: Best of
all, you can try Chalene's new
video-based program in the
privacy of your own home
risk-free for 30 days.
And get $60 worth of additional
DVDs and other bonuses as free
gifts just for trying Turbo Jam.
>> male announcer: So discover
for yourself how Turbo Jam can
help you transform your own body
in just minutes a day.
Get ready to rock your workout.
Get ready for:
>> female announcer: Thousands
of people from around the world
have already experienced
incredible results with Turbo
Jam.
That's because this fun,
innovative combination of
cardio, kickboxing, and dance
set to awesome music actually
makes losing weight fun.
Anyone can follow along and get
fast results.
In fact, you're guaranteed to
lose up to 10 pounds and 10
inches in your first 10 days.
But more importantly, this is a
program you'll want to keep
doing so you can shed all those
unwanted pounds and inches and
totally reshape your body.
>> Thanks to Turbo Jam, I have
lost 25 pounds, 10 1/2 inches
all over my body.
I went from a size 10.
Now I'm back into a size 6.
You will not feel like you're
exercising.
And you will see results.
I promise you.
>> I found Turbo Jam.
And I've lost 47 pounds.
And I was a size 10/12.
And now I'm sitting at a size 0.
>> It helped me to achieve the
results that I wanted that I was
not getting from other workouts,
that I was not getting from
weights, that I was not getting
from regular aerobics.
Before Turbo Jam, I was a size
12.
And my thighs were a lot bigger.
And once I started to do Turbo
Jam, I lost inches in my
thighs.
I've lost 50 pounds.
I'm now a size 6.
Turbo Jam is for anyone.
It's gonna really help your body
to get in shape.
And it doesn't take long either.
Just a few weeks and you can
notice a difference.
>> The secret to Turbo Jam is
turbo training, where I use
awesome music to lead you
through a series of high energy
bursts throughout your workout.
And I've combined that with my
Elite 11 moves that shape and
sculpt your upper body, your
lower body, and your core.
These are the moves that change
peoples' bodies.
And you won't see them in other
workouts.
They're really fun, they're
really simple, and they
concentrate, more than anything
else, on your waistline and your
abs.
Let me show you some of my Elite
11 moves.
This one's called the turbo
tuck.
And ladies, I promise you, it's
better than a tummy tuck.
'Cause you're actually gonna get
into a position that tightens
your abs.
And this is the foundation of
our Elite 11.
You're working the abs.
You're protecting the back.
And you're working the inner
thighs.
Now, you can see with the pump,
she's doing a crunch
the entire time.
It's like doing abs, but without
having to lay on the floor.
And how easy is that?
She's working the abs, she's
working the legs, she's working
the upper body, and anybody can
do this.
>> Single, single, double.
>> I love this move.
It's called the zig zag.
And as you can see, she's really
working her obliques.
I mean, this is incredible ab
work.
The legs, inner thigh, outer
thigh, and glutes.
We're lifting up the derriere at
the same time that we're working
the abs.
Now, in the twist--
Anyone can do this.
It's simple, jab, cross, jab,
knee.
When she lifts that knee
though--
Ergh!
Engaging the core.
So not only is she working the
abs, but she's lunging deep into
those legs and shaping every
area of the lower body.
Inner thigh, outer thigh,
glutes, and abs all at the same
time.
And talk about cardiovascular.
You breathing hard?
Whew!
It works.
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
may just look like a fun way to
work up a sweat.
But Chalene's breakthrough turbo
training method has actually
been scientifically proven to
burn fat and calories faster
than other cardio programs.
In fact, a major university
studied that calories burned by
popular exercise programs--
Like walking, strength training,
Pilates, step aerobics, and
running--
Turbo Jam beat them all with
an average 705 calories burned
per hour.
And some Turbo Jam participants
burned calories at a staggering
rate of over 1,000 calories an
hour.
So now you can maximize fat
loss, achieve flat, sexy abs,
and get guaranteed success.
>> Because of Turbo Jam, I was
able to lose 60 pounds, 10
inches from the waist.
And it never felt like exercise.
The music is the best music
you're ever gonna hear.
>> Music is a motivator.
I think it's primal, you know.
People have been moving to great
beats since the beginning of
time.
And it's that one thing that
at-home exercise programs have
been missing.
And this program has it.
Hook, down and up.
Imagine you're sliding your arm
across the top of a table.
>> It's different from other
home workouts.
It's really high energy.
The music is just slammin'.
>> Don't miss 
The party train 
>> The moves go right with the
music.
So everything goes well
together.
It's a perfectly choreographed,
um, program.
>> Look to the back, kick back.
>> Mama said knock you out 
>> It's a non-stop turbo party
from beginning to end.
And it just keeps the energy
level going, going, going, and
going until you don't stop.
>> Not only is it fun, you feel
like you're at a party, you feel
like you're not exercising--
But you're creating results.
You're really making your body
into a fat burning machine.
You're really sculpting your
body.
You're toning your body.
Um, it's--it's a great workout.
>> Boogie 
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
isn't just a collection of great
workout videos.
It's a complete weight loss and
body shaping system with
everything you need to burn off
the fat and sculpt a leaner,
sexier body in as little as 20

And you'll never have to starve
yourself to lose weight again,
because Chalene even includes
her step-by-step eating plan,
which gives you tons of
delicious meals, a dining out
guide, and her personal favorite
recipes.
>> It's real.
I can't sell ya a diet pill.
I don't want you to go have
surgery.
I want you to do it in a way
that's gonna change your life
and make you feel better.
And that's what this program
does.
>> At my heaviest, I was close
to 210.
Since I've started Turbo Jam,
I've lost 70 pounds.
I've gone down from a size 18 to
a size 6.
>> This person right now--
This is new.
I've always been big my entire
life.
When I started Turbo Jam, I was
a size 20.
Now I'm a size 6.
Lost 75 pounds.
And I just feel great.
Now I'm probably in the best
shape of my life.
>> With Turbo Jam, I've lost 101
pounds, 10 inches in my waist.
Look at that before photo.

was me.
And then you look at that after
photo, and this is someone who
has experienced firsthand the
power of the Turbo Jam workout.
So just give it a shot.
And you'll be amazed at what you

Didn't see that jab comin'.
I'm telling you, it's just
awesome.
>> And you wanna shake your
hips, you wanna move, you wanna
punch, you wanna kick.
You kick harder because the
energy of the music really gets
you going.
>> female announcer: Imagine
getting abs like these and you
don't even have to get on the
floor.
That's right.
No more crunches.
And no need for awkward ball
workouts.
No more ab machines.
Because with Turbo Jam, now you
can shrink your waistline,
flatten your tummy, and get
lean, sexy abs all while
standing up.
It's easy thanks to Turbo Jam's
exclusive Elite 11 moves.
>> These moves standing up work
your abs.
You burn the fat, and it's an
intensive workout.
With Turbo Jam, I lost 55
pounds.
I went from a size 40 to a 33.
And it's amazing.
>> female announcer: And when it
comes to abs, moms have it the
hardest.
But Turbo Jam is so effective,
it even helps moms get rid of
that post pregnancy pooch, proof
that anyone can get great abs
with Turbo Jam.
>> I've transformed head to toe.
With Turbo Jam, I've lost 62
pounds.
I've gone from a 22 to a size 7.
And it's amazing.
I've had two C-sections.
And they say, you know,
especially after the surgery,
it's really hard to get it back.
But the moves that they do--
You're not laying there on the
floor, doing abs for an hour.
You're moving around, having
fun.
And just every time you lift
your knee, every time you go
like this, you're getting your
whole core.
And I know I'm never gonna get
heavy again, just because I love
Turbo Jam.
I'm burning calories and having
fun.
>> I've had four kids.
And I'm 38 years old.
Every single time I have a baby,
I go back to Turbo Jam.
It's the only thing that gets me
back into shape.
I wouldn't do anything else.
>> Since starting Turbo Jam, I
lost 71 pounds.
I went from a size 20 to a size
8.
You don't have to sit on the
floor and crunch, you know,
1,000 abs a day.
You don't.
Because you're engaging your
core in every single move that
you're doing.
After having two babies and
doing this workout, this is what
it has done to my abs.
And my husband is more than
happy.
Cannot get him off me!
I can't!
>> female announcer: Whether
you're a new mom who wants flat
abs or anyone who wants to lose
weight fast, if you call to
order now, Chalene will include
her 10-day Turbo Slim Rapid
Results fitness and eating plan.
It's a guaranteed way to lose up
to 10 pounds and 10 inches in
your first 10 days or you get
your money back.
But to make that claim, Chalene
had to put the Turbo Slim plan
to the test.
And the results we saw were
astonishing.
In 10 days on the Turbo Slim
program, I lost 11 3/4 inches.
I could see huge differences in
my waist and my hips.
My abdominals are unbelievable.
Abs I've never had before.
>> In 10 days, I lost an inch
off my thighs, and 10 inches
overall.
>> During my first 10 days of
the Turbo Jam, I've lost over 10
1/2 inches.
>> In 10 days, I've lost over 7
inches and 10 pounds doing Turbo
Jam.
My husband even thought, "Oh,
come on."
And he can't believe it.
I mean, he's like, "Well go
try on that bikini now."
You can do it in 10 days.
>> male announcer: Incredible
results in just 10 days or your
money back.
This is an exclusive TV offer.
You must call while there's
still time to save one full
payment and get the free upgrade
to express delivery.
So call the toll free number
now.
>> female announcer: Thousands
of people around the world have
already discovered the weight
loss and body shaping secret of
Turbo Jam.
The key is turbo training.
With turbo training, you're
working your upper body, lower
body, and your abs all at the
same time, which is why you burn
so many calories.
In fact, you can burn up to a
staggering 1,000 calories an
hour.
Best of all, it's so much fun,
you forget you're working out.
So this time, you can stick with
your workout and get lasting
results.
What makes it both fun and
incredibly effective at burning
off fat is Chalene and her Elite
11 moves.
>> This move is called the
capoeira step.
Capoeira is a form of Brazilian
martial arts that's really hot
right now in the health clubs.
It's just like you're grabbing
an imaginary opponent and
throwing him off to the side.
So not only are you gonna burn
calories, but you're gonna burn
up some stress at the same time.
She's working the legs and
tightening and toning her abs.
You're gonna see the inches come
off your waistline like never
before.
The other exercise which we
borrowed from capoeira is called
the wheel.
Legs are in that low squatting
position.
And once you're ready and you've
got the strength, we can move
on to those advanced layers
where we go a little bit deeper
into the legs, really engage the
obliques.
You can see those abs working.
The inner thigh, the outer
thigh, the glutes.
It's a total body exercise.
You will get rid of your love
handles once and for all.
It's so exciting to see that
sparkle in people's eyes when
they go, "I'm in the best shape
of my life."
>> For the first time in my
life, I was referred to as the
"skinny girl".
Since beginning Turbo Jam, I've
lost 45 pounds, gone from a size
12 to a size 4 easily.
Turbo Jam got rid of my post
pregnancy stomach.
I now have a very lean stomach
that you can see my abdominals.
But in addition to that, my
waist is smaller.
My hips are smaller.
My arms look better, they're
more shapely.
I'm just much leaner overall.
Turbo Jam works.
I would recommend it to anyone
and everyone.
>> A friend of mine who started
the program just six months
ago--
She called and left a message on
my answering machine this week.
And she said, "This is a silly
message, but my pants are
falling down.
And I'm so happy.
And I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm so excited that my pants are
falling down today."
And so for me to, you know, to
give that joy to a friend, you
know, to a close friend who had
never tried my workout before,
and to see that it could give
her that same joy was--was
really rewarding.
>> 30 years I waited to wear a
bikini.
Turbo Jam gave me that feeling
of, you know what?
Look at this.
And I put on a bikini.
I lived the first half of my
life round.
I started moving, I started
punching.
And then I started noticing the
results.
I lost 60 pounds.
It's amazing.
Now I'm long.
Now I'm lean.
Now I have a tricep.
Now I've got obliques.
Now my legs are powerful and
sexy.
And I can see the muscles in my
legs.
Turbo Jam gave me this
opportunity.
And I want other people to feel
this.
>> You've seen how Turbo Jam has
helped the people in this show.
How they've changed their lives,
not with another fad or a
gimmick, but with a proven
program that delivers real
results.
A program they love so much,
they're still doing it years
later.
Now it's your turn.
In fact, I am so sure that
you're gonna love my program,
you can try it risk-free, 30
days.
And if you don't see amazing
results, I want you to send it
back.
We'll refund your money.
But I know after one workout,
you're gonna be hooked.
So what are you waiting for?
Pick up the phone and call.

WELCOME TO ICELAND HEALTH FORUM.
>> TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO BE
TALKING ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS SUFFER
FROM ON A DAILY BASIS:
JOINT PAIN, MUSCLE PAIN
AND CHRONIC PAIN.
>> IF YOU THINK THAT YOUR LIFE
HAS TO BE AN ENDURANCE TEST OF
PAIN, THERE'S SOMEONE HERE TODAY
TO TELL YOU THAT THOSE DAYS ARE
OVER BECAUSE THERE IS A SAFE,
GENTLE SOLUTION TO ARTHRITIS
PAIN, JOINT PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES,
SORENESS AND STIFFNESS.
>> HERE TO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT
IS RENOWN MEDICAL SPECIALIST,
AUTHOR AND NOTED EXPERT IN
THE FIELDS OF JOINT PAIN AND
ARTHRITIS, DR. GARRY GORDON.
WELCOME, DR. GORDON.
>> THANK YOU.
IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH
YOU ON ICELAND HEALTH FORUM.
>> NOW, DR. GORDON, WHAT CAUSES
JOINT PAIN AND STIFFNESS?
>> THE MAJOR CAUSE IS
INFLAMMATION IN THE JOINTS AND
INFLAMMATION IN THE MUSCLES.
INFLAMMATION IS THE MAIN REASON
YOU ACHE WHEN YOU MOVE ABOUT OR
EVEN DO EVERYDAY TASKS.
>> SO WHAT DO PEOPLE DO
TO RELIEVE THE INFLAMMATION?
>> UNFORTUNATELY, MANY PEOPLE
ARE TAKING PRESCRIPTION
PAIN RELIEVERS,
BUT THESE ARE VERY HARSH
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICINES.
THEY ARE EXTREMELY HARD ON
THE BODY, AND THE HEART
IN PARTICULAR.
WHILE THEY MAY REDUCE
THE INFLAMMATION, THEY ARE
ALSO LIABLE TO CAUSE A NUMBER
OF OTHER PROBLEMS INCLUDING
HEART ATTACK.
>> SO THE CURE CAN BE WORSE
THAN THE DISEASE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?
>> SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT
THEY ARE JUST DESTINED TO LIVE
WITH PAIN, AND THERE'S NOTHING
THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT.
I'M HERE TO TELL THEM THAT
TRUE RELIEF IS FINALLY AVAILABLE
AND IT'S SAFE, GENTLE
AND WORRY-FREE.
IT'S ICELAND HEALTH
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA.@@@@@@
>> UPON WAKING IN THE MORNING,
I HAD TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF
THE BED FOR FIVE TO 10 MINUTES
BEFORE STANDING UP... UH, SO
I'M MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE AND IT'S
JUST, UM, MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE
WAKING UP, FACING LIFE NOW.
>> WELL, I FEEL MORE FLEXIBLE,
AND I FEEL LIKE... [EXHALES]
MY BODY DOESN'T ACHE.
>> ICELAND HEALTH JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CERTAINLY HELPS THEM,
BUT WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT DO,
DR. GORDON?
>> ICELAND HEALTH JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA IS MADE BY THE SAME
PEOPLE WHO BRING YOU THE WORLD'S
BEST-SELLING BRAND OF OMEGA-3:
ICELAND HEALTH.
THEY'VE TAKEN THEIR
PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE OMEGA-3 AND
AFTER LONG AND EXTENSIVE
RESEARCH, THEY'VE DEVELOPED
A PROPRIETARY FORMULA THAT
CONTAINS OTHER POWERFUL NATURAL
INGREDIENTS THAT ARE KNOWN
TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION, INCREASE
JOINT LUBRICATION AND
FLEXIBILITY AND BUILD CARTILAGE.
>> WHAT DOES ICELAND HEALTH 
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA CONTAIN?
>> FIRST, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CONTAINS OMEGA-3.
IT IS MADE FROM DEEP-WATER
FISH CAUGHT IN THE COLD, CLEAR
WATERS AROUND ICELAND.
THIS MEANS THEY AREN'T TAINTED
WITH UNHEALTHY LEVELS OF DIOXIN,
PCBs, PESTICIDES AND MERCURY.
IF THE FISH ARE HEALTHIER,
THAT NATURALLY MEANS THE OMEGA-3
HAS TO BE BETTER.
AND JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS MADE
WITH OMEGA-3 THAT IS THE BEST
IN TERMS OF PURITY.
IN JOINT RELIEF FORMULA, ICELAND
HEALTH HAS COMBINED THEIR
OMEGA-3 WITH COLLAGEN II.
THIS IS WHAT MAKES UP MOVEABLE
JOINTS AND PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL
OF CHONDROITIN SULFATE,
AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THAT
IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF
JOINT TISSUE.
IT ALSO CONTAINS HYALURONIC
ACID, WHICH IS THE MAJOR
COMPONENT IN JOINT LUBRICATION
FLUID THAT CUSHIONS JOINTS.
THANKS TO THE COLLAGEN 2,
THE ENZYMES THAT DESTROY
THE PROTEIN IN THE CARTILAGE
FACE MAJOR RESISTANCE.
IT ALSO LESSENS INFLAMMATION
AND PROMOTES NEW
CARTILAGE SYNTHESIS.
IN ADDITION, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CONTAINS GLUCOSAMINE
WHICH PREVENTS CARTILAGE
DESTRUCTION, SWELLING AND
LOSS OF FLEXIBILITY.
>> SO HOW DO ALL OF THESE
INGREDIENTS WORK?
>> THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT.
LET'S LOOK AT THIS SCALE MODEL
OF A KNEE JOINT.
THE OMEGA-3 REDUCES INFLAMMATION
IN THE JOINTS RIGHT IN HERE.
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN
OMEGA-3 TO BE ONE OF
NATURE'S MOST POWERFUL
ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES.
THE COLLAGEN 2 THEN SERVES
AS BUILDING BLOCK FOR
YOUR MOVEABLE JOINTS.
ITS CHONDROITIN...
GIVES YOUR JOINTS ELASTICITY AND
IT ENHANCES THE MANUFACTURE OF
HYALURONIC ACID, WHICH IS
THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN
JOINT LUBRICATION FLUID.
ON TOP OF ALL THESE
RELIEVERS AND PROTECTORS
IS GLUCOSAMINE, WHICH IS
A GUARDIAN OF CARTILAGE.
TOGETHER, THIS NATURAL MATRIX OF
PAIN RELIEF REDUCES INFLAMMATION
THAT CAUSES PAIN AND PROVIDES
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SUPPORT
FOR JOINT CONNECTIVE TISSUE
TO PREVENT FURTHER PAIN.
SO IN ESSENCE,
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS
REPAIRING AND REPLENISHING.
>> AND I DON'T NEED
A PRESCRIPTION FOR ICELAND
HEALTH JOINT RELIEF FORMULA?
>> NOT AT ALL, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA IS COMPLETELY NATURAL
AND GENTLE, YET REMARKABLY
EFFECTIVE ON JOINT PAIN AND
MUSCLE PAIN AS WELL.
IN FACT, OVER TIME, ICELAND
HEALTH JOINT RELIEF FORMULA WILL
NATURALLY HELP YOU FEEL LESS AND
LESS PAIN BECAUSE THE CAUSES OF
THE PAIN ARE BEING ELIMINATED.
>> AND JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS
SAFER THAN VIOXX, BEXTRA,
CELEBREX, ALEVE AND THOSE TYPES
OF PRESCRIPTION PAIN RELIEVERS?
>> ICELAND HEALTH JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA IS TOTALLY SAFE.
NOT ONLY ARE YOU RELIEVING THE
PAIN, YOU'RE ALSO RELIEVING YOUR
ANXIETIES ABOUT PAIN RELIEVERS.
AND HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW: OMEGA-3 IN
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS NOT JUST
REDUCING INFLAMMATION BUT ALSO
REMOVING ARTERIAL PLAQUE AND
IMPROVING YOUR CIRCULATION.
SO IT'S PROTECTING YOUR HEART
WHILE IT'S RELIEVING PAIN.
>> SO IN ICELAND HEALTH JOINT
RELIEF FORMULA, YOU HAVE OMEGA-3
WHICH REDUCES INFLAMMATION AND
IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.
THERE'S COLLAGEN II WHICH
CONTAINS CHONDROITIN AND
HYALURONIC ACID, BOTH OF
WHICH ARE NATURAL SUBSTANCES
THAT IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF
YOUR JOINTS, AND GLUCOSAMINE,
WHICH PREVENTS CARTILAGE
DESTRUCTION, SWELLING AND LOSS
OF FLEXIBILITY.
>> VERY GOOD.
>> DOCTOR, UM, HOW ABOUT SPORTS
INJURIES-- THINGS LIKE MUSCLE
ACHES AND, UM, ACHING JOINTS?
>> GINGER NEEDS, UH, SOMETHING
FOR HER TENNIS ELBOW.
>> WELL,INGER, LOOK AT IT THIS
WAY-- IF ICELAND HEALTH JOINT
RELIEF FORMULA CAN BE EFFECTIVE
ON SEVERE JOINT PAIN, JUST
IMAGINE HOW WELL IT CAN WORK ON
EVERYDAY MUSCLE ACHES AS WELL AS
THE SORENESS YOU FEEL AFTER
WORKING OUT, OR IN YOUR CASE,
PLAYING A HARD GAME OF TENNIS.
>> BUT WILL IT IMPROVE
MY BACKHAND?
>> GINGER, TRY THIS.
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE
TO LOSE IS YOUR PAIN.
>> I HAD THE BEGINNINGS OF
ARTHRITIS IN MY RIGHT HAND.
I COULD BARELY PUT MY MAKEUP
ON... OR WRITE.
I WAS EVEN HAVING TROUBLE
TYPING ON THE COMPUTER.
THE ARTHRITIS HAS DISAPPEARED
INSIDE OF THREE MONTHS.
>> I'D DONE SOME DAMAGE TO
THE JOINT IN MY THUMB AND
I WAS GETTING TO WHERE
I COULDN'T, LITERALLY COULDN'T
PICK UP THINGS.
I MEAN, THE PAIN, BUT JUST
THE STRENGTH WASN'T THERE
BECAUSE WHATEVER I'VE DONE,
AND I HADN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO SEE A DOCTOR ABOUT IT.
SINCE I'VE TAKEN ICELAND
HEALTH, I, UH, HAVE SEEN
THE STRENGTH COME BACK.
IT SEEMS TO BE LITERALLY AS
STRONG AS THE OTHER ONE NOW.
>> MY WORKOUTS ARE
PRETTY INTENSE.
THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF TEARS IN
THE BODY BASE IN THE DIFFERENT
MOVEMENTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
DO MARTIAL ARTS.
I NOTICED A TREMENDOUS CHANGE
IN, IN THE WAY MY BODY FEELS.
MY BODY FEELS GREAT.
IT'S JUST LIKE PUTTING OIL
IN A CAR.

MORE INVIGORATED.

>> OH, THERE ARE BIG
DIFFERENCES IN PURITY.
ICELAND HEALTH IS FAMOUS FOR
THEIR OMEGA-3 BECAUSE
IT'S PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE.
PLUS, ALL HARMFUL MATERIALS
THAT MIGHT BE PRESENT SUCH AS
MERCURY, PCBs AND OTHER TOXINS
ARE COMPLETELY REMOVED.
>> SO NOT ONLY IS ICELAND
HEALTH JOINT RELIEF FORMULA
FAR SAFER THAN PRESCRIPTION
PAIN RELIEVERS, IT ALSO
CONTAINS PURE OMEGA-3?
>> CORRECT... IF YOU'RE TAKING
THE PUREST OMEGA-3 YOU CAN FIND,
THEN IT HELPS INCREASE
THE EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING
INFLAMMATION THAT CAUSES
JOINT PAIN.
>> WELL, IT MAKES SENSE TO ME,
BUT IS THERE ANY PROOF THAT
OMEGA-3 ACTUALLY REDUCES
INFLAMMATION AND RELIEVES PAIN?
>> LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE.
RENOWNED INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALL
REPORTED THAT OMEGA-3 IS A SAFE
WAY TO REDUCE JOINT PAIN,
PLUS REDUCE RISK OF CORONARY
HEART DISEASE AND BLOOD
CLOTTING, PROMOTE HEALTHY
HEART FUNCTION, AND SLOW
HARDENING OF THE ARTERIES.
BY REDUCING INFLAMMATION,
CHOLESTEROL IS LOWERED,
CIRCULATION IMPROVES AND HEART
ATTACKS ARE PREVENTED.
IN JOINT RELIEF FORMULA, ICELAND
HEALTH HAS COMBINED THEIR
OMEGA-3 WITH COLLAGEN II.
THIS IS WHAT MAKES UP MOVEABLE
JOINTS AND PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL
OF CHONDROITIN SULFATE, AN
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THAT IMPROVES
THE QUALITY OF JOINT TISSUE.
IT ALSO CONTAINS HYALURONIC ACID
WHICH IS THE MAJOR COMPONENT
IN JOINT LUBRICATION FLUID
THAT CUSHIONS JOINTS.
THANKS TO THE COLLAGEN II,
THE ENZYMES THAT DESTROY
THE PROTEIN IN CARTILAGE
FACE MAJOR RESISTANCE.
IT ALSO LESSENS INFLAMMATION
AND PROMOTES NEW
CARTILAGE SYNTHESIS.
IN ADDITION, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CONTAINS GLUCOSAMINE,
WHICH PREVENTS CARTILAGE
DESTRUCTION, SWELLING AND
LOSS OF FLEXIBILITY.
>> THE PAIN HAS
DEFINITELY SUBSIDED.
>> I HAVE FELT MORE
INVIGORATED, I HAVE HAD
A BETTER SENSE OF WELLNESS.
I'VE BEEN HAPPIER.
I'VE BEEN EXERCISING MORE,
WHICH MAKES ME FEEL HAPPIER.
>> AND OVER TIME, ICELAND HEALTH
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA WILL
NATURALLY HELP YOU FEEL LESS AND
LESS PAIN BECAUSE THE CAUSES OF
THE PAIN ARE BEING ELIMINATED.
>> THAT'S REMARKABLE.
>> I'D SAY IT'S AMAZING.
>> WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME IS THAT
MORE PEOPLE AREN'T TAKING IT.
>> WELL, ICELAND HEALTH JOINT
RELIEF FORMULA IS BRAND-NEW AND
HAS NEVER BEEN AVAILABLE IN
THE UNITED STATES UNTIL NOW.
>> IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT
HOW TO GET THIS REMARKABLE
PAIN RELIEF BEYOND PRESCRIPTION,
WATCH THIS.
>> I LIKE THE FACT THAT
IT'S COMING FROM ICELAND.
I FEEL THAT IT'S PROBABLY
A PLACE THAT HAS VERY
LITTLE POLLUTION, UM,
THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCT IS
A PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE.
>> MY HUSBAND WAS GETTING
ARTHRITIS IN HIS LEFT FOOT,
WHICH WAS A GREAT
PROBLEM BECAUSE HE'S
A LONG-DISTANCE BIKER.
IT WAS ALSO A GREAT PROBLEM
BECAUSE IT WAS A SOURCE OF
EMBARRASSMENT FOR ME BECAUSE
IF WE WERE TO GO OUT TO DINNER,
HE COULD ONLY WEAR A SLIPPER.
HE WANTED TO WEAR FLIP FLOPS
ON HIS LEFT FOOT.
AND I... HAVE NOTICED THAT SINCE
HE'S BEEN TAKING OMEGA-3, HE HAS
STARTED WEARING HIS SNEAKERS
AGAIN, WITH LACES, AND WHEN WE
WENT OUT TO DINNER THE OTHER
NIGHT, HE WAS ABLE TO WEAR A
HARD LEATHER SHOE WITH A BUCKLE.
ALSO, HIS ARTHRITIS, THE GREAT
PAIN THAT HE HAD IN HIS LEFT
FOOT HAS JUST ABOUT DISAPPEARED,
AND HE IS... WINNING RACES
FOR LONG-DISTANCE BIKING.
IT'S TRUE.
>> I'VE BEEN TAKING IT FOR SIX
MONTHS, AND HONESTLY, MOST OF
MY PAINS ARE GONE.
>> I'VE DEFINITELY NOTICED
A DIFFERENCE.
MY KNEE, UM, I HAVE LESS PAIN IN
MY KNEE AND I'M ABLE TO DANCE
A LOT MORE THAN I DID, LIKE,
A YEAR AGO, AND I DEFINITELY
FEEL THAT, YOU KNOW, I CAN DO
A MUCH FASTER PACE AND KEEP UP
WITH MY DANCING THAN I DID
PRIOR TO TAKING IT.
>> I'VE BEEN TAKING IT NOW FOR
ABOUT A MONTH, AND MY JOINTS
ARE DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY
MORE FLEXIBLE.
I CAN BEND OVER... NO PAIN IN
THE BACK ANYMORE, THE KNEES.
I, I DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND
THE PRODUCT.
>> MY ENERGY LEVEL IS GREAT,
I'M ABLE TO SWIM 50 LAPS EVERY
DAY IN THE POOL.
I COULDN'T DO THAT BEFORE.
>> I HAD SOME JOINT PAIN IN
MY KNEES... NOT VERY MUCH,
BUT GOING UP AND DOWN STAIRS,

IT'S WONDERFUL. [LAUGHS]

TRUST ME, ONCE YOU'VE
EXPERIENCED THE STRESS-FREE
LIVING OF WATERWOOD, YOU'LL WANT
TO STAY FOREVER.
>> ONCE YOU GOT UP HERE,
YOU REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO GO
BACK HOME.
>> THE BEAUTY IS JUST...
TO USE THE EXPRESSION OF
THE TEENAGERS NOW, "AWESOME."
[LAUGHS]
>> IN THE SPRING, THERE'S
THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT SHADES OF
GREEN, AND WE LOVE TO WATCH
THE LEAVES CHANGE, AND AMAZED
IN THE WINTERTIME WHEN YOU TAKE
YOUR WALK THAT YOU CAN SEE SO
FAR INTO THE FOREST.
>> I NEVER SAW STARS LIKE
I SEE THEM OUT HERE.
THEY ARE GORGEOUS.
>> WINDING IN AND OUT OF
THE TREES AND SITTING ALONG THE
BEAUTIFUL LAKE, THIS COMMUNITY
IS FAMOUS FOR ITS 18-HOLE
PETE DYE-DESIGNED GOLF COURSE.
WATERWOOD NATIONAL HAS SPENT
MOST OF THE LAST 25 YEARS RANKED
AMONG THE TOP TEXAS COURSES BY
DALLAS MORNING NEWS AND IS
CURRENTLY RATED AS ONE OF TEXAS'
TOP 10 RESORTS.
ALTHOUGH THE GOLF COURSE HERE
WILL LEAVE YOU BREATHLESS, THAT
IS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
LAKE LIVINGSTON RUNS ALONG
EIGHT MILES OF THIS
COMMUNITY'S SHORELINE.
NOT ONLY IS IT THE
SECOND-LARGEST LAKE IN TEXAS,
BUT ALSO HAS SOME OF THE BEST
FISHING ANYWHERE IN THE AREA.
AS YOU EXPLORE THE 52 TOTAL
MILES THIS LAKE OFFERS, YOU WILL
BE ABLE TO BOAT, TAKE OUT SOME
JET SKIS OR TRAVEL INTO A HIDDEN
COVE AND WATCH A BALD EAGLE SOAR
ABOVE YOU.
>> ONCE WE GOT HERE, WE BOUGHT
A WEEKEND PLACE, AND WE WERE
HERE FOR MAYBE A YEAR AND A HALF
AND WE DECIDED THAT WE JUST
HAD TO BE HERE FULL-TIME.
>> IT'S HILL COUNTRY, SO
THERE'S GREAT, GREAT HIKING.
THERE'S GREAT FISHING, BEING SO
CLOSE TO THE LAKE.
LAKE LIVINGSTON HAS KNOWN
SOME OF THE BEST, BEST FISHING
IN TEXAS.
>> THE BIRD-WATCHING AT
WATERWOOD IS JUST AS GOOD AS IT
GETS ANYWHERE IN EAST TEXAS AND
PERHAPS ANYWHERE IN THE SOUTH.
>> THE PELICANS ARE FLYING AND
THEY FILL THE SKY, AND WHEN THEY
GO ONE DIRECTION, ALL YOU SEE IS
WHITE, AND WHEN THEY TURN
THE OTHER DIRECTION,
YOU SEE BLACK.
IT'S AMAZING TO SEE, AND I LOOK
FOR 'EM EVERY YEAR.
>> WE HAVE A PRETTY ACTIVE
SOCIAL LIFE AT THE COUNTRY CLUB.
WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL "WIND DOWN"
ON FRIDAY AFTERNOONS.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A HAPPY HOUR,
AND EVERYBODY COMES UP THERE AND
WE HAVE A GREAT TIME.
>> WATERWOOD ITSELF IS A PLACE
WHERE YOU CAN EITHER BE A LONER
OR YOU CAN BE A JOINER.
IT'S PEACEFUL, IT'S CALM.
MOST PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEY COME
TO WATERWOOD THE FIRST TIME THAT
IT'S SO PEACEFUL, AND IT IS.
BUT... YOU CAN BE AS ACTIVE
AS YOU WANT TO BE.
>> THE SECRET'S OUT--

I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS
ANYTHING THIS AREA HAS TO OFFER,
SO LET ME QUICKLY SUM UP A FEW
OF THE MUST-SEE DESTINATIONS

HOUSTON IS THE NATION'S
FOURTH-LARGEST CITY, SECOND
ONLY TO NEW YORK IN FORTUNE 500
HEADQUARTERS, AND HOME TO
THE TEXAS MEDICAL CENTER AND
NASA'S JOHNSON SPACE CENTER.
>> FROM WATERWOOD NATIONAL,
YOU CAN GET TO THE CITY OF
HOUSTON IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND
A HALF, AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT
HOUSTON IS YOU CAN DO SEVERAL
DIFFERENT THINGS.
I MEAN, WE HAVE THE HOUSTON
ASTROS, WHO JUST WENT TO
THE WORLD SERIES, WE HAVE
THE TEXANS, THE FOOTBALL TEAM,
WE HAVE HOCKEY, YOU HAVE A LOT
OF CULTURE, YOU HAVE THE ARTS,
UM, WONDERFUL DINING, UM...
THERE'S JUST SO MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS YOU CAN DO.
>> THERE'S ANYTHING YOU
WANT THERE.
THE WOODLANDS MALL, WHICH IS
ONLY... THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS, IS
ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR FROM HERE,
A LITTLE BIT LESS, AND IT IS
BECOMING THE SAME THING.
THEY'RE GONNA BE BUILDING
THEATERS THERE, AND THEY HAVE
A WONDERFUL MALL, AND THEY HAVE
A GREAT NEW MARKET AREA,
THEY HAVE TONS OF
WONDERFUL RESTAURANTS.
AND... IT'S A REALLY HAPPENING
PLACE-- THEY'RE GONNA MAKE
THAT MALL INTO A BOUTIQUE MALL
TO ATTRACT FOREIGN VISITORS,
SO IT'S GONNA HAVE A LOT TO
OFFER IN ALL DIFFERENT THINGS.
>> LOCATED ONLY A SHORT 30 MILES
FROM WATERWOOD, THE HISTORIC
CITY OF HUNTSVILLE IS HOME TO
SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY,
THE SAM HOUSTON MUSEUM,
HUNTSVILLE STATE PARK AND MANY
OTHER ATTRACTIONS.
ONE OF THE OLDEST TOWNS IN
TEXAS, THE HISTORIC HUNTSVILLE
DOWNTOWN AREA IS FULL OF
HISTORY, SHOPPING
AND ENTERTAINMENT.
WITH OVER 40 RETAIL SHOPS AND
RESTAURANTS AND 20 REGISTERED
HISTORIC SITES, YOU WILL FIND
ALL THE CONVENIENCES YOU COULD
EVER POSSIBLY NEED HERE.
FROM SHOPPING MALLS TO A 67-FOOT
STATUE OF THE LEGENDARY TEXAN,
SAM HOUSTON, YOU WILL NEVER BE
BORED WITH ALL THE HISTORY

TO OFFER.
>> HUNTSVILLE'S NOT FAR AWAY.
YOU KNOW, IT'S, HUNTSVILLE'S
WHERE SAM HOUSTON
STATE UNIVERSITY IS.
YOU'RE NOT TOO AWFULLY FAR
FROM BRYAN-COLLEGE STATION
OR TEXAS A&M.
IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE FINEST
SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY IF YOU
WANT TO SEE GREAT FOOTBALL.
UH, THEN THERE'S SMALLER TOWNS
AROUND-- COLDSPRING IS A QUAINT
LITTLE, I THINK IT'S THE COUNTY
SEAT, JUST... WITH ANTIQUE SHOPS

WATERWOOD ATTRACTS GOLFERS AND
TOURISTS YEAR-ROUND WHO COME
TO ENJOY THE COUNTLESS
OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECREATION.
THE SUNNY WEATHER IS PERFECT FOR
GOLF NEARLY 365 DAYS A YEAR.
PETE DYE CREATED THE COURSE WITH
THE GOAL OF BRINGING OUT
THE BEST GAME FOR ALL LEVELS
OF GOLFERS.
THE CLIFFS, THE 14th HOLE
ON THE COURSE, IS RANKED
BY GOLF DIGEST AS ONE OF THE
BEST 36 HOLES IN AMERICA.
THE HIGH DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY
PLACES WATERWOOD AMONG THE
50 MOST DIFFICULT COURSES IN
AMERICA AND CREATES A GOLF GAME
THAT YOU WILL NEVER FORGET.
>> IF YOU WANTED TO REALLY
DESCRIBE WATERWOOD NATIONAL,
IT'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST GOLF
COURSES ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.
PETE DYE IS NOTORIOUS FOR
BUILDING TOUGH GOLF COURSES.
AND WHEN IT FIRST OPENED, IT HAD
THE HIGHEST SLOPE RATING--
THAT'S THE WAY THEY MEASURE
THE TOUGHNESS OF A GOLF COURSE--
OF ANY COURSE IN THIS PART OF
THE COUNTRY.
>> IT'S EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT,
YET IT'S NOT EXCEPTIONALLY LONG.
THE SHOT-MAKING IS
SO CRITICAL.
AN ERRANT SHOT IS VERY HARD TO
RECOVER FROM, SO YOU HAVE TO
STAY FOCUSED AND CONCENTRATED
ALL THE TIME.
THERE ARE NO EASY HOLES ON
THE GOLF COURSE.
IT JUST, IT JUST BRINGS OUT
EVERY SHOT IN YOUR BAG, AND IT'S
JUST A WONDERFUL PLACE TO PLAY.
>> MY FAVORITE HOLE AT WATERWOOD
NATIONAL IS 13.
IT'S CALLED "THE HORIZON HOLE."
WHEN YOU COME OVER...
WHEN YOU TEE OFF,
YOU CAN'T SEE THE GREEN, BUT YOU
CAN SEE THE LAKE, AND THEN AFTER
YOU HIT YOUR TEE SHOT, YOU START
DOWN TOWARDS THE LAKE, AND THE
SCENERY ACROSS THE LAKE IS ONE
OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS
ANYWHERE AROUND.
>> FOLLOWED BY HOLE 14, WHICH IS
THE CLIFFS.
IT'S A PAR THREE, 227 FROM
THE TIPS, INTO THE WIND,
ALL OVER WATER, INTO A VERY
SMALL TARGET GREEN.
JUST GORGEOUS, SOME OF THE BEST,
BEST TWO HOLES IN AMERICA.
>> TWO YEARS AGO, WE HAD A GUY
COME AND PLAY MY TOURNAMENT
FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
HE INSTANTLY BOUGHT A LOT AND
BUILT A HOUSE WITHIN A YEAR.
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST, HE WAS THAT
IMPRESSED WITH THE PLACE.
>> IT'S VERY CHALLENGING.
I MEAN, SOME OF THE BEST GOLFERS
NOW PLAYING THE GAME HAVE GOT
THEIR TOUR CARDS ON THIS
PARTICULAR COURSE AND HAVE LIVED
TO TELL EVERYONE THAT IT'S A
VERY TOUGH, CHALLENGING COURSE.
>> GOLF IS NOT ALL THIS
COMMUNITY HAS TO OFFER.
WATERWOOD IS NESTLED ALONG EIGHT
MILES OF PRISTINE SHORELINE
ON LAKE LIVINGSTON, THE
SECOND-LARGEST LAKE IN TEXAS.
ENDLESS WATER RECREATION AWAITS
YOU-- BOATING, WATERSKIING,
JET SKIING, FISHING.
OH, AND I DO MEAN GREAT FISHING.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FISHING
LAKES IN TEXAS, KNOWN FOR
ITS FEISTY BASS AND
TEXAS-SIZE CATFISH.
AND THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM
TO STRETCH OUT ON THIS LAKE.
IN FACT, YOU HAVE 90,000 ACRES
TO EXPLORE.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE,
THAT IS 52 MILES OF LAKE WITH
450 MILES OF SHORELINE.
THEY SAY EVERYTHING IS BIGGER
IN TEXAS, AND, WELL, THIS
CERTAINLY PROVES THAT.
GET READY TO RELAX, UNWIND AND
ENJOY WATERWOOD ALONG BEAUTIFUL
LAKE LIVINGSTON.
>> THE PRIMARY THING THAT MAKES
WATERWOOD SO UNIQUE IS THAT
LAKE LIVINGSTON IS SO QUIET.
UNLIKE OTHER LAKES, WHERE YOU
HAVE HORRENDOUS BOAT TRAFFIC,
THERE'S HARDLY ANY BOAT TRAFFIC
HERE, EVEN ON HOLIDAYS.
>> LAKE LIVINGSTON IS
A FISHERMAN'S PARADISE.
HOW DO I KNOW?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I SEE
THE FISHERMEN BRINGING THE FISH
IN, BUT ECOLOGICALLY--
AND I'M AN ECOLOGIST--
WHEN YOU SEE BIRDS THAT FISH FOR
A LIVING, AND THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY THEY CAN FEED THEIR
FAMILIES, AND THERE ARE
THOUSANDS OF THEM AND SOMETIMES
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM,
AND THEY'RE ALL BIG AND FAT AND
HEALTHY, THEN YOU KNOW THAT
THIS IS A HEALTHY LAKE AND
A HEALTHY ECOSYSTEM.
>> LAKE LIVINGSTON HAS KNOWN
SOME OF THE BEST FISHING
IN TEXAS.
>> YOU'RE GONNA CATCH SOME
CATFISH THAT ARE BIGGER THAN
YOUR WIFE.
>> THERE'S YET ANOTHER REASON
THAT YOU WILL WANT TO BUY YOUR
HOME SITE HERE AT WATERWOOD--
THE GROWTH.
THIS GOLF AND LAKE RESORT
COMMUNITY IS LOCATED IN
SAN JACINTO COUNTY, ONE OF
THE FASTEST-GROWING COUNTIES IN
THE STATE OF TEXAS.
IN FACT, THE COUNTY'S POPULATION
GREW ALMOST 51% FROM 1990

TEXAS ITSELF IS SHOWING
SIGNS OF RAPID GROWTH--

PLANNING YOUR FUTURE BY OWNING
TEXAS REAL ESTATE.
>> THIS AREA'S GROWING
VERY RAPIDLY.
THE COST OF LIVING HERE
IS VERY, VERY LOW.
YOU CAN COMPARE IT TO ANY OTHER
PART OF THE COUNTRY, I THINK.
IT'S HARD TO MAKE A MISTAKE
BUYING PROPERTY IN THIS PART
OF THE WORLD.
>> LAKE CONROE IS PRETTY WELL
SATURATED, AND HOUSTON JUST
KEEPS MOVING FORWARD, KEEPS
MOVING FORWARD.
AND ON LAKE LIVINGSTON,
WATERWOOD IS THE PREMIER PLACE
ON LAKE LIVINGSTON.
>> WE FELL IN LOVE WITH
THE PROPERTY, AND WE BOUGHT IT
AND BUILT OUR HOUSE ON IT, AND
WE LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT WE
BOUGHT THE PROPERTY NEXT TO US
AS WELL.
>> THERE IS SOMETHING FOR
EVERYONE HERE, AND THE BEST

NEVER WILL BE REACHED;
THE FREE STAR TRADER WORKSHOP
CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY TO MAKE
EXTRAORDINARY WEALTH.
> KYLE I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BOUGHT
AND SOLD STOCKS ON YOUR
OWN FOR MANY YEARS NOW.
WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY
PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED
TO THE STAR TRADER SYSTEM?
> WELL SUSAN THE BUSINESS WORLD
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
A FEW YEARS AGO.
COMPANIES DOWNSIZED; MANY VERY
SMART PEOPLE WERE WITHOUT A JOB
AND THOSE WHO KEPT THEIR JOBS
HAVE BEEN WORKING HARDER AND
LONGER HOURS AND YET THE STOCK
MARKET CONTINUED TO MAKE MONEY
FOR THOSE WHO HAD CERTAIN
METHODS AND TECHNIQUES TO GUIDE
THEIR INVESTMENTS.
THESE ARE THE SAME PROVEN
FORMULAS THE STAR TRADER SYSTEM
USES TO AVOID LOSSES AND CREATE
GREAT GAINS.
[MUSIC]
> ADHERING TO WHAT YOU'RE
TAUGHT TAKES MOST OF THE RISK
OUT OF THE GAME.
> YOU HAVE TO BE DISCIPLINED,
YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK,
BUT THE REWARDS ARE PHENOMENAL
AND THE RISKS ARE MINIMAL.
> HERE'S SOME OF MY PROFITS FOR
SOME OF THE DAYS FOR THE LAST
MONTH, $2300, $4600, $3200,
$3000, $3300 AND OVERALL
FOR THE LAST MONTH OR SO
I'M UP ABOUT $870.
> OF COURSE THE MOST IMPORTANT
INFORMATION YOU'LL GET AT THE
WORKSHOP IS HOW TO KNOW WHAT
STOCKS TO BUY AND WHEN IT IS THE
BEST TIME TO BUY OR SELL SHARES.
> RANCE MASHECK CREATED THE STAR
TRADER SYSTEM BASED ON THE SAME
TECHNIQUES HE TAUGHT TO OVER
100,000 PEOPLE INCLUDING MAJOR
GROUPS OF PROFESSIONAL FLOOR
TRADERS, FUND MANAGERS AND STOCK
BROKERS TO HELP THEM EARN
MILLIONS IN PROFITS.
NOW THAT VERY SAME INFORMATION
IS AVAILABLE TO YOU AT THE FREE
STAR TRADER WORKSHOP
COMING UP THIS WEEK.
> OKAY, HERE'S A QUICK RECAP OF
THE STAR TRADER SYSTEM; THERE
ARE FIVE KEYS TO THE FORMULA AND
FIVE POINTS TO A STAR.
EACH POINT IS ASSIGNED A SUBJECT
PERTAINING TO THE STOCK WE ARE
INTERESTED IN.
POINT ONE IS FUNDAMENTALS.
NUMBER TWO IS
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS.
NUMBER THREE IS NEWS.
POINT FOUR IS SENTIMENT AND THAT
TECHNIQUE ALONE HAS MADE
THOUSANDS OF INVESTORS FANTASTIC
WEALTH, AND THE FINAL POINT
IS ECONOMY WATCH.
NOW REMEMBER WE'RE GOING TO
GRADE EACH POINT SUBJECT
ON THE STAR.
IF WE AVERAGE OUT TO THE PLUS
SIDE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE MONEY
WHEN THE STOCK GOES UP.
IF IT SHOWS NEGATIVE WE ARE
GOING TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THE
STOCK GOES DOWN.
AND IF IT'S LEVEL,
WE WILL EVEN MAKE
MONEY WHEN THE
STOCK GOES SIDEWAYS.
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE AND YOU CAN
USE IT OVER AND OVER TO
CONSISTENTLY WIN IN THE MARKET.
> WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
TO BE ABLE
TO USE THE SAME KNOWLEDGE THAT
SUCCESSFUL PROFESSIONAL TRADERS
USE ON THE FLOORS OF STOCK
EXCHANGES AND IN THEIR
INVESTMENTS FIRMS?
I MEAN, JUST IMAGE WHAT YOUR
LIFE WOULD BE LIKE TRADING
STOCKS AT HOME EITHER PART TIME
OR FULL TIME AND HAVING THE REST
OF THE TIME AND MONEY TO LIVE
THE GREAT LIFE.
BUT UNTIL NOW YOU HAVE
ONLY IMAGINED.

YOUR AB AND CORE MUSCLES WITH
A GREATER RANGE OF ROTATIONAL
MOTION ON EVERY REP.

TAKE A SHORT SPIN ON RED AND
TONE SEXY, SLENDER WASHBOARD
ABS IN MINUTES.

STOMACH WITHOUT EVER HAVING
TO DO ANOTHER CRUNCH OR

WE WANTED TO INTRODUCE RED TO
THE TOUGHEST GROUP WE COULD
THINK OF... A GROUP OF
FIREFIGHTERS.
THESE GUYS KNOW ALL ABOUT USING
EQUIPMENT TO GET A JOB DONE.
AT FIRST, THEY WERE SKEPTICAL...
>> THERE IS NOTHING MORE BORING
IN THE WORLD THAN WORKING OUT.
>> REAL TEST IS TO GET IT
PAST US.
WE TEND TO BE HARD ON STUFF.
>> Announcer: ...UNTIL THEY
TRIED IT.
>> FEELS GOOD.
>> IT'S PRETTY SOLID.
>> IT'S REALLY SMOOTH.
IT MOVES VERY EASILY.
IT'S PRETTY COOL. [CHUCKLES]
>> I WEIGH 250 POUNDS.
THIS IS SUPPORTING ME JUST FINE.
>> ONCE YOU GET GOING, YOU CAN
START FEELING IT.
ON THE SIDES, DEFINITELY.
>> HOO, THERE IT IS!
>> YEAH, YOU CAN FEEL IT
BURNING RIGHT HERE.
>> WELL, I'M FEELING IT IN
MY LOWER ABS, AND I'M ALSO
FEELING IT IN MY OBLIQUES.
[GEAR CRANKS]
>> THE CORE AND ALL THE WAY IN
TO THE BACK, YOU CAN FEEL IT.
THE MORE YOU DO IT, YOU START
FEELING THE BURN.
IT FEELS GOOD.
>> SEE, I CAN, I CAN FEEL IT
HERE BUT I CAN ALSO FEEL IT
A LITTLE MORE IN MY HIPS, TOO.
IT'LL BE A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> YOU CAN GET A GOOD WORKOUT
OUT OF THIS.
>> IT'S A NICE,
LOW-IMPACT WORKOUT.
I CAN BORROW IT FOR ABOUT SIX
WEEKS, SEE HOW... [LAUGHTER]
>> IT IS QUICK, YOU KNOW,
AND IT DOES DO ALL THE THINGS
THAT THEY'RE SAYING.
>> Man: SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ON
TO SOMETHING, MAN.
[...]
>> TOP FITNESS TRAINERS HAVE
KNOWN ABOUT THE CORE SCULPTING
POWER OF ROTATIONAL EXERCISES
FOR YEARS, BUT IT'S BEEN HARD
TO DO UNTIL NOW.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO FITNESS
PROFESSIONALS THINK OF RED?
WE TOOK IT TO SOME OF AMERICA'S
FINEST TRAINERS AND EXERCISE
PHYSIOLOGISTS AND ASKED
FOR THEIR OPINIONS.
>> I LOVE RED.
IT'S DONE A LOT FOR MY BACK AND
NECK, AND IT'S HELPED MY CORE
STRENGTH TREMENDOUSLY.
THE RESULTS I'VE SEEN... UH,
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED
RED HAVE BEEN TRULY AMAZING.
IT'S THE BEST ABDOMINAL
EXERCISER I HAVE EVER USED.
>> SO WITH RED, YOU'RE GETTING
ALL AREAS OF THE ABS.
YOU'RE GETTING THE OBLIQUES,
YOU'RE GETTING THE UPPER AB, YOU
GET THE LOWER AB, YOU'RE GETTING
THE WHOLE CENTRAL ABDOMINAL
MUSCLES, NOT JUST STRICTLY
ISOLATING ONE SMALL SECTION LIKE
THE OLD-FASHIONED AB CRUNCHERS
WHERE YOU'RE JUST COMING
STRAIGHT FORWARD AND BACK DOWN.
SO YOU BASICALLY GET A FULL
ABDOMINAL WORKOUT, HITTING
ALL AREAS OF YOUR AB MUSCLES
WITH RED.
>> WELL, WE'RE RAISING OUR HEART
RATE, WE'RE HELPING TO CIRCULATE
AND STIMULATE THE BLOOD FLOW.
I THINK RED WOULD WORK FOR
JUST ABOUT ANYONE.
>> RED IS GREAT FOR THE LOWER
ABS, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN.
UM, A LOT OF CLIENTS THAT
I HAVE WHO'VE HAD BABIES,
THIS IS GREAT.
IT REALLY GETS DEEP IN THERE,
WORKS THE CORE MUSCLES OF
THE LOWER PART OF THE ABS.
RED IS EASY.
YOU'LL GET YOUR RESULTS.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL IT IN
MY ABDOMINALS, AND I CAN ALSO
FEEL IT IN MY ARMS.
I WORK OUT ALL THE TIME AND
I CAN FEEL THIS MORE
THAN ANYTHING.
DOES IT WORK? ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE KEYS TO RAPID RESULTS ARE
A FULL RANGE OF MOTION AND USING
RESISTANCE TRAINING.
RED INVOLVES ALL OF YOUR CORE
ABDOMINAL MUSCLES TO GET THAT
RICH RANGE OF MOTION THAT
DELIVERS RESULTS.
AS YOU ROTATE ON RED,
YOUR ABS AND CORE MUSCLES
ARE BEING ACTIVATED--
FROM THE HIPS AND BACK TO
OBLIQUES TO CENTER ABS TO
OBLIQUES AND THEN YOUR BACK.
THAT'S 360 DEGREES OF CORE
ABDOMINAL TONING THAT'S
WHITTLING DOWN YOUR WAISTLINE.
>> Gary: AND WHEN RESISTANCE IS
ADDED TO THE FORMULA, THE
RESULTS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
>> BEFORE I STARTED RED, I WAS
FLABBY AND NASTY. [LAUGHS]
I WOULD WEAR BULKY CLOTHES.
AFTER USING RED AND LOSING
THE INCHES AND THE WEIGHT, I
WEAR CLOTHES THAT, YOU KNOW, FIT
ME, THAT SHOW OFF MY BODY AND IT
GOT MY WAIST DOWN SIX INCHES.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> MY STOMACH WAS HUGE.
IT WAS HUGE.
IT WAS, UH, JUST KIND
OF DISGUSTING.
WHEN I USE RED FITNESS, I,
I CAN JUST FEEL IT RIGHT...
I CAN FEEL IT AND I KNOW
IT'S WORKING.
THESE RESULTS FROM USING RED
FITNESS WERE GREAT.
>> WHY HAVEN'T EXERCISE MACHINES
KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES IN TERMS
OF COMFORT?
OUR CAR SEATS, OUR HOME AND
OFFICE FURNITURE-- EVERYTHING
TODAY IS BUILT TO BE COMFORTABLE
EXCEPT FITNESS MACHINES.
>> LET'S FACE IT: A LOT OF
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT ISN'T EASY
FOR BIGGER PEOPLE TO USE.
BUT RED'S PADDED MEMORY FOAM
SEAT CUSHION IS EXTRA WIDE AND
IT'S SOFT AND COMFY.
WHEN THE EXERCISE IS EASY
ON YOUR BODY, YOU CAN
CONCENTRATE ON WORKING OUT
WITHOUT DISTRACTION AND
WITHOUT DISCOMFORT.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO REGULAR
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT RED?
WELL, WE TOOK IT TO 
LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA
TO FIND OUT.
>> THIS IS CUSHIONY, DOES NOT
HURT YOUR BUTT LIKE SITTING ON
A WOOD FLOOR.
>> YOU GOT A LOT OF "CUSH"...
A CUSH FOR THE TUSH. [LAUGHS]
>> YOU COULD SIT HERE AND WATCH
TV WHILE YOU DO IT. [LAUGHS]
>> WOW, THIS FEELS GREAT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S WORKING ALL OF
THE RIGHT MUSCLES.
>> I'M FEELING IT HERE...
AND DOWN LOWER, TOO.
>> I'M STARTING TO FEEL
THE BURN.
>> I'M FEELING THIS BURN HERE
PRETTY FAST DOING THIS.
>> Man: YEAH, IT'S WORKING,
I CAN FEEL IT.
>> YOU CAN FEEL 'EM FLEXING AND
TIGHTENING RIGHT HERE IN
THE FRONT AND THEN ON THE SIDES.
>> I FEEL IN MY LOWER STOMACH.
>> I FEEL IT IN MY STOMACH.
>> MY STOMACH, RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE. >> HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT AROUND,
RIGHT AROUND HERE.
ON THE SIDES DOWN HERE.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL HOW IT
ISOLATES THE MUSCLES.
>> THAT LOWER, VERY LOWER AB.
>> I REALLY LIKE IT.
IT'S GOOD.
>> IT'S VERY GOOD.
>> IT'S EASY TO DO,
IT'S COMFORTABLE.
I LIKE IT, IT JUST FEELS GOOD.
>> YOU FEEL IT ALL THE WAY
AROUND YOUR WAIST, YOU FEEL IT
DOWN THE FRONT.
'CAUSE YOU CAN TELL
I'M BREATHING. [LAUGHS]
IT'S A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOING
TO GET MY SIX PACK BACK.
>> RED'S EASY ON YOUR BODY AND
IT'S ALSO EASY TO USE.
YOUR BACK REMAINS STRAIGHT AND
RELAXED BECAUSE THE VERTEBRAE IN
YOUR BACK ARE IN THE IDEAL,
RELAXED NEUTRAL POSITION.
YOU GRAB HOLD OF THE HANDLES
WHICH ADJUST TO MATCH YOUR ARM
LENGTH, AND NOW YOU JUST ROTATE
RIGHT AND LEFT AND RIGHT
AND LEFT.
AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN YOUR
ROTATION, DIFFERENT ABS AND CORE
MUSCLES ARE RECRUITED,
SO BY DOING ONE FULL REP,
YOU TONE AND STRENGTHEN ALL YOUR
CORE MUSCLES.
YOU'VE TONED YOUR WAISTLINE
ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR THAT
360-DEGREE TONING.
THE KEY IS YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BEND YOUR BACK OVER TO WORK
THE ABS.
YOU SIMPLY TWIST YOUR TORSO
TO ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER.
COMPARE THIS TO THE CRUNCHES ON
ONE OF THOSE EXERCISE BALLS.
THOSE ARE SO HARD TO USE AND
TO BALANCE ON.
EVEN SMALL, SHORT TWISTS LIKE
THIS ARE FIRING OFF AB MUSCLES
ACROSS THE CORE AND HERE IN
THE CENTER OF THE ABS AND ACROSS
THE ABDOMEN.
>> Gary: MAKE RED YOUR FAVORITE
COLOR, LIKE THESE WOMEN WHO TAKE
BODY SLIMMING VERY SERIOUSLY.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING...]
>> MANY OF THE MOVEMENTS
IN DANCE DO DEAL WITH
CIRCULAR MOVEMENT.
OUR DANCERS HAVE TO HAVE
THE SAME MOVEMENT THAT RED HAS
SO THAT THE BODY CAN MOVE
FORWARD, SIDE, BACK AND SIDE.
IT ELONGATES ALL THE MUSCLES
AROUND THE WAISTLINE AND IN
THE UPPER BACK AND THE,
AND THE SHOULDERS.
>> I DANCE AND WORK OUT FOUR TO
FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
RED IS A VERY EFFECTIVE MACHINE.
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY ABDOMINALS,
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY CORE AND
THE RESISTANCE THAT IT TAKES IS
ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT ON MY SPINE
OR MY NECK.
I THINK THE RESULTS YOU WOULD
GET WITH THIS MACHINE WOULD
CERTAINLY BE BENEFICIAL TO
A DANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE
STRETCHING AND HAVING RESISTANCE
AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE
BUILDING STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.
WITH RED, THIS IS VERY
COMFORTABLE TO DO.
I CAN PUT THIS IN MY DEN WHILE
MY KIDS ARE PLAYING AND
WATCH SHOWS WITH THEM AND
DO THIS WORKOUT.
RED IS DECEIVING 'CAUSE IF YOU
JUST LOOK AT IT, IT LOOKS LIKE
A STOOL.
I... WHEN I SAW IT, I SAID,
"WELL, WHERE IS THE MACHINE?"
AND THEY SAID,
"IT'S RIGHT THERE."
AND I SAID, "WHERE?"
AND THEY SAID, "RIGHT THERE,
THAT RED... THE RED IS
THE MACHINE."
AND I SAID, "WELL, HOW DOES
IT WORK?"
IT AND YOU GO SIDE TO SIDE,"
AND IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND IT IS
NOT DIFFICULT, ALTHOUGH
IT'S EFFECTIVE.
I CAN TOTALLY FEEL IT.
I DO LIKE RED.
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT RED,
I THINK IT'S A GREAT MACHINE.
I THINK THAT IT'S SO SMALL AND
IT'S EASY TO FIT IN YOUR HOME.
IT WON'T TAKE UP ROOM.
I THINK... MOSTLY, I THINK
THE RESULTS THAT I'M GOING
TO SEE ARE GONNA BE FANTASTIC.
>> MOST PEOPLE STOP USING
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY
FIND WORKING OUT UNCOMFORTABLE.
THEY GET DISCOURAGED AND QUIT.
BUT WITH RED, WE GUARANTEE
THAT IT'S THE MOST COMFORTABLE
WORKOUT THAT YOU MAY
EVER EXPERIENCE.
THERE'S NO IMPACT ON THE JOINTS,
AND BEST OF ALL, RED'S SMOOTH
MOVEMENT WORKS OUT YOUR CORE
ABDOMINALS THOROUGHLY.
YOU COULD BE BURNING HUNDREDS OF
CALORIES AND SLIMMING DOWN YOUR
MIDSECTION WHILE WATCHING YOUR
FAVORITE TV SHOW, AND YOU WON'T
HAVE TO CRANK UP THE SOUND
BECAUSE RED IS VIRTUALLY SILENT,
NOT LIKE THOSE NOISY TREADMILLS
AND CARDIO BIKES.
RED IS THE COMFORTABLE WAY
TO SLIM DOWN, AND TALKING ABOUT
SLIM, RED DOES NOT TAKE UP
AN ENTIRE ROOM LIKE OTHER BULKY
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT.
USE IT IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR
BEDROOM OR IN THE DEN, AND WHEN
YOU'RE DONE, RED STORES UNDER
YOUR BED IN SECONDS.
RED IS THAT ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
EXERCISE MACHINE THAT'S
COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO USE.
IT'S A SERIOUS WORKOUT THAT'S
EASY ON YOUR BODY.
RED GETS RESULTS.
>> I LOST SEVEN AND A HALF
INCHES OFF MY WAIST IN
EIGHT WEEKS.
THAT'S ALMOST AN INCH A WEEK.
THESE ARE MY OLD PANTS.
AND... THEY'RE HUGE!
I USED TO... I FIT IN THESE
EIGHT WEEKS AGO.
THIS MEANS MORE THAN A SCALE
WILL EVER MEAN, WHEN YOU CAN
GRAB YOUR PANTS... AND DO THAT,
AND KNOW THAT... THEY'RE HUGE.
YOU CAN'T WEAR THEM ANYMORE.
THESE ARE PRETTY
DRAMATIC RESULTS.
THE BEST PART OF THIS IS
WHEN PEOPLE NOTICE.
THEY SAY, "YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT!"
AND THAT'S SO EXCITING
TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY.
>> I LOST FIVE AND A HALF INCHES
OFF MY HIPS, NINE INCHES OFF
MY WAIST, ALL THAT USING RED.
AND ALL THAT WITHIN TWO MONTHS.
NINE INCHES AROUND MY WAIST IS
A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ME
BECAUSE BEFORE, IT JUST,
LIKE, STAYED THERE...
I'LL LOSE THE WEIGHT,
BIGGER ON THE WAIST.
BUT NOW WITH RED, THAT'S GONE.
THESE PANTS USED TO FIT
FAIRLY WELL.
THEY WERE NICE AND COMFORTABLE.
IT LOOKS LIKE A CLOWN OUTFIT.
NOW, I CAN'T EVEN WEAR
THESE ANYMORE.
I MEAN, IT'S HUGE... I MEAN,
TO THE POINT WHERE IF I DON'T
WEAR A BELT, THEY PRETTY MUCH,
LIKE, FALL DOWN TO MY ANKLE.
AND ALL THIS BECAUSE OF RED.
I'M ECSTATIC ABOUT IT, ACTUALLY.
>> WRITE DOWN THIS PHONE NUMBER
AND CALL RIGHT NOW AND PUT AN
EXCITING NEW SPIN ON YOUR ABS
WORKOUT WITH RED.
IT'S HOT, IT WORKS.

there are others who need

Some people have eyes to see
a friend in need of help... 
Let's work on your reading,

Some people have ears to hear

Good job, Max! Thanks.

>> PRESIDENT PAT RILEY RESHAPED 
THE TEAM, ADDING SIX NEW 
PLAYERS.
AFTER BEING BASHED FOR THAT AND 
TAKING OVER THE HEAD COACH 
HEAT, RILEY HAS VINDICATION AS 
HE LEADS MIAMI TO ITS FIRST NBA 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> AND WITH THAT WE WELCOME YOU 
INSIDE THE ESPNEWS ROOM.
WITH ANTHONY AMEY, I'M MICHELLE 
BONNER. 
PAT RILEY SAID HE PACKED ONE 
SUIT, ONE SHIRT AND ONE TIE.
HE WAS NOT THINKING OR PACKING 
FAR GAME SEVEN AND HE DIDN'T 
NEED TO.
>> 18 YEARS AGO WEDNESDAY, 
RILEY WON THE LAST OF HIS FOUR 
NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS AS A HEAD 
COACH.
NOW HE WILL COMMEMORATE THE 
TITLE AS WELL AS CELEBRATING 
THE HEAT'S FIRST IN FRANCHISE 
HISTORY.
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD BE BACK IN DALLAS?
MARK CUBAN FINED FOR WHAT THE 
COMMISSIONER TERMED SEVERAL 
AGENTS OF MISCONDUCT. 
DWYANE WADE AND COMPANY READY 
TO GO, BUT NOT EARLY. 
DIRK NOWITZKI, TWO OF HIS 11 
FIRST-QUARTER POINTS. 
DALLAS LED BY AS MANY AS 14 IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER.
WADE, GOING TO WORK.
HE WENT SCORELESS THE FIRST 10 
MINUTES OF THE GAME.
WENT OFF AFTERWARDS.
30-23, MAVS AFTER ONE.
SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP 
ONE.
JASON WILLIAMS, ONE OF HIS 
SEVEN DIPES BEHIND HIS BACK TO 
ZO MOURNING.
>> THAT WAS PART OF A 13-0 RUN. 
TIED AT 53-53.
MOURNING STUFFS TERRY.
HEAT UP NINE. 
MAVERICKS OUT ON THE BREAK. 
MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE. 
SAGANA DIOP.
THOSE ARE DIOP'S ONLY TWO 
POINTS OF THE GAME. 
HE WOULD MISTHE FREE THROW. 
THE MAVS ARE DOWN THREE.
DOWN FIVE, TERRY, GOING TO PUT 
IT UP.
MOURNING WITH FIVE BLOCKS IN 
THE GAME. 
MAVS DOWN FOUR. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE BACK AFTER 
BEING SUSPENDED FOR GAME FIVE.
OFF GLASS.
DALLAS WITHIN TWO.
THREE-POINT GAME NOW. 
WADE, WITH THREE DEFENDERS 
AROUND HIM. 
JAMES POSEY FOR THREE.
HEAT UP SIX.
IT'S A FOUR-POINT GAME NOW. 
AND STACKHOUSE, FROM THE CORNER 
POCKET, HE FINISHED WITH 12.
AND THE MAVS ARE DOWN ONE.
UNDER 36 TO GO. 
THREE-POINT GAME. 
DIRK NOWITZKI HAS TWO IN THE 
FOURTH. 
BEATS ERICK DAMPIER.
HE LOSES IT.
WADE PICKS IT UP. 
HEAT UP THREE.
10.6 LEFT.
WADE AT THE LINE WITH A CHANCE 
TO ICE IT.
MISSES THE FIRST. 
THEN MISSES THE SECOND. 
THE HEAT WOULD COME UP WITH THE 
REBOUND, BUT TRAVELING IS 
CALLED. 
SO MAVS WITH ONE LAST CHANCE. 
JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE 
TITLE.
THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.

COACHES WHO HAVE WON NBA TITLES 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.

I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAMEERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS -- DALLAS.
MEN OF THE SQUARE TABLE,
WHEN TOASTING,
DO WE CLINK TOPS
OR BOTTOMS?
LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK.
HMMM.
IF THE TOPS TOUCH,

DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE

DO THAT.

THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.

AND TRANSPLANT. 
>> THE KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS 
KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS 
IT WORSE. 
THINK ABOUT THAT.

YOU KNOW? 
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS -- DALLAS.
>> GARY PAYTON WILL TURN 38 
YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH. 
DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.

>> PRESIDENT PAT RILEY RESHAPED 
THE TEAM, ADDING SIX NEW 
PLAYERS.
AFTER BEING BASHED FOR THAT AND 
TAKING OVER THE HEAD COACH 
HEAT, RILEY HAS VINDICATION AS 
HE LEADS MIAMI TO ITS FIRST NBA 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> AND WITH THAT WE WELCOME YOU 
INSIDE THE ESPNEWS ROOM.
WITH ANTHONY AMEY, I'M MICHELLE 
BONNER. 
PAT RILEY SAID HE PACKED ONE 
SUIT, ONE SHIRT AND ONE TIE.
HE WAS NOT THINKING OR PACKING 
FAR GAME SEVEN AND HE DIDN'T 
NEED TO.
>> 18 YEARS AGO WEDNESDAY, 
RILEY WON THE LAST OF HIS FOUR 
NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS AS A HEAD 
COACH.
NOW HE WILL COMMEMORATE THE 
TITLE AS WELL AS CELEBRATING 
THE HEAT'S FIRST IN FRANCHISE 
HISTORY.
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD BE BACK IN DALLAS?
MARK CUBAN FINED FOR WHAT THE 
COMMISSIONER TERMED SEVERAL 
AGENTS OF MISCONDUCT. 
DWYANE WADE AND COMPANY READY 
TO GO, BUT NOT EARLY. 
DIRK NOWITZKI, TWO OF HIS 11 
FIRST-QUARTER POINTS. 
DALLAS LED BY AS MANY AS 14 IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER.
WADE, GOING TO WORK.
HE WENT SCORELESS THE FIRST 10 
MINUTES OF THE GAME.
WENT OFF AFTERWARDS.
30-23, MAVS AFTER ONE.
SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP 
ONE.
JASON WILLIAMS, ONE OF HIS 
SEVEN DIPES BEHIND HIS BACK TO 
ZO MOURNING.
>> THAT WAS PART OF A 13-0 RUN. 
TIED AT 53-53.
MOURNING STUFFS TERRY.
HEAT UP NINE. 
MAVERICKS OUT ON THE BREAK. 
MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE. 
SAGANA DIOP.
THOSE ARE DIOP'S ONLY TWO 
POINTS OF THE GAME. 
HE WOULD MISTHE FREE THROW. 
THE MAVS ARE DOWN THREE.
DOWN FIVE, TERRY, GOING TO PUT 
IT UP.
MOURNING WITH FIVE BLOCKS IN 
THE GAME. 
MAVS DOWN FOUR. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE BACK AFTER 
BEING SUSPENDED FOR GAME FIVE.
OFF GLASS.
DALLAS WITHIN TWO.
THREE-POINT GAME NOW. 
WADE, WITH THREE DEFENDERS 
AROUND HIM. 
JAMES POSEY FOR THREE.
HEAT UP SIX.
IT'S A FOUR-POINT GAME NOW. 
AND STACKHOUSE, FROM THE CORNER 
POCKET, HE FINISHED WITH 12.
AND THE MAVS ARE DOWN ONE.
UNDER 36 TO GO. 
THREE-POINT GAME. 
DIRK NOWITZKI HAS TWO IN THE 
FOURTH. 
BEATS ERICK DAMPIER.
HE LOSES IT.
WADE PICKS IT UP. 
HEAT UP THREE.
10.6 LEFT.
WADE AT THE LINE WITH A CHANCE 
TO ICE IT.
MISSES THE FIRST. 
THEN MISSES THE SECOND. 
THE HEAT WOULD COME UP WITH THE 
REBOUND, BUT TRAVELING IS 
CALLED. 
SO MAVS WITH ONE LAST CHANCE. 
JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE 
TITLE.
THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.
HERE'S THE SHORT LIST OF 
COACHES WHO HAVE WON NBA TITLES 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.
>> COMING UP ON ESPNEWS -- AS 
THE WHITE SOX WERE SOCKING IT 
TO THE CARDINALS, OZZIE GUILLEN 
WAS GETTING SOCKED. 
RYAN HOWARD SOCKED ONE OUT. 
AND ANOTHER.

YANKEES.

K YOU KNOW ALL
THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT GETTING
YOUR CHOLESTEROL RIGHT?
YOU MAY BE WRONG.
BECAUSE GETTING
BAD CHOLESTEROL DOWN
MIGHT BE JUST PART
OF THE EQUATION.
YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO GET
YOUR GOOD CHOLESTEROL UP.
EVEN MORE SURPRISING,
THIS CHOLESTEROL MEDICINE
DOES BOTH.
CRESTOR.
CRESTOR, ALONG WITH DIET,
CAN LOWER BAD CHOLESTEROL
BY UP TO 52%.
BUT CRESTOR ALSO RAISES
YOUR GOOD CHOLESTEROL.
DOWN WITH THE BAD.
UP WITH THE GOOD.
IS CRESTOR RIGHT FOR YOU?
THAT'S BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR DOCTOR.
CRESTOR IS NOT FOR EVERYONE,
INCLUDING PEOPLE
WITH LIVER DISEASE,
AND WOMEN WHO ARE NURSING,
PREGNANT
OR MAY BECOME PREGNANT.
SIMPLE BLOOD TESTS ARE NEEDED
TO CHECK FOR LIVER PROBLEMS.
TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT OTHER
MEDICATIONS YOU'RE TAKING,
OR IF YOU EXPERIENCE
MUSCLE PAIN OR WEAKNESS,
AS THEY MAY BE A SIGN
OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS.
DOWN WITH THE BAD.
UP WITH THE GOOD. 
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT CRESTOR.

PRESCRIPTION COVERAGE
AND CAN'T AFFORD
YOUR MEDICATION,

BLOCKED BY MOURNING, DOES IT 
AGAIN!
>> ALONZO MOURNING COMES UP 
WITH EIGHT POINTS, SIX BOARDS 
AND FIVE BLOCKS TO HELP THE 
HEAT WIN A TITLE AND HIMSELF A 
FIRST RING AFTER OVERCOMING A 
LIFE-THREATENING KIDNEY DISEASE 
AND TRANSPLANT. 
>> THE KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS 
KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS 
IT WORSE. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAT, 
YOU KNOW? 
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME.
>> PILLAR OF STRENGTH.
ALONZO MOURNING.
>> MARK MULDER HOPING TO

HE WAS 5-1 CAREER AGAINST THEM.

HE SAYS THE GUYS HE HIT HA V

HITS CHRIS DUNCAN.
HE GETS TOSSED. 
NOW REMEMBER LAST WEEK, GUILLEN 
WENT OFF ON SEAN TRACEY WHO

THINKING TWICE ABOUT SAYING 
ANYTHING MORE.
HEADS BACK TO CLUBHOUSE AFTER 
BEING EJECTED.

HOWARD, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
THIS TIME.
GROUND OUT TO SECOND. 
RIVERA, RECORDING HIS FIRST 
SIX-OUT SAVE OF THE SEASON AS 
THE YANKEES END A THREE-GAME 
SLIDE.
>> TOGETHER, THEY MIGHT FORM 
THE MOST UNSTOPPABLE DUO IN THE 
NBA.
EVEN IF THAT'S NOT TRUE, 
THERE'S NO ARGUING THE RESULTS. 
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL AND DWYANE 
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.

DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.

>> THE LAST TIME PAT RILEY 
COACHED A TEAM TO A 
CHAMPIONSHIP, THE MIAMI HEAT 
DIDN'T EXIST. 
SHAQ WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL, 
D. WADE WAS 6 YEARS OLD.
MEN OF THE SQUARE TABLE,
AS A CULTURE, DO WE WANT
TO BE REMEMBERED FOR THIS?
IT'S HILARIOUS.
PEOPLE LAUGH
BECAUSE IT'S MORONIC.
NOT BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY.
THIS IS MAN LAW,
NOT CAVEMAN LAW.
HEY, HAVE YOU DONE IT? NO!
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
CRUSHING BEER CANS
ON YOUR FOREHEAD IS WRONG.
TRIPLE H IS RIGHT. CANS AIN'T

TO ICE IT.
MISSES THE FIRST. 
THEN MISSES THE SECOND. 
THE HEAT WOULD COME UP WITH THE 
REBOUND, BUT TRAVELING IS 
CALLED. 
SO MAVS WITH ONE LAST CHANCE. 
JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE 
TITLE.
THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.
HERE'S THE SHORT LIST OF 
COACHES WHO HAVE WON NBA TITLES 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.

MIGHT BE JUST PART
OF THE EQUATION.
YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO GET
YOUR GOOD CHOLESTEROL UP.
EVEN MORE SURPRISING,
THIS CHOLESTEROL MEDICINE
DOES BOTH.
CRESTOR.
CRESTOR, ALONG WITH DIET,
CAN LOWER BAD CHOLESTEROL

BUT CRESTOR ALSO RAISES
YOUR GOOD CHOLESTEROL.

IS CRESTOR RIGHT FOR YOU?
THAT'S BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR DOCTOR.
CRESTOR IS NOT FOR EVERYONE,
INCLUDING PEOPLE
WITH LIVER DISEASE,
AND WOMEN WHO ARE NURSING,
PREGNANT
OR MAY BECOME PREGNANT.
SIMPLE BLOOD TESTS ARE NEEDED
TO CHECK FOR LIVER PROBLEMS.
TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT OTHER
MEDICATIONS YOU'RE TAKING,

AS THEY MAY BE A SIGN
OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS.
DOWN WITH THE BAD.
UP WITH THE GOOD.

FIRST RING AFTER OVERCOMING A 
LIFE-THREATENING KIDNEY DISEASE

>> THE KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS 
KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS 
IT WORSE. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAT, 
YOU KNOW? 
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER I BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.

THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS

WHEN TOASTING,
DO WE CLINK TOPS
OR BOTTOMS?
LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK.
HMMM.
IF THE TOPS TOUCH,
THEN OUR SALIVA IS TOUCHING.
WELL, THEN TECHNICALLY
THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS A KISS.

DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.

HE WAS NOT THINKING OR PACKING

WENT OFF AFTERWARDS.

SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP

MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE. 
SAGANA DIOP.

HE WOULD MISTHE FREE THROW. 
THE MAVS ARE DOWN THREE.

THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.

KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS 
IT WORSE.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS -- DALLAS.
>> GARY PAYTON WILL TURN 38 
YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH. 
DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.
>> BACK TO THE DIAMOND, ADRIAN 
BELTRE RETURNING TO LOS ANGELES 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE LED 
THE DODGERS TO THE DIVISION 
TITLE BACK IN 2004. 
TOP ONE A TWO-RUN SHOT, HIS

HE WENT SCORELESS THE FIRST 10 
MINUTES OF THE GAME.
WENT OFF AFTERWARDS.
30-23, MAVS AFTER ONE.
SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP 
ONE.
JASON WILLIAMS, ONE OF HIS

TIED AT 53-53.
MOURNING STUFFS TERRY.
HEAT UP NINE. 
MAVERICKS OUT ON THE BREAK. 
MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE. 
SAGANA DIOP.
THOSE ARE DIOP'S ONLY TWO

HE WOULD MISTHE FREE THROW. 
THE MAVS ARE DOWN THREE.

JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE 
TITLE.
THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.

NOW REMEMBER LAST WEEK, GUILLEN 
WENT OFF ON SEAN TRACEY WHO 
FAILED TO RETALIATE.
THINKING TWICE ABOUT SAYING 
ANYTHING MORE.
HEADS BACK TO CLUBHOUSE AFTER 
BEING EJECTED.
>> TWO ON FOR HOWARD. 
LOOK WHERE THIS GOES. 
ESTIMATED AT 461 FEET.
IT'S THE FIRST TO REACH THE 
THIRD-DECK LEVEL IN THE 
THREE-YEAR HISTORY OF CITIZENS 
BANK PARK.
HOWARD GOES OPPOSITE FIELD. 
A TWO-RUN SHOT. 
HIS SECOND OF THE DAY.
25TH OF THE YEAR. 
BOTTOM FIVE NOW, TWO ON FOR 
HOWARD. 
DOWN THE RIGHT FIELD LEAN.
HE'LL DROP IT INTO THIRD WITH A 
TRIPLE. 
TWO RUNS SCORE. 
HE HAD A CAREER HIGH SEVEN 
R.B.I. AND THE PHILS ARE ON TOP 
7-5.
TOP EIGHT, HERE COME THE YANK, 
DOWN A RUN. 
RUNNERS ON THE CORNERS. 
JOHNNY DAMON , RIGHT OVER AARON 
ROWAND. 
HE'LL DROP INTO THIRD WITH A 
TRIPLE.

RUNS WITH TWO ON. 
HOWARD FACING MARIAN OWE 
RIVERA. 
AND HERE'S THE DRAMA. 
HOWARD, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
THIS TIME.
GROUND OUT TO SECOND. 
RIVERA, RECORDING HIS FIRST 
SIX-OUT SAVE OF THE SEASON AS 
THE YANKEES END A THREE-GAME 
SLIDE.
>> TOGETHER, THEY MIGHT FORM 
THE MOST UNSTOPPABLE DUO IN THE 
NBA.
EVEN IF THAT'S NOT TRUE, 
THERE'S NO ARGUING THE RESULTS. 
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL AND DWYANE 
WA
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS
GO GO GO ! YES !

>> GARY PAYTON WILL TURN 38 
YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH. 
DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.
>> BACK TO THE DIAMOND, ADRIAN

MORRIS ALLOWED JUST ONE RUN.
GIANTS WIN IT 3-2.
THEY'VE WON FIVE STRAIGHT OVER 
THE HALOS.
>> THE LAST TIME PAT RILEY 
COACHED A TEAM TO A 
CHAMPIONSHIP, THE MIAMI HEAT 
DIDN'T EXIST. 
SHAQ WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL, 
D. WADE WAS 6 YEARS OLD.
MEN OF THE SQUARE TABLE,
WHEN TOASTING,
DO WE CLINK TOPS
OR BOTTOMS?
LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK.
HMMM.
IF THE TOPS TOUCH,
THEN OUR SALIVA IS TOUCHING.
WELL, THEN TECHNICALLY
THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS A KISS.
OH, COME ON!
TELL YOU WHAT,
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TOUCH BOTTOMS.
NO, THANKS, HOLLYWOOD.
I AIN'T INTO THAT.

PLAYERS.
AFTER BEING BASHED FOR THAT AND

CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> AND WITH THAT WE WELCOME YOU 
INSIDE THE ESPNEWS ROOM.
WITH ANTHONY AMEY, I'M MICHELLE 
BONNER. 
PAT RILEY SAID HE PACKED ONE 
SUIT, ONE SHIRT AND ONE TIE.
HE WAS NOT THINKING OR PACKING 
FAR GAME SEVEN AND HE DIDN'T 
NEED TO.
>> 18 YEARS AGO WEDNESDAY, 
RILEY WON THE LAST OF HIS FOUR 
NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS AS A HEAD 
COACH.
NOW HE WILL COMMEMORATE THE 
TITLE AS WELL AS CELEBRATING 
THE HEAT'S FIRST IN FRANCHISE 
HISTORY.

MARK CUBAN FINED FOR WHAT THE 
COMMISSIONER TERMED SEVERAL 
AGENTS OF MISCONDUCT. 
DWYANE WADE AND COMPANY READY

HE WENT SCORELESSHE FIRST 10

SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP

JASON WILLIAMS, ONE OF HIS

MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE.

JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE

THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.
HERE'S THE SHORT LIST OF 
COACHES WHO HAVE WON NBA TITLES 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.

FIRST RING AFTER OVERCOMING A 
LIFE-THREATENING KIDNEY DISEASE 
AND TRANSPLANT. 
>> THE KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS 
KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS

PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS

(talk show host)
We're back with the GEICO Gecko.
(talk show host) So now here's
the thing I don't understand,
people could save...
hundreds of dollars on car
insurance by switching to GEICO.
Right.
(talk show host) So, I have to
ask, why does GEICO even need a
talking gecko?
Well, entertainment.
(talk show host)
How's that?
Look, you can't just tell
people that GEICO could
save'em money...
it's true, yes, but it's a bit
boring. So you...
have a little gecko
entertain, play a little
guitar or whatever.
They think they're watching
entertaining television, but
they're actually watching...
[whispering]
a commercial.
(male narrator)
GEICO. Fifteen minutes
could save you...
fifteen percent or
more on car insurance.
>> GARY PAYTON WILL TURN 38 
YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH. 
DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.
>> BACK TO THE DIAMOND, ADRIAN

>> AND WITH THAT WE WELCOME YOU 
INSIDE THE ESPNEWS ROOM.
WITH ANTHONY AMEY, I'M MICHELLE 
BONNER. 
PAT RILEY SAID HE PACKED ONE 
SUIT, ONE SHIRT AND ONE TIE.
HE WAS NOT THINKING OR PACKING 
FAR GAME SEVEN AND HE DIDN'T 
NEED TO.
>> 18 YEARS AGO WEDNESDAY, 
RILEY WON THE LAST OF HIS FOUR 
NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS AS A HEAD 
COACH.
NOW HE WILL COMMEMORATE THE 
TITLE AS WELL AS CELEBRATING 
THE HEAT'S FIRST IN FRANCHISE 
HISTORY.
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD BE BACK IN DALLAS?
MARK CUBAN FINED FOR WHAT THE 
COMMISSIONER TERMED SEVERAL 
AGENTS OF MISCONDUCT. 
DWYANE WADE AND COMPANY READY 
TO GO, BUT NOT EARLY. 
DIRK NOWITZKI, TWO OF HIS 11 
FIRST-QUARTER POINTS. 
DALLAS LED BY AS MANY AS 14 IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER.
WADE, GOING TO WORK.
HE WENT SCORELESS THE FIRST 10 
MINUTES OF THE GAME.
WENT OFF AFTERWARDS.
30-23, MAVS AFTER ONE.
SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP 
ONE.
JASON WILLIAMS, ONE OF HIS 
SEVEN DIPES BEHIND HIS BACK TO 
ZO MOURNING.
>> THAT WAS PART OF A 13-0 RUN. 
TIED AT 53-53.
MOURNING STUFFS TERRY.
HEAT UP NINE. 
MAVERICKS OUT ON THE BREAK. 
MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE. 
SAGANA DIOP.
THOSE ARE DIOP'S ONLY TWO 
POINTS OF THE GAME. 
HE WOULD MISTHE FREE THROW. 
THE MAVS ARE DOWN THREE.
DOWN FIVE, TERRY, GOING TO PUT 
IT UP.
MOURNING WITH FIVE BLOCKS IN 
THE GAME. 
MAVS DOWN FOUR. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE BACK AFTER 
BEING SUSPENDED FOR GAME FIVE.
OFF GLASS.
DALLAS WITHIN TWO.
THREE-POINT GAME NOW. 
WADE, WITH THREE DEFENDERS

JAMES POSEY FOR THREE.

WADE PICKS IT UP. 
HEAT UP THREE.
10.6 LEFT.
WADE AT THE LINE WITH A CHANCE

SO MAVS WITH ONE LAST CHANCE. 
JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE 
TITLE.
THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.

>> THE KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS 
KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS 
IT WORSE. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAT, 
YOU KNOW? 
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT

HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE

THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL.

DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN

WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.

CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.
HERE'S THE SHORT LIST OF 
COACHES WHO HAVE WON NBA TITLES 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.

OR SOMETHING?

ANY POINTS, SO...
THAT MAKES IT HARDER
TO REDEEM THEM. 
( laughs )
IT SURE DOES.
I'M THINKING ABOUT
GETTING A 10-GALLON HAT,
MAYBE SOME NUNCHUCKS.

>> TURNOVER, TERRY GETS THE 
BLOCKED BY MOURNING, DOES IT 
AGAIN!
>> ALONZO MOURNING COMES UP 
WITH EIGHT POINTS, SIX BOARDS 
AND FIVE BLOCKS TO HELP THE 
HEAT WIN A TITLE AND HIMSELF A 
FIRST RING AFTER OVERCOMING A 
LIFE-THREATENING KIDNEY DISEASE 
AND TRANSPLANT. 
>> THE KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS 
KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS 
IT WORSE. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAT, 
YOU KNOW? 
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME.
>> PILLAR OF STRENGTH.
ALONZO MOURNING.

THINKING TWICE ABOUT SAYING 
ANYTHING MORE.
HEADS BACK TO CLUBHOUSE AFTER 
BEING EJECTED.
>> TWO ON FOR HOWARD. 
LOOK WHERE THIS GOES. 
ESTIMATED AT 461 FEET.
IT'S THE FIRST TO REACH THE 
THIRD-DECK LEVEL IN THE 
THREE-YEAR HISTORY OF CITIZENS

HOWARD GOES OPPOSITE FIELD.

EVEN IF THAT'S NOT TRUE, 
THERE'S NO ARGUING THE RESULTS.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS -- DALLAS.
>> GARY PAYTON WILL TURN 38 
YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH. 
DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.

CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.
HERE'S THE SHORT LIST OF 
COACHES WHO HAVE WON NBA TITLES 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.
>> COMING UP ON ESPNEWS -- AS 
THE WHITE SOX WERE SOCKING IT 
TO THE CARDINALS, OZZIE GUILLEN 
WAS GETTING SOCKED. 
RYAN HOWARD SOCKED ONE OUT. 
AND ANOTHER.

FIRST RING AFTER OVERCOMING A 
LIFE-THREATENING KIDNEY DISEASE

KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING

BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS -- DALLAS.
>> GARY PAYTON WILL TURN 38 
YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH. 
DIDN'T SCORE MUCH IN THIS, HIS 
THIRD NBA FINALS. 
BUT EVERY SHOT HE HIT SEEMED TO 
BE A GIGANTIC ONE.
AFTER 16 YEARS, G.P. FINALLY 
GETS HIS JEWELRY, AND HE SPOKE 
WITH LISA SALTERS AFTER THE 
GAME SIX CLINCHER.
>> GARY, 16 SEASONS FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS ONE FEEL LIKE? 
>> FEELS GREAT, FEELS REAL 
GOOD. 
IT CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT 
THIS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
WE JUST PROVED IT TO ANYBODY. 
>> TO COME HERE, TO WIN FOUR 
STRAIGHT, YOU HADN'T WON HERE 
ALL SEASON LONG.
>> WELL, JUST MOTIVATION AND 
DETERMINATION.
WE KNEW WE WERE COMING UP IN 
HERE. 
WE KNEW WE HAD THEM AS THE 
THREE GAMES BEATING THEM IN 
MIAMI.
WE JUST HAD TO COME IN HERE AND 
BREAK THEIR BACK AND BE SCARED. 
>> WHENG YOU WENT DOWN 0-2, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS 
OVER. 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT KIND OF 
BASKETBALL TEAM.
WE'RE A TEAM WE WANT TO ALWAYS 
BE ON OUR BACK. 
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
AGAINST US. 
WE CAME OUT AND WON FOUR 
STRAIGHT. 
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO 
DO THAT.
>> BACK TO THE DIAMOND, ADRIAN 
BELTRE RETURNING TO LOS ANGELES 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE LED 
THE DODGERS TO THE DIVISION 
TITLE BACK IN 2004. 
TOP ONE A TWO-RUN SHOT, HIS

WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WEID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.
HERE'S THE SHORT LIST OF 
COACHES WHO HAVE WON NBA TITLES 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.
>> COMING UP ON ESPNEWS -- AS 
THE WHITE SOX WERE SOCKING IT 
TO THE CARDINALS, OZZIE GUILLEN 
WAS GETTING SOCKED. 
RYAN HOWARD SOCKED ONE OUT. 
AND ANOTHER.

WITH EIGHT POINTS, SIX BOARDS 
AND FIVE BLOCKS TO HELP THE 
HEAT WIN A TITLE AND HIMSELF A 
FIRST RING AFTER OVERCOMING A 
LIFE-THREATENING KIDNEY DISEASE 
AND TRANSPLANT. 
>> THE KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS 
KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE 
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE HAS 
IT WORSE. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAT, 
YOU KNOW? 
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME.
>> PILLAR OF STRENGTH.
ALONZO MOURNING.

CONTINUE HIS SUCCESS AGAINST 
THE WHITE SOX.
HE WAS 5-1 CAREER AGAINST THEM. 
BOTTOM THREE, WHITE SOX LEADING

NEXT BATTER, PABLO OZUNA HIT BY 
PONSON. 
HE SAYS THE GUYS HE HIT HA V
>> AND YOU KNEW THAT WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN.
HITS CHRIS DUNCAN.
HE GETS TOSSED. 
NOW REMEMBER LAST WEEK, GUILLEN 
WENT OFF ON SEAN TRACEY WHO 
FAILED TO RETALIATE.
THINKING TWICE ABOUT SAYING 
ANYTHING MORE.
HEADS BACK TO CLUBHOUSE AFTER 
BEING EJECTED.
>> TWO ON FOR HOWARD. 
LOOK WHERE THIS GOES. 
ESTIMATED AT 461 FEET.
IT'S THE FIRST TO REACH THE 
THIRD-DECK LEVEL IN THE 
THREE-YEAR HISTORY OF CITIZENS 
BANK PARK.
HOWARD GOES OPPOSITE FIELD. 
A TWO-RUN SHOT.

HOWARD, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
THIS TIME.

RIVERA, RECORDING HIS FIRST 
SIX-OUT SAVE OF THE SEASON AS 
THE YANKEES END A THREE-GAME 
SLIDE.

THE MOST UNSTOPPABLE DUO IN THE 
NBA.
EVEN IF THAT'S NOT TRUE, 
THERE'S NO ARGUING THE RESULTS.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS -- DALLAS.
FELLAS, I'M JUST
WAITING FOR AN EMAIL.
- I'LL BE JUST A MINUTE.
- NO PROBLEM.
SO, BY THE WAY,
GREAT JOB TODAY.
UH, I MEAN, IT WASN'T--
IT WASN'T TOO HARD.
( loud quack )
- WAS THAT YOUR
EMAIL NOTIFICATION?
- YEAH.
( both chuckling softly )
I NEVER HAD YOU PEGGED
FOR A "QUACK" GUY.
- YOU DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY?
- IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
OH, IT IS FUNNY,
YEAH.

- ( laughs ) I LIKE DUCKS.

ENGLAND PLAYS ECUADOR IN THE 
SECOND ROUND ON SUNDAY. 
TODAY'S ACTION MEXICO HASN'T 
LOST IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE 
WORLD CUP SINCE 1994. 
GOOD THING SINCE THEY GET INTO 
THE ROUND OF 16 WITH EITHER A 
WIN OR A TIE. 
PORTUGAL CLINCHED A BIRTH, THE 
FIRST TIME THEY'VE MADE IT PAST 
FIRST PLAY SINCE 1996. 
PORTUGAL AND MEXICOMEXICO, THAT'S A

ON TO WIN 2-1. 
THEY TAKE ALL THREE FIRST ROUND 
GAMES IN GROUP D AND EXTEND 
THEIR UNBEATEN RUN ALLOWING SIX

JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE

THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.

SOON AS IT HAPPENED. 
ENGLAND PLAYS ECUADOR IN THE 
SECOND ROUND ON SUNDAY. 
TODAY'S ACTION MEXICO HASN'T

WIN OR A TIE. 
PORTUGAL CLINCHED A BIRTH, THE

WOULD BE BACK IN DALLAS?
MARK CUBAN FINED FOR WHAT THE 
COMMISSIONER TERMED SEVERAL 
AGENTS OF MISCONDUCT. 
DWYANE WADE AND COMPANY READY 
TO GO, BUT NOT EARLY. 
DIRK NOWITZKI, TWO OF HIS 11 
FIRST-QUARTER POINTS. 
DALLAS LED BY AS MANY AS 14 IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER.
WADE, GOING TO WORK.
HE WENT SCORELESS THE FIRST 10 
MINUTES OF THE GAME.
WENT OFF AFTERWARDS.
30-23, MAVS AFTER ONE.
SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP 
ONE.
JASON WILLIAMS, ONE OF HIS 
SEVEN DIPES BEHIND HIS BACK TO 
ZO MOURNING.
>> THAT WAS PART OF A 13-0 RUN. 
TIED AT 53-53.
MOURNING STUFFS TERRY.
HEAT UP NINE. 
MAVERICKS OUT ON THE BREAK. 
MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE. 
SAGANA DIOP.
THOSE ARE DIOP'S ONLY TWO 
POINTS OF THE GAME. 
HE WOULD MISTHE FREE THROW. 
THE MAVS ARE DOWN THREE.
DOWN FIVE, TERRY, GOING TO PUT 
IT UP.
MOURNING WITH FIVE BLOCKS IN 
THE GAME. 
MAVS DOWN FOUR. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE BACK AFTER 
BEING SUSPENDED FOR GAME FIVE.
OFF GLASS.
DALLAS WITHIN TWO.
THREE-POINT GAME NOW. 
WADE, WITH THREE DEFENDERS 
AROUND HIM. 
JAMES POSEY FOR THREE.
HEAT UP SIX.
IT'S A FOUR-POINT GAME NOW. 
AND STACKHOUSE, FROM THE CORNER 
POCKET, HE FINISHED WITH 12.
AND THE MAVS ARE DOWN ONE.
UNDER 36 TO GO. 
THREE-POINT GAME. 
DIRK NOWITZKI HAS TWO IN THE 
FOURTH. 
BEATS ERICK DAMPIER.
HE LOSES IT.
WADE PICKS IT UP. 
HEAT UP THREE.
10.6 LEFT.
WADE AT THE LINE WITH A CHANCE 
TO ICE IT.
MISSES THE FIRST. 
THEN MISSES THE SECOND. 
THE HEAT WOULD COME UP WITH THE 
REBOUND, BUT TRAVELING IS 
CALLED. 
SO MAVS WITH ONE LAST CHANCE. 
JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE 
TITLE.
THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.

HOWARD FACING MARIAN OWE 
RIVERA. 
AND HERE'S THE DRAMA. 
HOWARD, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
THIS TIME.
GROUND OUT TO SECOND. 
RIVERA, RECORDING HIS FIRST 
SIX-OUT SAVE OF THE SEASON AS 
THE YANKEES END A THREE-GAME 
SLIDE.
>> TOGETHER, THEY MIGHT FORM 
THE MOST UNSTOPPABLE DUO IN THE 
NBA.
EVEN IF THAT'S NOT TRUE, 
THERE'S NO ARGUING THE RESULTS.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.

FLIGHT HOME PRODUCE DALLAS. 
. 
THEY FINISHED 22 BOTTLES 
KRYSTAL. 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 
FESTIVITIES WON'T BE INTERRUPTED
BY ANYTHING LIKE REST. 
RILEY SAID THEY'LL SLEEP IN THE 
SUMMERTIME. 
THEY ARRIVED HOME JUST BEFORE 
7:00 A.M. THIS MORNING AND 
WELCOMED BY FANS AT MIAMI 
OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO PLAN 
WHERE AND WHEN WILL THE PARADE 
ONE LOSS IN THE LAST 11 STARTS. 
6-1 OVER THAT STRETCH. 
THE TIGERS HAVE WON SEVEN 
STRAIGHT AGAINST THE NATIONAL 
LEAGUE. 
THE ENGLISH TEAM WILL PLAY 
REMAINDER OF THE WORLD CUP 
WITHOUT MICHAEL OWEN. 
THE STRIKER LEFT THE THE GAME 
WITH A KNEE INJURY, A TORN ACL. 
ENGLAND HAS ONLY THREE STRIKERS 
LEFT. 
OWEN'S RIGHT KNEE BUCKLED AFTER 
HE PLAYED A PASS. 
HE WAS CARRIED OFF OF THE FIELD 
ON A STRETCHER. 
AFTER HE WAS SEEN BY THE DOCTORS
OF THE
HE KNEW HE WAS IN TROUBLE AS 
SOON AS IT HAPPENED. 
ENGLAND PLAYS ECUADOR IN THE 
SECOND ROUND ON SUNDAY. 
TODAY'S ACTION MEXICO HASN'T 
LOST IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE 
WORLD CUP SINCE 1994. 
GOOD THING SINCE THEY GET INTO 
THE ROUND OF 16 WITH EITHER A 
WIN OR A TIE. 
PORTUGAL CLINCHED A BIRTH, THE 
FIRST TIME THEY'VE MADE IT PAST 
FIRST PLAY SINCE 1996. 
PORTUGAL AND MEXICO, THAT'S A 
GOAL, 1-0 PORTUGAL. 
SIXTH MINUTE NO SCORE. 
THAT SETS UP A PENALTY SHOT. 
SIMMIO SCORES ON THE PENALTY 
SHOT. 
MEXICO DOWN 2-1 SECOND HALF. 
HAND BALL CALLED ON MIGUEL. 
P IN THE BOX, ANOTHER PENALTY 
SHOT. 
THIS TIME OMAR BRAVO WITH THE 
ANCE. 
BRAVO'S PEN SHOT SAILING WAY 
OVER THE TOP OF THE GOAL. 
PORTUGAL WINS IT 2-1 TAKING ALL 
OF THE FIRST ROUND GAMES IN 
GROUP D AND EXTENDING THEIR 
UNBEATEN RUN. 
MEXICO WILL PLAY THE GROUP C 
WINNER AND PORTUGAL WILL PLAY 
EITHER THE NETHERLANDS OR 
ARGENTINA. 
ANGOLA COULD POSSIBLY ADVANCE TO
THE NEXT ROUND WITH A BIG WIN 
OVER ALREADY ELIMINATED IRAN. 
60th MINUTE. 
NO SCORE. 
ANGOLA SCORING ITS FIRST EVER 
WORLD CUP TO TAKE THE LEAD. 
75th MINUTE, IRAN TAKES IT DOWN 
1-0. 
ANOTHER HEADER. 
THIS ONE TIES THE GAME AT ONE. 
NOW WE GO TO STOPPAGE TIME. 
ANGOLA WITH THE KICK. 
HUGE CHANCE FOR THE WIN. 
NO WAY. 
THAT'S AN EASY SAVE. 
THIS GAME ENDING 1-1 DRAW. 
IRAN'S CHANCE AT THE WORLD CUP 
IS ALSO OVER. 
TOP STORIES ARE COMING UP ON 
SNENS. 
THE HEAT BROUGHT HOME MIAMI'S 
FIRST EVER CHAMPIONSHIP.

THE HEAT'S FIRST IN FRANCHISE 
HISTORY.
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD BE BACK IN DALLAS?
MARK CUBAN FINED FOR WHAT THE 
COMMISSIONER TERMED SEVERAL 
AGENTS OF MISCONDUCT. 
DWYANE WADE AND COMPANY READY 
TO GO, BUT NOT EARLY. 
DIRK NOWITZKI, TWO OF HIS 11 
FIRST-QUARTER POINTS. 
DALLAS LED BY AS MANY AS 14 IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER.
WADE, GOING TO WORK.
HE WENT SCORELESS THE FIRST 10 
MINUTES OF THE GAME.
WENT OFF AFTERWARDS.
30-23, MAVS AFTER ONE.
SECOND QUARTER, MAVS BY FIVE. 
GIVES IT TO TERRY.
LATER IN THE SECOND, HEAT UP 
ONE.
JASON WILLIAMS, ONE OF HIS 
SEVEN DIPES BEHIND HIS BACK TO 
ZO MOURNING.
>> THAT WAS PART OF A 13-0 RUN. 
TIED AT 53-53.
MOURNING STUFFS TERRY.
HEAT UP NINE. 
MAVERICKS OUT ON THE BREAK. 
MARQUIS DANIELS CAME IN WITH A 
TOTAL OF FIVE POINTS IN THE 
SERIES. 
MAVS DOWN SEVEN.
FOURTH QUARTER, HEAT UP THREE.
WADE TO SHAQ. 
HE FINISHED WITH NINE POINTS. 
HEAT UP FIVE. 
SAGANA DIOP.
THOSE ARE DIOP'S ONLY TWO 
POINTS OF THE GAME. 
HE WOULD MISTHE FREE THROW. 
THE MAVS ARE DOWN THREE.
DOWN FIVE, TERRY, GOING TO PUT 
IT UP.
MOURNING WITH FIVE BLOCKS IN 
THE GAME. 
MAVS DOWN FOUR. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE BACK AFTER 
BEING SUSPENDED FOR GAME FIVE.
OFF GLASS.
DALLAS WITHIN TWO.
THREE-POINT GAME NOW. 
WADE, WITH THREE DEFENDERS 
AROUND HIM. 
JAMES POSEY FOR THREE.
HEAT UP SIX.
IT'S A FOUR-POINT GAME NOW. 
AND STACKHOUSE, FROM THE CORNER 
POCKET, HE FINISHED WITH 12.
AND THE MAVS ARE DOWN ONE.
UNDER 36 TO GO. 
THREE-POINT GAME. 
DIRK NOWITZKI HAS TWO IN THE 
FOURTH. 
BEATS ERICK DAMPIER.
HE LOSES IT.
WADE PICKS IT UP. 
HEAT UP THREE.
10.6 LEFT.
WADE AT THE LINE WITH A CHANCE 
TO ICE IT.
MISSES THE FIRST. 
THEN MISSES THE SECOND. 
THE HEAT WOULD COME UP WITH THE 
REBOUND, BUT TRAVELING IS 
CALLED. 
SO MAVS WITH ONE LAST CHANCE. 
JASON TERRY FOR THREE.
RIMS OUT. 
GIVING THE HEAT THEIR FIRST 
TITLE IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. 
THEY'RE ONLY THE THIRD TEAM IN 
NBA HISTORY TO WALK WITH THE 
TITLE.
THAT'S A CLASS ACT WITH MARK 
CUBAN SHOWING HIS APPRECIATION. 
D. WADE, 36 POINTS, THE M.V.P. 
OF THIS SERIES. 
>> WHAT A FINISH TO AN AMAZING 
NBA PLAYOFFS.
>> I SAID IT, AND I MEAN IT, I 
WOULD GIVE UP SIX FOR THIS ONE. 
I WOULD HAVE. 
I WOULD TRADE THEM ALL IN FOR 
THIS ONE. 
NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO ANY OF 
THEM THAT I WON, BUT AFTER 18 
YEARS, AND CHASING, YOU KNOW, 
COMBROW KEEP CHASING IT, YOU 
KEEP CHASING IT.
YOU GET TIRED.
SO THIS GIVES ME A SENSE OF 
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. 
>> WE CAME UP SHORT.
WE KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE ANY 
AWARDS FOR COMING IN SECOND, 
BUT WE PROVIDED AN AWFUL LOT 
FOR THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS. 
>> OBVIOUSLY DWYANE WAS GREAT 
AFTER GAME TWO OR WHATEVER. 
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE. 
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WON THEM 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU KNOW? 
FROM GAME THREE, WE WERE UP 10. 
HE JUST TOOK OVER SINCE THEN. 
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER LET UP.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PUT 
THIS TEAM ON MY BACK. 
WE DID IT TOGETHER. 
LIKE COACH SAID, IT'S BEEN 15 
STRONG. 
NOW, THEY GAVE ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY BY PUTTING THE BALL 
IN MY HAPPENED. 
AND MY WILL, MAN, TO PROVE 
PEOPLE WRONG, TO NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME, 
WHEN I CAME TO THE SERIES, IT 
WAS I CAN'T SHOOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT 
THAT FROM.
BUT I PROVED TO THEM I CAN 
SHOOT.
AFTER THAT, I PROVED TO THEM I 
CAN PLAY. 
AND THAT'S ALL I TRY TO DO IS 
PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ALL THE 
TIME. 
>> BEING ON A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CALIBER TEAM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE A GREAT 1-2 PUNCH. 
D. WADE IS A FABULOUS PLAYER. 
I FELT WE COULD HAVE GOT IT 
DONE LAST YEAR. 
WE WERE JUST SHORT-HANDED AND 
WE HAD TO SUFFER A LITTLE BIT.
THEN WE REGROUP AND PEOPLE 
DOUBTED US ALL YEAR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE A 
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. 
>> AT JUST 24 YEARS OF AGE, 
DWYANE WADE IN SOME VERY SELECT 
COMPANY.
ONLY RICK BARRY AND ALLEN 
IVERSON AVERAGED MORE POINTS IN 
THEIR FIRST NBA FINALS TRIP 
THAN WADE'S 34.7.
>> YOU STARTED OFF THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE -- OR YOU MENTIONED 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU 
WOULD TRADE ALL FOUR OF YOUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS FOR THE ONE 
YOU JUST CAPTURED.
WHY?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SICK. 
ONE AS A PLAYER AND ONE AS AN 
ASSISTANT COACH.
IT'S A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE 
OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS, SINCE 
WE WON ONE, YOU KNOW WITH A 
GREAT TEAM THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE 
BEEN CHASING THIS WITH THE 
TEAM, TRYING TO GET THE JOB 
DONE. 
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE 
DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?
BUT WITH THIS GROUP OF GUYS, 
WITH SHAQUILLE AND ESPECIALLY 
DUANE AND JO -- ZO AND G.P. 
ANDRIUSKEVICIUSER SON, ALL OF 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN SORT OF 
CUT UP AND SLICE AND WOUNDED. 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
THEY REALLY DON'T.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH 
THESE GUYS WANT TO WIN AND BE 
PART OF THIS. 
AND NOW THEY WILL NEVER, EVER 
NOT BE CALLED ANYTHING ELSE 
OTHER THAN A CHAMPION.
BUT THE MEDIA WILL PROBABLY 
STILL CALL US SOME THINGS.
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO, 
THEY CAN'T EVER TAKE THAT AWAY 
FROM THEM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY 
WANTED IT.
>> CHAMPAGNE-SOAKED PAT RILEY.

KEEPING THIS RIGHT, KEEPING 
YOUR MIND RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
AND I THINK I CREDIT A GREAT 
DEAL OF MY RECOVERY TO THAT, 
BECAUSE I NEVER GAVE UP UP 
HERE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE QUICK TO GIVE UP AND SAY 
WHY ME, WHY ME? 
AND NOT REALIZING THERE'S A 
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE IT A WHOLE LOT WORSE 
THAN YOU DO.
EVERYBODY HAD HAS PROBLEMS. 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS.

>> PAT RILEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TRADED IN THE FIRST SIX RINGS 
HE HAS FOR THE ONE HE GOT ON 
TUESDAY.
THANKS TO SHAQ AND D. WADE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
HE ADDS TO HIS COLLECTION.
>> SHAQ, HOW SWEET DOES THIS 
FEEL? 
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH RING. 
>> IT'S VERY SWEET. 
MY BROTHER RIGHT HERE, I KNEW 
WHEN I SEE HIM PLAY THAT HE WAS 
A SPECIAL PLAYER. 
ONCE I CAME HERE, I KNEW IT WAS 
MY JOB TO TAKE HIM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL.
WE DEVELOPED HIS ALTER EGO 
FLASH.
HE'S VERY UNSELFISH.
I TOLD HIM THEY'RE GOING TO 
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM ME AND 
GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO AND 
TAKE OVER.
>> DWYANE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST 
THING SHAQ SAID TO YOU? 
HE TOLD MIAMI HE WAS HERE TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> HE CALL MED AND SAID I'M 
COMING DOWN THERE TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN THERE TO 
MESS AROUND AND BE OUT ON SOUTH 
BEACH.
I'M COMING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE SAYS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 
TALK, SIT DOWN MAN-TO-MAN AND 
HAVE A TALK.
ONCE WE DID THAT, EVERYTHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN L.A. WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MIAMI. 
HE GOT MY BACK, I GOT HIS BACK 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE ALWAYS 
ROLL. 
>> THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE 
EVER BEEN ON. 
>> WHY? 
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.
WE'VE OWN HAD 0.9 OF AN 
ARGUMENT. 
AND I WASN'T IN EITHER ONE OF 
THEM. 
>> REALLY?
0.9?
>> MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND I 
WASN'T IN ANY OF THEM.
AND THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
THAT'S RARE FOR ME. 
BUT THIS IS A GREAT TEAM. 
WE HINGE OUT TOGETHER, WENT TO 
THE MOVIES TOGETHER.
ANYTIME ANYBODY IS AT A FAMILY 
FUNCTION, EVERYBODY SHOWS UP. 
THE FAMILY SHOWS UP, THE KIDS 
SHOW UP.
PAT RILEY DID A GREAT JOB OF 
PUTTING THIS TEAM TOGETHER.
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION THIS, BUT I'M 
GOING TO BRING IT UP. 
YOU HAVE TO.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KOBE 
BRYANT AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DURING THE 
THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
I THINK THIS ONE MEANS MORE TO 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A SIDE KICK 
HE REALLY LIKES.
>> WHAT I TOOK AWAY, YOU HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND, A TEAM IS REALLY 
A FAMILY. 
THAT'S ONE THING PAT RILEY 
EMPHASIZED. 
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT 
WAS IN THAT PEN.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY, YOU 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE MADE 
AS MANY MISTAKES EARLY ON IN 
THIS RELATIONSHIP BY REALLY NOT 
EMBRACING KOBE BRYANT.
HE REFUSED TO MAKE THE SAME 
MISTAKE ONCE HE CAME TO MIAMI 
AND HAD DWYANE WADE.
BUT GIVE DWYANE WADE CREDIT FOR 
ALSO RECOGNIZING. 
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY HAD THERE.
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW, 
THEY'RE OUR WORLD CHAMPS. 
>> YOU THINK ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE IT IS, SHAQUILLE 
O'NEAL, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMING IN.
ALL THREE FINALS M.V.P. 
HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
DOMINANT PLAYER IN A LONG TIME. 
I THINK THIS IS HIS MOST 
REWARDING CHAMPIONSHIP OF ALL.
HE HAD MORE FUN SCORING NINE 
POINTS IN THE CLOSEOUT GAME 
THAN HE DID IN HIS THREE RINGS 
IN L.A. 
THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HUMILITY THAT DWYANE WADE HAS 
SHOWN TO SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
ALL HE WANT THE WAS RESPECT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL PAVED THE WAY 
FOR THIS GUY. 
GREAT, GREAT FOR THE NBA TO 
HAVE DWYANE WADE ON THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> UNTIL THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
WHEN SPORTS FANS THOUGHT OF 
DUKE, THEY THOUGHT OF BLUE 
DEVILS BASKETBALL.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS 
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI.
THANKS TO THREE NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND 10 FINAL 
FOUR, COACH K IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE 
DUKE CAMPUS.
BUT THE HALL OF FAMER CHOSE NOT 
TO SPEAK OF THE INFAMOUS MARCH 
13 PARTY WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT 
RAPE CHARGES FOR THREE LACROSSE 
PLAYER, UNTIL TUESDAY.
>> I JUST TRY TO ADD SUPPORT 
AND JUST SAY RUN THE COURSE, 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT BE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST SAYING TO MY 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, I'M WITH 
YOU.
MY PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN I DO.
WITH OUR LACROSSE COACH, WHO IS 
A DEAR FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
MIKE PRESSLER DID WRONG.
I LOVE DUKE.
YOU KNOW, DUKE IS A GREAT, 
GREAT SCHOOL. 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> YOU HEARD KRZYZEWSKI MENTION 
MIKE PRESSLER WHO RESIGNED. 
HE SPOKE PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE THE INCIDENT, 
TELLING "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" --
>> WORLD CUP SOCCER.
SWEDEN HAS NEVER LOST A WORLD 
CUP TO ENGLAND. 
TOUGH BREAK FOR ENGLAND'S 
MICHAEL OWEN WHOSE KNEE BUCKLES 
UNDERNEATH HIM. 
HE GOES DOWN HARD.
IT'S TWISTED. 
HE WOULD LEAVE ON THE 
STRETCHER.
THE ENGLAND COACH SAYS IT 
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL. 
HE IS REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
CROUCH HADN'T STARTED BECAUSE 
HE HAD A YELLOW CARD. 
IN THE 34TH MINUTE, THE HIGH 
VOLLEY KICK.
ENGLAND TAKES AN EARLY 1-0 
LEAD. 
BOUNCES IS -- IT OFF HIS CHEST 
AND IN. 
SWEDEN IS DOWN A GOAL.
OFF THE THROW-IN. 
AND NO ONE CAN REALLY DROL THE 
BALL HERE.
PAUL ROBINSON IS BLOCKED. 
AND SWEDEN'S ENRIQUE LARSSON 
GETS IT IN. 
SWEDEN TIES IT UP AT 2-2. 
BOTH TEAMS MOVING ON.
>> NOW THE OFF-SEASON MOVES 
MADE BY MIAMI HAVE PAID OFF IN 
THE FORM OF A TITLE.
WE'RE BACK TO DASMS -- DALLAS.

>> DANYELLE SARGENT JOINS US 
WITH THE TOP STORIES OF THE 
DAY.
>> THE MIAMI HEAT CELEBRATION 
BEGAN ON THE COURT AND 
CONTINUED ON THE FLIGHT HOME 
FROM DALLAS, WHERE COACH, PAT 
RILEY, SAID HIS TEAM DRANK 22 
BOTTLES OF CRYSTAL AFTER 
WINNING THE FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP 
IN FRANCHISE HISTORY, YOU CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE 
FESTIVITIES WON'T BE 
INTERRUPTED BY A LITTLE THING 
LIKE REST.
RILEY SAID WE'LL SLEEP IN THE 
UPPERTIME.
THEY ARRIVED HOME JUST BEFORE 
7:00 A.M. THIS MORNING, THERE'S 
SHAQ CARRYING THAT BIG TROPHY 
THAT HE PROMISED THE FANS.
THEY WERE ALL WELCOMED AT THE 
MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
A PARADE IS TENTATIVELY 
SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON.
THE HEAT AREN'T THE ONLY ONES 
BASKING IN THE GLORY OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
THE CAROLINA HURRICANES 
CELEBRATED AFTER WINNING THE 
STANLEY CUP FINALS WITH A 
PARADE THROUGH DOWNTOWN 
RALEIGH.
THE ENGLISH TEAM WILL PLAY THE 
REMAINDER OF THE WORLD CUP 
WITHOUT MICHAEL OWEN. 
THE STRIKER LEFT TUESDAY'S 
MATCH WITH A KNEE INJURY. 
A SCAN REVEALED A TORN RIGHT 
A.C.L.
WITHOUT OWE WEN ENGLAND HAS 
THREE STRIKERS LEFT, ONE IS A 
17-YEAR-OLD WITH VERY LIMITED 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE. 
OWE WENS' RIGHT KNEE BUCKLES. 
HE WAS TREATED BY DOCTORS AND 
CARRIED OFF THE FIELD ON A 
STRETCHER.
ENGLAND PLAYS ECUADOR IN THE 
SECOND ROUND ON SUNDAY. 
MEXICO HASN'T LOST IN THE FIRST 
ROUND OF THE WORLD CUP SINCE 
1994. 
A GOOD THING SINCE THEY GET 
INTO THE ROUND OF 16 WITH 
EITHER A WIN OR A TIE.
>> SIXTH MINUTE, NO SCORE.
DRAWING THE DEFENSE.
NICE PASS WHO SCORES THERE, 
1-0, PORTUGAL.
LATER, FIRST HALF OFF A 
PORTUGAL CORNER KICK. 
MARQUEZ CALLS FOR THE HAND 
BALL. 
SETS UP A PENALTY SHOT. 
HESITATING ON THE MOVE. 
SCORES ON THE PENALTY KICK. 
IT'S 2-0, PORTUGAL. 
SECOND HALF, MEXICO DOWN 2-0. 
PORTUGAL IN THE BOX, AND GUESS 
WHAT? 
ANOTHER PENALTY SHOT, THIS ONE 
FOR BRA VOFMENT HERE HE IS. 
BRAVO'S PENALTY SHOT SAILING 
OVER THE TOP OF THE GOAL. 
PORTUGAL HOLDS ON.
THEY WIN 2-1, TAKING ALL THREE 
FIRST-ROUND GAMES IN GROUP D 
AND EXTENDING THEIR RUN TO 17 
INTERNATIONAL GAMES.
>> PORTUGAL JUST NEEDED A TIE 
TA WIN THEIR GROUP. 
SO FIVE STARTERS RESTED WITH 
YELLOW CARDS. 
PORTUGAL SCORED TWO GOALS EARLY 
ON AND MEXICO WAS TRYING TO 
CRAWL OUT OF THAT HOLE. 
AND A LITTLE DISCONCERTING FOR 
MEXICO, THEY MISSED A PENALTY 
KICK. 
PEREZ GOES DOWN WITH A SECOND 
YELLOW FOR A RED CARD FOR 
TAKING A DIVE IN THE BOX. 
THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP 
AGAINST THE VERY GOOD SIDE OF 
EITHER ARGENTINA OR THE 
NETHERLANDS.
>> ANGOLA DID NOT SCORE A GOAL 
IN THE TOURNAMENT.
IRAN HAS BEEN ELIMINATED BUT IS 
LOOKING TO AVOID ITS FIRST 
THROY-LOSS APPEARANCE.
>> NO SCORE, ANGOLA ON THE 
CHARGE. 
FLAVIO USING HIS HEAD.
RIGHT THERE ANGOLA SCORING ITS 
FIRST-EVER GOAL.
THEY TAKE A 1-0 LEAD. 
IRAN WITH A CORNER KICK.
DOWN 1-0. 
ANOTHER HEADER. 
IRAN TYING THE GAME UP AT 1-1.
ANGOLA WITH A FREE KICK.
A HUGE CHANCE FOR THE WIN.
TRIES TO SNEAK THIS SHOT. 
THAT'S AN EASY SAVE THERE.
THIS GAME ENDING IN A 1-1 DRAW. 
ANGOLA WILL NOT ADVANCE TO THE 
NEXT RUN. 
IRAN'S RUN AT THE WORLD CUP IS 
ALSO OVER.
AFTERNOON BASEBALL FOR YOU 
TODAY.
TIGERS AND BREWERS. 
DETROIT LEADING 2-1.
CRAIG MONROE HAD AN R.B.I. 
DOUBLE. 
ROBINSON ADDED AN R.B.I. 
SINGLE. 
HE'S ALSO GETTING IT DONE ON 
THE HILL.
>> DANYELLE, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK A 
LITTLE BASKETBALL.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHERE IT WENT 
RIGHT AND WHERE IT WENT WRONG 
IN THE NBA FINALS.
MAVS GO OUT FOUR STRAIGHT.

>> WE RETURN HERE ON "THE 
HOTLIST." 
AGAIN, THE MIAMI HEAT NBA 
CHAMPIONS.
JOINING US RIGHT NOW, DAVID 
MOORE JOINS US AGAIN FROM THE 
"DALLAS MORNING NEWS."
DAVE, BRIAN KENNY HERE FROM 
ESPN. 
HOW ARE YOU?
>> GOOD, HOW ARE YOU. 
>> FIRST, TELL ME.
DOWN 2-0, DOWN 13 IN GAME THREE 
LATE. 
NOW IMPROBABLE NOT TO LOSE 
AGAIN FROM THAT POINT?
>> OH, WHAT MIAMI DID -- AGAIN, 
WE SAW THE BURGEONING STARDOM 
OF DWYANE WADE IN THIS SERIES.
WHAT HE DID IN THOSE LAST FOUR 
GAMES IS GOING TO BE A STANDARD 
FOR A LOT OF PLAYERS. 
AND TO DO THIS IN HIS THIRD 
YEAR AND TO GET THEM TO THIS 
POINT IS REALLY AMAZING AND 
QUITE A TRIBUTE TO HIM. 
>> YOU KNOW, WADE 36 POINTS, 
DAVID, 10 REBOUNDS, FIVE 
ASSISTS, FOUR STEALS, THREE 
BLOCKS, 16-21 FROM THE 
FREE-THROW LINE.
BUT BEYOND JORDAN, WHAT OTHER 
PLAYERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
GAME HAVE HAD THAT TYPE OF NBA 
FINALS OR NBA POSTSEASON RUN AT 
THIS STAGE OF --
>> AT THIS STAGE OF THEIR 
CAREER YOU THROW THAT IN AS 
WELL. 
PAT RILEY WAS ASKED BEFORE THE 
GAME, AS HE'S BEEN ASKED 
HUNDREDS OF TIMES OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS, WHO DO YOU 
COMPARE DWYANE WADE TO, AND 
LAST NIGHT HE SAID HE'S A 
SIGNATURE PLAYER UNTO HIMSELF.
HE REMIND ME A LITTLE BIT OF A 
PANTHER OR A LEOPARD UP IN A 
TREE WHO LETS PREY GO BY AND 
DECIDES WHEN HE'S GOING TO PICK 
HIS SPOT AND POUNCE.
WELL, THIS GUY POUNCED IN HIS 
THIRD YEAR. 
ALL THE LEBRON MANIA IS 
JUSTIFIED, AND LEBRON HAS 
ACHIEVED MORE INDIVIDUALLY AT 
THIS STAGE OF HIS CAREER, BUT 
YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE DWYANE WADE 
IN ON THE ARGUMENT OF WHO THE 
BEST YOUNG PLAYER IN THE GAME 
IS RIGHT NOW. 
>> YOU DO HAVE TO WONDER, I 
KNOW THEY BROUGHT THAT UP ON 
"COLD PIZZA," I WAS LISTENING 
IN. 
WHAT HAPPENS IF LEBRON JAMES IS 
ON THE HEAT?
DO THEY WIN AN NBA 
CHAMPIONSHIP? 
>> I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY 
GOOD CHANCE.
BUT ALSO, DWYANE WADE, THE WAY 
HE CHANGES HIS GAME AND PICKS 
HIS SPOTS, I DON'T THINK YOU 
CAN DIMINISH WHAT HE DOES.
YOU GET BACK TO THE WHOLE THING 
ON CHEMISTRY. 
THIS IS JUST AN IDEAL FIT.
PAT RILEY TOOK A LOT OF HEAT IN 
TEARING UP THAT TEAM AND 
BRINGING IN A LOT OF APPEARED 
TO BE DISPARATE OR ILL-FITTING 
PARTS, SOME VETERANS THAT THERE 
WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT, HOW MUCH 
THEY HAD LEFT, WHETHER THEY 
COULD CO-EXIST. 
IT LOOKED LIKE A CHEMISTRY 
EXPERIMENT DURING THE REGULAR 
SEASON, BUT THEY CAME TOGETHER 
IN THE POSTSEASON.
>> AVERY JOHNSON SAID THE MAVS 
FELL IN LOVE WITH THEIR JUMP 
SHOT. 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 
>> IT WAS VERY UNCHARACTERRIES 
TISK OF THEM. 
THEIR PLAY DETERIORATED AFTER 
THEY BEAT SAN ANTONIO IN THE 
SECOND ROUND. 
THEY USED THEIR SPEED IN THE 
PERIMETER TO PUT DEFENSE IN A 
BAD POSITION. 
THEY TRIED TO SLOW IT DOWN 
AGAINST PHOENIX BECAUSE THEY 
COULDN'T RUN WITH THEM. 
THEN WHEN THEY TRIED TO RUN 
WITH MIAMI THEY COULDN'T GET IT 
BACK. 
THEY ATTACKED AND GOT OUT EARLY 
IN THE GAME, RAN OFF TO A 
14-POINT LEAD AND REALLY HURT 
THE HEAT ON THE PERIMETER WITH 
THEIR SPEED AND THEN JUST GOT 
AWAY FROM IT. 
AND TO ME THE MOST TELLING 
THING WAS SEVEN MINUTES LEFT IN 
THE GAME. 
DALLAS WAS ALREADY IN THE FOUL 
SITUATION.
EVERY TIME THEY'RE FOULED, 
THEY'RE GOING TO THE LINE.
WHAT DO THEY DO?
THE NEXT TWO SHOTS THEY CAME IN 
AND JACKED UP THREE-POINTERS. 
>> WHAT IS IT, DAVID, IN THE 
DYNAMIC OF THE FINALS, WE'VE 
HAD THIS KIND OF TWO YEARS IN A 
ROW.
THE PISTONS LOOKED LIKE THEY 
WERE OUTCLASSED LAST YEAR AND 
FORCED A SEVEN-GAME SERIES. 
THIS YEAR MIAMI LOOKED LIKE 
THEY HAD NO SHOT. 
THEY COME BACK AND WIN IT IN 
SIX.
THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF BOTH 
THESE SERIES, WE THOUGHT, WOW, 
HAD BAD -- HOW BAD FOR THE 
LEAGUE, HOW BAD FOR THE SERIES. 
BOTH TEAMS CHANGED AROUND 
COMPLETELY, WHY IS THAT?
>> WELL, COACHES SAY EACH GAME 
IS SELF-CONTAINED IN THE 
FINALS, AND THERE'S SO MUCH 
ATTENTION NOW.
EVERYTHING IS EXAGGERATED.
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE IS REALLY 
A FINE LINE.
AND IF IT'S LATE IN THE GAME, A 
COUPLE OF POSSESSIONS GET AWAY 
FROM YOU AND A TEAM KNOWS THAT 
IT HAS TO DO SOME DESPERATE 
THINGS TO TRY TO CATCH UP TO 
WIN, SUDDENLY YOU HAVE AN 
EIGHT, 12-POINT GAME AND YOU'RE 
GOING, GEEZ, HOW CAN THIS TEAM 
STAY WITH THEM. 
AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE THE GAP 
GOING BACK AND AN EXTRA DAY TO 
ANALYZE IT AND PROBABLY 
OVERANALYZE IT, YOU DON'T SEE 
WHAT CAN HAPPEN.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE 
TO SEE THESE KINDS OF THINGS. 
BY AND LARGE THESE TEAMS ARE 
GOING TO BE PRETTY EVEN WHEN 
THEY GET TO THIS POINT. 
>> WHAT DOES THIS DO TO PAT 
RILEY'S LEGACY? 
>> IF IT NEEDED S CEMENTING, 
THIS WAS IT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 
DURING THE COURSE OF THE SERIES 
IT WAS BROUGHT UP AND SOMEONE 
SUGGESTED THAT REALLY THIS TEAM 
HAS LESS EXPECTATIONS THAN THE 
ONES YOU TOOK TO CHAMPIONSHIPS 
IN L.A. OR THE ONE YOU TRIED TO 
WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP WITH IN NEW 
YORK. 
AND HE CORRECTED HIM VERY 
QUICKLY AND SAID, LOOK, NO TEAM 
HAS HAD MORE EXPECTATIONS ON IT 
THAN THIS ONE.
BECAUSE THIS WAS A FRANCHISE 
LAST YEAR THAT CAME ONE GAME 
SHORT OF ADVANCING TO THE 
FINALS. 
I DECIDED TO TEAR THE WHOLE 
THING UP AND BRING IN ALL THESE 
PEOPLE. 
I WOULD ARGUE THERE WAS MORE -- 
THERE WERE MORE EXPECTATIONS ON 
THIS TEAM THAN ANY OTHER I'VE 
EVER COACHED. 
DURING THE REGULAR SEASON IT 
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN FOR THEM. 
I BELIEVE THEY WERE 2-14 
AGAINST TEAMS THAT WON THE 
DIVISION AND ALSO THROW THE 
MAVERICKS IN THERE AS WELL. 
AND FOR THEM TO COME TOGETHER 
IN THE PLAYOFFS, IT REALLY IS 
SURPRISING IN A LOT OF WAYS.
>> SHAQ CALLED RILEY THE BEST 
COACH HE'S EVER HAD.
WAS HE CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT? 
NOT THAT HE MIGHT NOT THINK 
THAT. 
BUT I WAS WAITING FOR PHIL 
JACKSON MENTIONED SOMEWHERE, 
AND IT NEVER QUITE HAPPENED.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
>> HE HAS SAID THAT.
HE REALLY RESPECTS PAT, AND 
SHAQ IS A HISTORIAN OF THE 
GAME, IF YOU WILL, AND HE KNOWS 
WHAT PAT RILEY DID WITH KAREEM 
ABDUL-JABBAR AT THE END OF HIS 
CAREER, WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO 
WITH PATRICK EWING IN NEW YORK. 
AND I THINK SHAQ GRAVITATES 
TOWARD THAT.
AND FOR THIS POINT OF HIS 
CAREER, I THINK HE FEELS THAT 
PAT IS THE BEST GUY THAT HE 
COULD HAVE. 
>> ARE THE MAVS AT THIS LEVEL 
TO STAY, DAVID? 
>> THAT'S INTERESTING.
TEAMS THAT LOSE IN A YOUNG 
NUCLEUS, LIKE THE MAVERICKS, 
THEY SAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT 
THAT NEXT YEAR WE CAN BE THERE. 
I THINK YOU CAN MAKE A STRONG 
ARGUMENT THAT THEY MAY BE 
BETTER EQUIPPED NEXT YEAR TO 
WIN A TITLE.
WHEN YOU'RE UP 2-0, YOU'RE UP 
13 POINTS ON THE ROAD WITH SIX 
MINUTES LEFT AND YOU'VE 
DOMINATED THE SERIES AT THAT 
POINT, TO GO FROM THAT TO 
LOSING, I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE 
NEXT YEAR, IF THEY ARE ABLE TO 
GET BACK, THAT IT'S GOING TO BE 
SET UP BETTER FOR THEM THAN 
WHAT IT WAS RIGHT NOW.
>> DAVID, WE APPRECIATE YOUR 
TIME. 
GOOD TALKING TO YOU.
>> THANKS A LOT.
>> THANK YOU. 
DAVID MOORE OF THE "DALLAS 
MORNING NEWS" JOINING US HERE 
ON "THE HOTLIST." 
WHEN WE RETURN, THEYTOR IT -- 
TORE IT UP, PUT IT BACK 
TOGETHER. 
JOE SHEEHAN AND A LOOK AT THE 
MARLINS.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.
>> TIME TO TALK A LITTLE 
BASEBALL. 
JOE SHEEHAN OF 
BASEBALLPROSPECTUS.COM JOINS US 
ON "THE HOTLIST." 
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> I'M DOING FINE.
>> IT'S A CHANCE FOR US TO TALK 
A LITTLE MARLINS BASEBALL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEIR 
M.O.? 
PARING DOWN A TEAM, YOU GET RID 
OF YOUR VETERANS BEFORE THEY'RE 
WASHED UP.
THEY DO IT EARLIER, WHILE THE 
VETERANS STILL HAVE MARKET 
VALUE.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE 
WAY THEY TORE IT APART THIS 
TIME. 
? 
IT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION.
THIS FRANCHISE HAS DONE IT 
TWICE NOW.
SO THERE ARE BUSINESS ISSUES 
THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY 
BASEBALL ISSUES.
JUST FROM A BASEBALL 
STANDPOINT, NOT ONLY WAS IT THE 
RIGHT DECISION, THEY DID A 
GREAT JOB.
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE LAST YEAR 
THAT SAID IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
AN 83-WIN TEAM, YOU'RE BETTER 
OFF PARING IT DOWN SO YOU CAN 
WIN 95 TO 100 GAMES IN THREE 
YEARS.
SO THAT'S WHAT THE MARLINS HAVE 
DONE HERE.
AND THEY DID A BETTER JOB THIS 
TIME THAN THEY DID BACK IN 
1998. 
THE TALENT THAT THEY PICKED UP 
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS 
MUCH BETTER THAN THE TALENT 
THEY PICKED UP TRADING OFF ALOU 
AND THOSE GUYS. 
ALL TOLD, YOU CAN DEFINITELY 
SEE THE CORE OF WHAT'S GOING TO 
BE A WINNING TEAM.
>> YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT BLUE 
CHIP PROSPECTS ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH.
JACOBS IS HITTING, HERMIDA, IF 
HE'S HEALTHY, HE'S GOING TO BE 
SOMETHING.
RAMIREZ, AND UGGLA TURNED OUT 
TO BE SOMETHING.
ARE THEY ALL AT THE ALL-STAR 
LEVEL?
>> NO, MIKE JACOBS IS GOING TO 
BE A SORENTO TYPE PLAYER. 
HE CAN PLAY THE POSITION. 
YOU'RE SEEING HIS PEEK RIGHT 
NOW.
UGGLA WAS NEVER A TOP CHAIR 
PROS PECULIAR.
BUT RAMIREZ HAS BEEN A 
SURPRISE. 
HE'S SHOWN A LOST POWER, WHICH 
HAS REALLY BEEN A SURPRISE. 
HE'S PLAYED THE POSITION. 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GUY WHO 
COULD BE AN ALL-STAR FOR A 
NUMBER OF YEARS TO COME.
JEREMY HERMIDA YOU AND I ARE 
BOTH HIGH ON. 
INJURY HAS REALLY AFFECTED HIS 
SEASON. 
HERMIDA AND RAMIREZ ARE GOING 
TO BE THE CORE GUYS GOING 
FORWARD.
I THINK THEY NEED TO HANG ON TO 
MIGUEL CABRERA AS WELL. 
THEY HAVE SO MUCH PITCHING 
COMING THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT 
YOU CAN SEE THEM BEING THE 
LEAGUE LEADERS IN PITCHING AND 
DEFENSE TWO OR THREE YEARS OUT. 
>> I KNOW JARED WEAVER TO THE 
MINORS, THIS HAPPENED, I GUESS, 
OVER THE WEEKEND, WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT IT. 
YOUR VIEW OF THAT.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE TO 
BE DONE WHEN YOU HAVE A GUY 
WITH A 1.40 REAR, I KNOW IT'S 
HIS BROTHER, BUT ISN'T THERE A 
ROSTER SPOT SOMEWHERE?
>> THE ANGELS HAVE SUCH DEEP 
PITCHING, THAT, NO. 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE WEAVER 
TO THE BULLPEN. 
COLOGNE, ESCOBAR, THEY'VE GOT 
THE DEEP ROTATION.
YOU'RE BETTER OFF HOLDING ON TO 
WEAVER FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER, 
SEE IF HE CAN STRAIGHTEN OUT. 
HE CAN TURN OUT TO HAVE TRADE 
VALUE AT THE DEADLINE AS 
OPPOSED TO LETTING HIM GO.
I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT 
DECISION FROM A TEAM STANDPOINT 
TO HOLD ON FOR ANOTHER SIX 
WEEKS WITH JEFF WEAVER, SEE IF 
THEY CAN GET SOMETHING FROM 
HIM.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL. 
>> REALLY?
>> NO.
>> COST THEM A FEW WINS?
>> OVER FOUR STARTS, MAYBE IT 
COSTS YOU ONE WIN.
I ALSO THINK THAT JEFF WEAVER 
WHO'S LOOKED BAD THIS SEASON, 
HE'S A GOOD ENOUGH PITCHER. 
HE CAN STILL BE AN EFFECTIVE 
MAJOR LEAGUE STARTING PITCHER.
>> THE ALL-STAR GAME MEANS HOME 
FIELD ADVANTAGE IN THE WORLD 
SERIES. 
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.
>> I COULDN'T CARE LESS.
THIS IS A GIMMICK.
THE ALL-STAR GAME IS AN 
EXHIBITION. 
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
>> SO AT THE END OF THE GAME -- 
THINK ABOUT THE ENDS OF AN 
ALL-STAR GAME WHEN ALL THOSE 
TOKEN GUYS FROM THE ROYALS AND 
THE DEVIL RAYS AND THE PIRATES 
AND THE ROCKIES ARE IN THERE. 
>> THEY'RE TOKEN ALL-STARS. 
>> DOES IT REALLY MATTER TO -- 
WHO'S GOING TO BE THE TOKEN 
ROYALS ALL-STAR?
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE HOME 
FIELD ADVANTAGE COMING DOWN TO 
GREDS LANIC?
THIS IS A GIMMICK.
THE ALL-STAR GAME, THE REASON 
THE ALL-STAR GAME NEEDS US NOW 
IS BECAUSE THE DELINEATIONS TO 
THE LEAGUES HAVE BEEN 
ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY. 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE SENSE OF 
SEPARATE LEAGUES ANYMORE. 
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO DO 
THIS. 
LEAGUES USED TO HATE EACH 
OTHER, BRIAN. 
NOW THERE'S NO SENSE OF THIS 
THAT MATTERS. 
WHAT YOU HAD WAS PEOPLE SAID 
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO GET INTO THE 
GAME, WHICH YOU STILL HAVE. 
IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY MAKE 
THIS GAME COUNT AND ACTUALLY 
HAVE THE TRUE ALL-STARS, THE 
BEST PLAYERS IN THE GAME, PLAY 
SIX OR SEVEN INNINGS. 
>> SO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT 
ASPECT OF THE FORMAT, NOT 
ATTACHING SIGNIFICANCE TO IT. 
>> IT SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT 
ENOUGH TO HAVE THE BEST PLAYERS 
IN BASEBALL PLAYING IN AN 
EXHIBITION GAME.
IF YOU HAVE TO SPEIST IT UP, 
DON'T GO A.L./N.L.
MAKE IT U.S. INTERNATIONAL, 
MAKE IT GUYS WHO PLAY FOR TEAMS 
THAT WEAR PINSTRIPES VERSUS 
TEAMS THAT WEAR SOLIDS. 
>> IT'S STILL REFLECTIVE OF THE 
LEAGUE'S DEPTH, THOUGH, DON'T 
YOU THINK?
IF IT'S GREZZ LANIC WHO 
REFLECTS IT --
>> THINK ABOUT A WEAK TEAM IN 
YOUR LEAGUE.
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES. 
EVERY LEAGUE HAS A WEAK TEAM. 
>> RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH THOSE GUYS, TOO. 
>> THAT'S A RIDICULOUS WAY TO 
DECIDE WHO GETS HOME FIELD 
ADVANTAGE IN THE ALL-STAR GAME. 
YOU HAVE THE WORST PLAYER ON 
THE WORST TEAMS.
>> NO, YOU HAVE THE BEST PLAYER 
ON THE WORST TEAM.
IF THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS OUT, 
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS OUT.
>> BRIAN, IT'S TERRIBLE.
>> IT'S NOT TERRIBLE. 
I WOULD CHANGE THE FORMAT.
>> WHERE'S ELLIOTT? 
>> THAT'S IT, YOU'RE GONE.
I WOULD WHANG CHANGE THE FORMAT 
BUT I WOULDN'T CHANGE THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF IT. 
AS FAR AS HAVING IT MEAN 
SOMETHING, IT ADDS SO MUCH MORE 
TO THE GAME.
>> WHY CAN'T IT MEAN WATCHING 
THE BEST PLAYERS ON ONE FIELD 
AT ONE TIME?
>> NOBODY CARED ENOUGH ANYMORE. 
IT'S NOT SPECIAL ANYMORE. 
>> GIVE ME THREE REGULAR SEASON 
GAMES OVER THE ALL-STAR, BRIAN. 
>> I STILL LIKE SEEING THE 
ALL-STAR GAME.
YOU ALSO HAVE THE FUTURES GAME 
COMING UP, THE X.M. SATELLITE 
RADIO ALL-STAR FUTURES GAME 
COMING UP.
GIVE ME THE PROGNOSIS, 
LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS ON SOME OF 
THESE GUYS. 
ALEX GORDON OF KANSAS CITY. 
HOW GOOD OR GREAT WILL HE BE? 
>> PURE HITTER. 
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE DEFENSIVE 
SKILLS. 
YOU'RE TALK ABOUT A GUY WHO'S 
GOING TO START AT THIRD BASE 
AND BE A .300 HITTER. 
A GUY LIKE JIM THOME IS ALREADY 
THE BEST HITTER IN THE ENTIRE 
ROYALS ORGANIZATION.
HE SHOULD BE THEIR ALL-STAR.
>> HOWIE KENDRICK OF THE 
ANGELS. 
CAME UP, I GUESS IT WASN'T GOOD 
ENOUGH FOR HIM. 
HOW GOOD IS THIS GUY? 
>> THEY MESSED AROUND WITH HIM. 
HE DOESN'T WALK A WHOLE LOT.
BUT HE IS A LEGITIMATE .340 
HITTER, AND THERE AREN'T AWOL 
LOT OF GUYS LIKE THAT.
HE'S -- IF YOU DO THAT, HE'S 
GOING TO BE AN ALL-STAR FOR A 
NUMBER OF YEARS.
>> DREW FOR THE DIAMONDBACKS. 
>> HE'S MORE OF A POLISHED 
PRODUCT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT 
TIME THAT OTHER GUYS HAVE, BUT 
HE CAN PROBABLY BE A START BE 
SHORTSTOP ON THE MAJOR LEAGUES 
RIGHT NOW.
HITTING AT A .290 LEVEL.
LET'S NOT FORGET, BRIAN, A GUY 
WHO CAN HIT THE BALL WITH POWER 
IS GOING TO LOOK GOOD IN 
ARIZONA.
>> FIPLIP HUGHES. 
HOW GOOD IS HE? 
GOOD HE'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN 
THE RECENT YANKEE PITCHING 
PROSPECTS.
GUYS LIKE WANG HAVE COME ALONG 
AND HAVEN'T BEEN PURE STUFF 
GUYS. 
PHILIP HUGHES IS A PURE STUFF 
GUY.
HE'S STAYED HEALTHY SO FAR AND 
I THINK THE YANKEES WILL HOLD 
ON TO HIM THROUGH THE TRADE 
DEADLINE. 
HE'LL BE IN THE PROTATION EARLY 
NEXT YEAR.
>> JOE, GOOD HAVING YOU ON HERE 
DESPITE YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS.
>> I DON'T FORGET A THING.
BYE-BYE, JOE. 
>> TAKE CARE, BRIAN.

CONTINUED ON THE FLIGHT HOME 
FROM DALLAS, WHERE COACH PAT 
RILEY SAID HIS TEAM DRANK 22 
BOTTLES OF CRYSTAL AFTER 
WINNING THE FIRST-EVER 
CHAMPIONSHIP IN FRANCHISE 
HISTORY.
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE 
FESS VISITS WON'T BE 
INTERRUPTED BY A LITTLE THING 
LIKE REST.
RILEY SAID, QUOTE, WE'LL SLEEP

RILEY AND THE MIAMI HEAT 
ARRIVED JUST BEFORE 7:00 A.M. 
SHAQ WAS CARRYING THE TROPHY 
THAT HE PROMISED THE FANS.
A PARADE IS SCHEDULED FOR FRY 
DRAY FROM 2-5 EASTERN IN 
DOWNTOWN MIAMI. 
THE ENGLISH TEAM WILL PLAY THE 
REMAINDER OF THE WORLD CUP 
WITHOUT MICHAEL OWEN. 
A SCAN REVEALED A TORN RIGHT 
A.C.L.
WITHOUT OWEN ENGLAND HAS THREE 
STRIKERS LEFT, ONE OF WHICH IS 
A 17-YEAR-OLD WITH VERY LIMITED 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE. 
OWEN'S RIGHT KNEE BUCKLED AFTER 
HE PLAYED A PASS. 
HE WAS TREATED BY DOCTORS AND 
CARRIED OFF THE FEEL ON A 
STRETCHER.
THE 26-YEAR-OLD SAID HE KNEW HE 
WAS IN TROUBLE AS SOON AS IT 
HAPPENED. 
ENGLAND PLAYS ECUADOR IN THE 
SECOND ROUND ON SUNDAY. 
ACTION FROM TODAY.
MEXICO HASN'T LOST IN THE FIRST 
ROUND OF THE WORLD CUP SINCE 
1994. 
PORTUGAL HAS ALREADY CLINCHED A 
BERTH IN THE ROUND OF 16. 
THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE ADVANCED 
BEYOND GROUP PLAY SINCE 1996. 
MEXICO NEED ADD WIN OR A TIE 
TODAY TO ADVANCE. 
SIXTH MINUTE, NO SCORE. 
SO SIMAO DRAWING DEFENSE. 
1-0 PORTUGAL. 
LATER, FIRST HALF STILL 1-0.
MARQUEZ, SETS UP A PENALTY SHOT 
FOR SIMAO.
WATCH AS HE HESITATES ON THE 
MOVE, THEN SCORES ON THE 
PENALTY KICK. 
IT'S 2-0 PORTUGAL.
SECOND HALF, MEXICO DOWN 2-0. 
HANDBALL CALLED ON MIGUEL.
PORTUGAL IN THE BOX.
PENALTY SHOT. 
THIS TIME IT'S OMAR BRAVO DOING 
THE HONOR.
BRAVO'S PENALTY SHOT SAILING 
OVER THE TOP. 
PORTUGAL WINS 2-1, TAKING ALL 
THREE FIRST ROINEDS GAMES IN 
GROUP D.
THEY ALLOWED JUST SIX GOALS 
OVER THAT STRESH. 
MEXICO WILL PLAY THE GROUP C 
WINNER.
>> ANGOLA ON THE CHARGE.
FLAVIO USING HIS HEAD.
ANGOLA SCORING ITS FIRST-EVER 
WORLD CUP GOAL AND THEY TAKE A 
1-0 LEAD. 
75TH MINUTE, IRAN WITH A CORNER 
KICK. 
THEY'RE DOWN 1-0. 
HOW ABOUT ANOTHER HITTER, HOW 
ABOUT ANOTHER GOAL? 
WE NOW GO TO STOPPAGE TIME. 
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WIN. 
THE EASY SAVE THERE.
GAME ENDS IN A 1-1 DRAW.
ANGOLA WILL NOT ADVANCE TO THE 
NEXT ROUND. 
IRAN'S RUN AT THE WORLD CUP IS 
ALSO OVER AS YOU CAN SEE THE 
STANDINGS IN GROUP D.

STRAIGHT GAMES. 
HE'S PLANNING TO GO FOR AN

ALOU SAID, QUOTE, HE WAS A 
LITTLE CONCERNED THAT HE MIGHT 
BE HEADING BACK TO THE DISABLED 
LIST. 
TIME NOW TO GET YOU NEWS WIRED. 
10 DAYS AFTER A NORTHWESTERN 
UNIVERSITY INVESTIGATION 
CONCLUDED THAT A HAZING 
INCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE 
WOMEN'S SOCCER PROGRAM, THE 
HEAD COACH HAS RESIGNED.
>> THAT'S A NICE WAY OF PUTTING 
YOU'RE OUT. 
WHAT ASSIGNMENT.
WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT GET OUT. 
YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING TO 
MISS A PENALTY SHOT, BUT TO 
MISS IT LIKE THAT.
WE'RE HUMAN, EVEN A TOP PLAYER. 
BUT MAN, WHAT A MISS. 
THAT'S ABOUT THE WORST MISS 
YOU'LL EVER SEE.
DANYELLE, THANK YOU.
WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK WORLD 
CUP.
ALLAN HOPKINS IS GOING TO JOIN

WELL, THEN TECHNICALLY
THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS A KISS.
OH, COME ON!

NO, THANKS, HOLLYWOOD.

OF MILLER LITE.
ALWAYS A GOOD CALL.
>> WE RETURN HERE ON "THE 
HOTLIST." 
ALENHOPKINS JOIN US RIGHT NOW.
IF YOU SEE HIS EYES GAZING 
UPWARD, HE'S WATCHING 
ARGENTINA.
LET'S GET ALL THESE GAMES IN. 
PORTUGAL, HOW GOOD ARE THEY?
>> VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.
THIS IS A TEAM THAT HASN'T DONE 
VERY WELL IN THE WORLD CUP 
SINCE 1966. 
THEY HAD THE SO-CALLED GOLDEN 
GENERATION, NOW LED BY FIGO.
HE'S PLAYING AS WELL AS ANY 
INDIVIDUAL PLAYER IN THIS 
TOURNAMENT. 
THEY SCORED SOME VERY GOOD 
GOALS TODAY THAT GOT RENALDO 
PLAYING VERY WELL, ALL THEIR 
BIG GUNS ARE PLAYING VERY WELL. 
THE HEAD COACH OF PORTUGAL DOES 
NOT GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES. 
HE'S NOW ONE OF THREE COACHES 
THAT HAVE WON AT LEAST 10 WORLD 
CUP GAMES.
THEY'VE DONE VERY WELL IN THE 
TOURNAMENT. 
>> THEY WERE PLAYING 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, RIGHT?
PORTUGAL AND MEXICO WAS 
PLAYING, SO IRAN AND ANGOLA ARE 
PLAYING AT THE SAME TIME. 
SO THERE WAS NO RESTING, 
THINKING WE'RE ALREADY IN.
HOW DID THAT UNFOLD?
>> WELL, THE REAL BACKGROUND 
STORY IS YEARS AGO FIFA DECIDED 
THEY HAD TO PLAY THE MATCHES 
SIMULTANEOUSLY BECAUSE THERE'S 
A LOT OF FUNNY BUSINESS GOING 
ON. 
TO SEEP THE INTEGRITY OF THESE 
MATCHES, THEY PLAY THEM 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 
AND THE BIG DRAMA WAS ANGOLA 
WAS WINNING, AND THEY NEEDED TO 
WIN BY A COUPLE OF GOALS. 
MEXICO MISSED A KICK THAT COULD 
HAVE TIED IT AT 2-2.
ONCE THEY FOUND OUT IRAN HAD 
SCORED, THEY SEEMED TO REALIZE 
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BACK 
THEMSELVES INTO THE ROUND OF 
16, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
>> THE MISSED PENALTY SHOT. 
I UNDERSTAND ANYBODY CAN MISS A 
PENALTY SHOT. 
BUT THAT'S BIG. 
30 FEET UP ABOVE THE CROSSBAR.
HOW DO YOU VIEW THAT AS A 
PLAYER? 
>> WELL, YOU REALLY -- IT'S SO 
BAD THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO 
SHAKE IT OFF. 
IT WILL BE IN THE BACK OF THEIR 
MINDS.
MEXICO HAS HAD A POOR HISTORY 
OF TAKING PENALTIES IN THE 
WORLD CUP.
I DON'T KNOW WHY. 
BUT OVER THE YEARS THEY'VE 
ALWAYS COME UP SHORT ON 
PENALTIES.
AND FOR MANY MEXICAN FANS THAT 
WAS ANOTHER PENALTY KICK. 
>> NETHERLANDS VERSUS 
ARGENTINA.
IF THIS HAD BEEN ON THE LINE, 
IF THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING AT 
STAKE -- WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO 
DO A LIVE LOOK-IN HERE. 
HAD THERE BEEN SOMETHING ON THE 
LINE, HOW HARD WOULD THIS HAVE 
BEEN? 
>> EVERYONE WAS LOOKING FORWARD 
TO IT.
ARGENTINA, NETHERLANDS. 
ROYALTY, REALLY, OF WORLD CUP 
FOOTBALL. 
BUT THE QUESTION IS THIS. 
NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING 
ON, YOU HAVE TO REST PLAYERS, 
YOU HAVE TO THINK AHEAD.
THE NETHERLANDS HAVE SEMPLE 
PLAYERS ON YELLOW CARDS SO THEY 
DON'T WANT TO SPEND IT FOR THE 
NEXT ROUND. 
ARGENTINA PLAYING SECOND-TIER 
PLAYERS.
THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT 
SEPARATES THESE TWO TEAMS.
SO EVEN THOUGH THE SENSE OF 
URGENCY IS NOT THERE, I THINK 
BOTH TEAMS STILL WANT TO GO OUT 
AND PUT ON A GOOD SHOWING.
AND ACTUALLY, FOR THE COACHES, 
THEY PROBABLY REALLY ENJOY 
PLAYING AGAINST A HIGH-QUALITY 
OPPONENT BUT NOT HAVING TO PLAY 
FOR EVERYTHING ON THE LINE. 
>> AGAIN, THIS IS A LIVE 
LOOK-IN.
YOU ARE LOOKING LIVE AT THE 
NETHERLANDS VERSUS ARGENTINA. 
THE NETHERLANDS, I GUESS, HAVE 
REGROUPED.
THEY HAD VERY GOOD SQUADS, YET, 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN BACK TO THE 
TOP, BUT THEY WERE THERE 20, 30 
YEARS AGO.
HOW DEEP ARE THEY?
>> THEY HAVE A GREAT YOUNG 
PLAYER, A TEENAGER. 
WHAT HAS TROUBLED THE 
NETHERLANDS IS THEY HAVE 
TERRIBLE TEAM CHEMISTRY.
THEY HAVE SO MANY INDIVIDUALS 
THAT ARE CONSTANTLY SHAKING THE 
TREE, UPSETTING THE APPLE CART. 
AND NOW THEY'VE COME INTO THIS 
TOURNAMENT WITHOUT ANY MAJOR 
LOCKER ROOM DISTRACTIONS, AND 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY'RE 
PLAYING AS WELL AS THEY HAVE. 
AND ARGENTINA WITH SO MANY 
TALENTED YOUNG PLAYERS, THEY'RE 
FEELING LIKE THEY'RE HITTING 
THEIR GROOVE AND THEIR STRIDE 
AS WELL.
THIS WILL BE A MATCH THAT BOTH 
TEAMS WILL BE HAPPY WITH NO 
MATTER THE OUTCOME. 
THEY GET A CHANCE TO TEST 
THEMSELVES AGAINST A 
HIGH-QUALITY OPPONENT WITHOUT 
NECESSARILY LEAVING IT ALL OUT 
ON THE LINE.
>> THIS IS STOPPAGE TIME HERE 
IN THE FIRST HALF.
GOING INTO THE NEXT ONE, UNLESS 
WE HAD A GOOD FREE KICK THERE 
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT 
WE'RE GOING TO GET. 
MICHAEL OWEN, A BRILLIANT 
PLAYER, TORN A.C.L., DONE.
HOW BAD FOR ENGLAND?
>> IT'S A TERRIBLE BLOW FOR 
OWEN AND ENGLAND. 
THE ONLY PLAYER THAT ENGLAND 
REALLY HAD TO REALLY LOOK 
TOWARD IN TERMS OF HAVING DONE 
THIS BEFORE ON THE BIG STAGE IS 
MICHAEL OWEN. 
I'VE ALWAYS SAID THIS.
NONCONTACT INJURIES IN THIS 
GAME ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST.
>> HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
DID HIS KNEE JUST BUCKLE? 
>> IT'S TIMING. 
THERE WAS NO MECHANISM, AS YOU 
SAW.
IT WAS TIME FOR HIS KNEE TO GO. 
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN IN 
HIS TOP FORM AND NOT BEEN 
INJURY-FREE, HE'S THE ONE 
PLAYER THAT THE OTHER COACHES 
HAVE TO GAME PLAN FOR.
INSTEAD OF HAVING TWO WORLD 
CLASS STRIKERS LIKE RUDY AND 
OWEN, NOW YOU HAVE CROUCH WHO'S 
GETTING A CHANCE TO PLAY AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL ALONGSIDE ROONEY, 
WHO'S COMING BACK.
RIGHT NOW THAT'S A BIG BLOW FOR 
ENGLAND.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON PAPER, 
OWEN HAS NOT BEEN CLICKIN ON 
ALL CYLINDERS FOR THEM. 
>> TOMORROW, U.S. VERSUS GHANA. 
WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR 
EARLY?
YOU MENTIONED LOOK FOR TEAM 
SPEED FOR GHANA AND THE U.S. 
HAS NOT HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT 
YET.
WHAT SHOULD A FAN BE LOOKING 
FOR?
>> THE BIG KEY IS SHAPING UP, 
BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TWO 
STRIKERS FOR GHANA THAT ARE 
SUSPENDED, THEY REALLY HAVE TO 
STEP UP THEIR GAME. 
THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY READY. 
SOMETIMES WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW 
DOESN'T HURT YOU. 
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO GO FOR 
EVERYTHING AND THEY HAVE TO 
SCORE GOALS.
AND ANOTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL 
FACTOR, NOW THAT ALL THE 
AFRICAN TEAMS ARE OUT, THEY'RE 
PULLING FOR GHANA.
BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO CONTROL 
THEIR PLAYER, AND WHEREVER HE 
IS ON THE FIELD YOU HAVE TO 
WATCH HIM.
AND THE TEAM SPEED, THAT'S WHY 
I LOOK FOR EDDIE JOHNSON TO GET 
HIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE WHEN 
ALL THE LIGHTS COME UP AT THE 
WORLD CUP AND DO WHAT HE DOES 
BEST, WHICH IS PERFORMING WHEN 
IT MATTERS MOST.
>> ALLEN HOPKINS HERE ON THE 
WORLD CUP.
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK. 
WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL TALK A 
LITTLE BASEBALL.
ERIC KARABELL WILL JOIN US

ERIC KARABELL JOINS US HERE 
FROM ESPN.COM.
WAIVER WIRE WEDNESDAY.
>> LOVE IT. 
>> SHOULD I GET JASON KUBEL?
>> GOT TO MAKE A MOVE RIGHT 
NOW.
>> HOW EXCITING.
>> AMERICA WAITS FOR THIS MOVE. 
>> DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO 
HAVE SUCCESS AGAINST CLEMENS? 
>> PROBABLY NOT.
>> SO I HAVE CLEMENS, TOO.
>> SO IT'S A WIN-WIN. 
>> OR IT'S A LOSE-LOSE. 
I CAN'T CONTROL IT EITHER WAY.
>> KUBEL GOES 0-4, BUT CLEMENS 
GIVES UP 10 RUNS. 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEEL?
>> THAT'S BAD.
YOU PLAY THE PERCENTAGE.
>> PICK UP A RELIEVER, A CLOSER 
TYPE. 
>> REALLY?
NO. 
>> YOU DON'T GET IT.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DON'T GET 
IT? 
>> YOU DON'T GET IT.
>> WHAT DON'T I GET?
WHAT DON'T I GET? 
REALLY. 
>> WHY PICK UP A RELIEVER?
YOU CAN'T GET SAVES OUT OF THE 
GUY.
THE CHANCES OF KUBEL OVER 
CLEMENS ARE PROBABLY SLIM.
>> YOU NEED ANOTHER RUN.
>> WHAT ABOUT IF THAT MIDDLE 
RELIEVER GETS A WIN?
>> YOU KNEE THAT GOOD INNING OF 
RELIEF. 
>> NO, I DON'T NEED RELIEF. 
>> THAT'S BAD STRATEGY. 
HOW MANY OF THESE THINGS HAVE 
YOU WON?
>> A LOT. 
>> IT'S YOUR TEAM, THOUGH.
JOEY GATHRIGHT GETS DEALT.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIM?
>> I THINK WE CAN MAKE THE 
STATEMENT IF HE PLAYS EVERY DAY 
FOR KANSAS CITY AS HE'S 
SUPPOSED TO, HE MIGHT ACTUALLY 
LEAD THE MAJOR LEAGUES IN 
STEALS FROM THIS POINT OUT. 
IF HE'S OUT THERE AS A FREE 
AGENT, GET HIM RIGHT NOW. 
HE HAS 12 STEALS. 
HIS NUMBERS WEREN'T GREAT WITH 
TAMPA BAY, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS 
LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER.
TRADED TO KANSAS CITY LATE LAST 
NIGHT.
HE'S GOING TO PLAY SFEEFLED.
GATHRIGHT IS ABOUT AS FAST AS 
ANYBODY IN BASEBALL.
I CAN SEE HIM STEALING A COUPLE 
OF BASES PER WEEK.
GET HIM NOW.
>> NOT JASON KUBEL? 
>> KUBEL IS GREAT, TOO. 
THEY DO DIFFERENT THINGS. 
I LIKE KUBEL. 
>> I ALREADY DID. 
IT'S IN NOW.
>> I DON'T GET THE MIDDLE 
RELIEF STRATEGY.
>> IN YOUR TEAM, WHERE YOU HAVE 
ALL-STARTING PITCHING, IT MAKES 
LITTLE SINCE. 
>> KUBEL, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING 
TO DUMP HIM THE NEXT DAY. 
>> PROBABLY.
SETH MCCLUNG, YOU SEE BIG 
NUMBERS.
WOULD YOU PICK HIM UP IF 
>> YOU WOULDN'T CARE IN YOUR 
LEAGUE. 
HE'S BEING SENT DOWN TO THE 
MINOR LEAGUES TO LEARN HOW TO 
BE A CLOSER.
THE GUY THROWS 95 HEAT, GREAT 
ARM.
HE DONE HAVE A GOOD NUMBER GO 
PITCH.
HE'S A FAILED STARTER WHO'S 
GOING TO GO TO THE BULLPEN. 
IN TWO WEEKS HE'S GOING TO BE 
UP AND CLOSING FOR TAMPA BAY. 
I THINK SETH MCCLUNG COULD BE A 
DECENT CLOSER.
TYLER WALKER WOULD BE ON THE 
WAY OUT.
MCCLUNG, IF YOU CAN GET HIM IN 
A DEEP LEAGUE AND STASH HIM 
AWAY. 
>> MATT KAHNE HAS BEEN 
BRILLIANT, THEN SHAKY.
WOULD YOU PICK HIM UP?
>> IN THE INTERLEAGUE HE'S 
ALLOWED TWO HITS. 
HIS E.R.A. IS OVER SIX. 
HE'LL GET BETTER AS THE SEASON 
GOES ON AS A YOUNG PITCHER. 
MAKES A LOT OF MISTAKES.
I THINK HE'LL BE MORE 
COMFORTABLE IN THE SECOND HALF. 
YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO WANT HIS 
TEAMMATE. 
I THINK THE GIANTS ARE GOING TO 
GET BETTER IN THE SECOND HALF.
GET THESE GUYS NOW. 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE GOOD 
NUMBERS.
YOU CAN SEE IT COMING.
HE HAD A ONE-HITTER A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS.
>> JOHN LEE?
>> HE'S ON THE DID. 
L., AND NOBODY OWNS HIM.
GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE. 
1.29 E.R.A. RIGHT NOW.
THAT DOESN'T JIBE.
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT JON 
LIEBER'S BEEN UNLUCKY.
HE WILL GET BETTER. 
JON LIEBER, A GREAT SECOND-HALF 
OPTION WHO YOU CAN GET FOR 
BASICALLY NOTHING RIGHT NOW.
HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN 20 GAMES, 
BUT HE WILL GET BETTER. 
HE'S NOT GOING TO FINISH WITH 
AN E.R.A. NEAR 6.00.
GET HIM NOW BEFORE HE COMES OFF 
THE D.L.
>> HIS PERCENTAGES AREN'T GOOD, 
BUT HIS TOTALS IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THAT LINEUP IN ST. LOUIS COULD 
BE BRET TEE GOOD. 
>> HAD SOME BIG DAYS. 
DOUBLE DIDN'T IN HOME RUNS. 
PROBABLY ON HIS WAY TO 90 
R.B.I.'S. 
NOT A BAD PLAYER AT ALL.
HIS AVERAGE IS A LITTLE BIT 
INFLATED RIGHT NOW. 
NOT A BIG BASE FIELD RIGHT NOW. 
I DON'T GET IT. 
HE'S GOT 10 HOMERS, PRETT SAFE 
STATS.
GET HIM, GET HIM. 
HE'S SAFE.
LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.
HE'S SAFER THAN GONZALEZ. 
>> ADRIAN GONZALEZ FOR THE 
BAURDS. 
>> THEE HOMERS IN THE LAST FOUR 
GAMES.
DEVELOPING POWER. 
EVEN IN SAN DIEGO, VERY TOUGH 
HITTER'S PARK.
I THINK HE'S GOING TO HIT ABOUT 
20 HRLS.
UP HE'S UP TO 10 ALREADY. 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ SHOULD BE ON 
MORE LEAGUES, IF AT ALL, FOR 
THE 10 HOME RUNS. 
HE'S NOT A BAD PLAYER, AND NEXT 
YEAR HE DEVELOPS THAT CHAD 
TRACY TYPE POWER, 20 TO 25 
HOMERS. 
>> MIKE NAPOLI. 
>> SEVEN HOME RUNS, AND THEY'RE 
SO DESPERATE FOR POWER, THAT 
THEY BATTED HIM FIFTH.
THERE'S NOBODY TO PROTECT HIM.
NAPOLI IS A DECENT ADDITION.
THE MOST HOME RUNS FOR ANY 
CATCHER IS 10.
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL PICK HIM 
UP AND SEE IF HE'S FOR REAL.
BIG POWER.
HE WHONTS HAD 166 STRIKEOUTS IN 
HIS SEASON IN THE MINORS. 
THE ANGELS ARE GOING TO MAKE A 
TRADE AT SOME POINT AND MOVE 
DOWN IN THE ORDER.
BUT SOMETHING IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN HERE WITH JEFF WEAVER 
ESCOBAR.
OWN NAPOLI FOR NOW, AS CATCHERS 
GO, HE'S DOING VERY WELL. 
>> CATCHING IS DEEPER THAN I 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
AGAIN, WE'RE IN A 10-TEAM 
LEAGUE. 
BUT IT'S DEEPER THAN I THOUGHT. 
ESTRADA HAD BEEN OUT THERE. 
>> IT'S ACTUALLY A DEEP 
POSITION, BUT NO STARS. 
MARTINEZ HASN'T HIT FOR A LOT 
OF POWER. 
10 HOME RUNS IS THE MOST. 
THAT'S AWFULLY LOW. 
EVEN FOR CATCHING.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF DEPTH.
>> THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD PICK 
UP GUYS WHO ARE HOT AND DON'T P 
AFRAID TO DUMP YOUR ESTRADA 
TYPES.
>> THAT'S GOOD STRATEGY.
NOW YOU'RE FINALLY MAKING SOME 
SENSE AROUND HERE.
LET'S TAKE SOME EMAILS.
>> JEREMY IS GOING TO MAKE HIS 
MAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT ON SUNDAY. 
THEY GOT RID OF JOHNSON WHO'S 
NOW A RED SOX.
IF YOU'RE EXPECTING A FIELD IN 
THE SECOND HALF, IT'S NOT GOING 
TO HAPPEN.
PICK HIM UP.
I EXPECT HIM TO BE GOOD.
ALEX GORDON IS IN DOUBLE-A AND 
I EXPECT HIM AFTER SEPTEMBER. 
>> HE'S GOING TO BE IN THE 
FUTURES GAME, THOUGH. 
>> GREAT FUTURE, GREAT FUTURE.
>> THANKS FOR DROPPING BY.

>> IT IS STRANGE WHEN YOU SEE A 
GUY DASHING AND DARTING AND HE 
MAKES A MOVE AND THE KNEE 
BUCKLES.
>> WE START WITH THE NBA. 
MIAMI HEAT CELEBRATION BEGAN ON 
THE COURT AND CONTINUED ON THE 
FLIGHT HOME FROM DALLAS LAST 
NIGHT WHERE COACH PAT RILEY SAID
HIS TEAM DRANK 22 BOTTLES OF 
CHAMPAGNE AFTER WINNING THE 
FIRST TITLE IN HISTORY. 
HE SAID WE ARE NOT SLEEPING.
WE WILL SLEEP IN THE SUMMERTIME.
HE AND THE REST OF THE HEAT 
ARRIVED HOME JUST BEFORE 7:00 
A.M. AND WERE WOKED BY FANS AT 
THE MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
SHAQ WAS CARRYING THE TROPHY. 
A PARADE IS SCHEDULED FOR FRIDAY
. 
THE ENGLISH TEAM WILL PLAY THE 
REMAINED ARE OF THE WORLD CUP 
WITHOUT MICHAEL OWEN WHO LEFT 
TUESDAY WITH A TORN RIGHT A.C.L.
WITHOUT HIM THEY HAVE THREE 
STRIKERS LEFT ONE OF WHICH IS A 
17-YEAR-OLD WITH VERY LIMITED 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE. 
OWEN'S RIGHT KNEE BUCKLED AFTER 
HE PLAYED A PASS. 
HE WAS TREATED BY DOCTORS AND 
CARRIED OFF THE FIELD.
HE SAID HE KNEW HE WAS IN 
TROUBLE AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED. 
THEY PLAY ECUADOR SUNDAY IN THE 
SECOND ROUND.
>> MEXICO NEEDS A WIN OR A TIE 
TO ADVANCE. 
SIXTH MINUTE, NO SCORE. 
THEN PORTUGAL MAKES IT 1-0. 
LATER IN THE FIRST HALF, SAME 
SCORE OFF A PORTUGAL CORNER KICK
RAFAEL MARQUEZ CALLED FOR THIS 
AND A PENALTY SHOT AND SAMAI 
PUTS PORTUGAL UP 2-0. 
THEN RUIZ MIGUEL AND ANOTHER 
PENALTY SHOT. 
SO ALL THE PRESSURE IS ON BRAVO.
NOT EVEN CLOSE. 
SAILING OVER THE TOP OF THE 
GOAL. 
PORTUGAL WINS 2-1 TAKING ALL 
THREE FIRST-ROUND GAMES.
WE HAVE MORE. 
>> PORTUGAL GAME IN THE GAME 
NEEDING JUST A TIE SO THEY 
DECIDED TO DIRECT FIVE OF THE 
STARTERS WITH YELLOW CARDS. 
DIDN'T MATTER, PORTUGAL SCORED 
TWO GOALS AND MEXICO WAS TRYING 
TO CRAWL OUT OF THE HOLE. 
A LITTLE DISCONCERTING FOR 
MEXICO IN THAT THEY WERE NOT 
SHARP IN FRONT OF THE GOAL. 
MISSED A PENALTY KICK.
LUIS PEREZ GOES DOWN FOR HIS 
SECOND YELLOW CARD. 
THEY WILL COME UP IN THE SECOND 
ROUND.
THEY WILL BE UP AGAINST 
ARGENTINA OR THE NETHERLANDS.
>> WITH THE MEXICO LOSS ANGOLA 
COULD ADVANCE TO THE NEXT ROUND.
LOOKING FOR A BIG WIN.
60TH MINUTE.
PLAVIO USES HIS HEAD AND ANGOLA 
SCORES ITS FIRST GOAL EVER. 
THEY TAKE A 1-0 LEAD. 
75TH MINUTE, IRAN, CORNER KICK, 
DOWN 1-0, ANOTHER HEADER TO TIE 
THE GAME 1-1. 
NOW IN STOPPAGE TIME ANGOLA WITH
A FREE COOK, HUGE CHANCE FOR THE
WIN.
ANTONIO MENDANKA MISSES.
ENDS IN A 1-1 TIE.
>> 10TH MINUTE, A NICE MOVE, 
FIRST WORLD CUP GOAL OF HIS 
CAREER. 
20TH MINUTE.
STILL 1-0, ILYICH SCORING 
ANOTHER GOAL. 
SERBIA & MONTENEGRO WITH A 2-0 
LEAD AFTER THAT.
THE SCORE IN THIS ONE CURRENTLY 
IS 2-1.

LOWRY JEFF WEAVER 
>> NO BARRY BONDS IN THE LINE-UP
TODAY.
>> WHEN WE COME BACK WE WILL 
TALK TO ROBIN VENTURA ONE OF THE
BEST THIRD BASEMEN OF THE LAST 
GENERATION.
>> UP NEXT BACK TO OMAHA WITH 
ROBIN VENTURA.
>> OUR NEXT GUEST WAS ONE OF THE
TOP THIRD BASEMEN IN HIS 
GENERATION, HELPED THE METS WIN 
A PENNANT.
AN INAUGURAL INDUCTEE TO THE NEW
COLLEGE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME.
THREE-TIME ALL-AMERICAN AT 
COLLEGE PLAY. 
ROBIN VENTURA.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GREAT. 
>> YOU HAVE A LITTLE AIR 
CONDITIONING. 
>> YES, IT IS HOT HERE. 
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
THEY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT. 
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING A 
COLLEGE BASEBALL HALL OF FAMER. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
IT IS GREAT.
>> YOU HAVE NOT BEEN IN OMAHA IN
SOME TIME, RIGHT? 
>> NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE SINCE
1987. 
IT HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT. 
THEY HAVE A WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OUT
HERE THAT I DON'T REMEMBER 
ACTUALLY. 
THEY HAVE PEOPLE SELLING THINGS 
AND THEY HAVE KIDS DOING A BUNCH
OF STUFF HERE.
>> WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH
OKLAHOMA STATE IN THE COLLEGE 
WORLD SERIES? 
>> IT WAS GREAT.
I THINK THE FIRST TIME YOU COME 
HERE IT IS ONE -- IT IS THE 
FIRST TIME A COLLEGE BASEBALL 
PLAYER AGAINST THE EXPERIENCE 
LIKE A FINAL FOUR BECAUSE ALL 
EIGHT TEAMS ARE HERE AND THEY 
ARE PLAYING ONE AFTER ANOTHER 
PRETTY MUCH.
SO IF YOU ARE SECOND GAME YOU 
HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE FIRST TO 
END AND YOU HEAR ALL THE 
EXCITEMENT IN THE FIRST GAME AND
YOU WANT TO GET IN THERE AND 
PLAY. 
IN IS THE FIRST TIME ON THE 
FIELD IS PROBABLY THE MOST 
EXCITING TIME.
>> YOU HAD THAT 58-GAME HITTING 
STREAK. 
WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT ON OUR 
GRAPHIC.
HOW AWARE WERE YOU OF THAT 
HITTING STREAK? 
WHEN DID YOU BECOME AWARE OF IT?
>> I THINK ABOUT 30 GAMES PEOPLE
START MENTIONING IT.
BACK THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT 
OF TV OR PEOPLE FOLLOWING US. 
BUT IN ABOUT THE MIDDLE 30S TV 
AND THE PRINT MEDIA STARTED 
FOLLOWING IT A LITTLE BIT SO YOU
TOOK NOTICE.
WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE THAT
BIG A DEAL BUT IT TURNED OUT A 
LITTLE BIT OF A STORY WHEN WE 
GOT HEAR. 
>> THAT WAS OVER ONE SEASON?
YOU PLAYED THAT MANY GAMES? 
>> I THINK WE PLAYED ABOUT 72 
GAMES.
SO, I HAD IT GOING THROUGH 
PRETTY MUCH THE END OF THE 
SEASON. 
>> DID YOU FINISH THE SEASON 
WITH IT OR -- 
>> NO, IT ENDED HERE. 
MCMCDOWELL. 
THEN I HAD TO PLAY ON HIS TEAM. 
HE ENDED IT HERE. 
BUT IT WAS FUN. 
IT WAS A NEAT TIME AND IT WAS A 
FUN DEAL EVEN THOUGH IT ENDED 
HERE. 
IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR GUYS 
SHOWING UP THERE, EVEN NOW GUYS 
ARE HIGH DRAFT PICKS, IT MAY BE 
IT FOR OTHERS.
WHATS IT LIKE WONDERING IF YOU
CAN GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL?
>> EITHER WAY IT EXCITING.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE HERE AND 
YOUR GAME IS ON TV. 
ESPN HAS DONE A GREAT JOB.
THEY ARE THE BIG REASON THAT 
BASEBALL HAS BECOME SO BIG, 
COLLEGE BASEBALL. 
AND WHETHER YOU ARE GETTING 
DRAFTED OR JUST SHOWING UP TO 
PLAY YOU ARE EXCITED. 
HOPEFULLY YOU WIN.
BUT THE MAIN THING IS YOU ARE 
HERE AND YOU MADE IT TO THE LAST
EIGHT.
BUT IT IS EXCITING AS IF YOU ARE
PICKED IN THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS 
OR NOT DRAFTED. 
>> THERE ARE SO MANY PROSPECTS 
IF SOMEBODY SAID WHAT SHOULD I 
BE AWARE OF, WHAT IS THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVEN PRO 
BASEBALL, MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
AND COLLEGE BASEBALL? 
>> THIS IS THE LAST TIME IT IS 
FOR FUN AS FAR AS THE WAY YOU 
FELT WHEN YOU WERE A KID. 
ONCE YOU GET IN THE MAJOR 
LEAGUES EVERYBODY WANTS A JOB 
AND WANTS TO MOVE UP SO IT IS A 
LOT DIFFERENT.
IN BASEBALL GUYS HAVE THEIR 
POSITIONS AND THEY KIND OF 
INTERCHANGE A LITTLE BIT. 
GUYS PLAY MORE THAN TWO 
POSITIONS AND YOU ARE PLAYING 
FOR YOUR SCHOOL SO IT IS 
DIFFERENT.
ONCE YOU GET UP THERE IT IS MORE
CUTTHROAT AND WHOEVER PRODUCES 
KEEPS GOING.
>> YOU ARE A FORMER YANKEE AND 
ROGER CLEMENS IS COMING BACK. 
FOLLOWING THAT? 
>> YES, HE IS NOT DOING BAD IN 
THE MAJOR LEAGUES.
DOING WELL. 
I HOPE HE MAKES IT UP THERE.
>> I THINK THEY WILL CALL HIM UP
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT. 
>> REALLY?
I'M SHOCKED.
>> HE IS 43, HE WILL BE 44 THIS 
SUMMER. 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS 
LONGEVITY?
>> IT IS AMAZING. 
HE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS 
HOW TO DO THAT. 
OBVIOUSLY PREPARATION IS THE 
BIGGEST FACTOR FOR HIM. 
HE HAS ALL THE TALENT IN THE 
WORLD, BUT IF HIS HEART AND HEAD
WERE NOT IN IT HE COULDN'T DO IT
AND IT THERE. 
THAT WHY IT TOOK HIM SO LONG. 
>> THE ALL-STAR GAME WILL 
DETERMINE HOME FIELD IN THE 
WORLD SERIES AGAIN. 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? 
>> WELL, I THINK IT MAKES IT 
INTERESTING.
I WAS INVOLVED IN THE ONE THAT 
WAS A TIE AND IT RAISED A LOT OF
CONTROVERSY.
SO, IT IS NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING
ON THE LINE.
I THINK GUYS, YOU KNOW, GO IN 
THERE KNOWING THERE'S A PURPOSE 
AND I THINK THAT FANS WILL ENJOY
THAT THAT THEY KNOW SOMETHING IS
RIDING ON IT. 
>> DID YOU GO BACK TO WHEN IT 
MATTERED, WHEN -- I DON'T WANT 
TO SAY HATRED BUT WHEN THERE WAS
AN EDGE TO THE ALL-STAR GAME? 
>> WHEN I PLAYED? 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A 
HATRED BUT I KNOW 1992 IT WAS 
PRETTY IMPORTANT. 
I THINK TOM KELLY GAVE AS YOU 
SPEECH THAT WAS BEATING THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE AND THERE WERE 
SOME OLDER GUYS THAT IT 
MATTERED, THEY LEARNED FROM THE 
GUYS BEFORE AND GUYS CARE.
IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I
WASN'T AVAILABLE TO PITCH IN 
2002 SO THEY COULDN'T FINISH 
THAT GAME.
>> YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
AVAILABLE.
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN ON GOING 
INTO THE COLLEGE BASEBALL HALL 
OF FAME.
LUBBOCK, TEXAS. 
ARE YOU GOING?
>> YES, JULY 4TH. 
I WILL SEE IF WEEK BEAT THE HEAT

>> THE LONG SHOT, RIMS OUT, WADE
HAS IT. 
WADE WILL HOLD ON.
THE MIAMI HEAT ARE CHAMPIONS OF 
THE BASKETBALL WORLD! 
THEY HAVE WON THE NBA 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN FRANCHISE HISTORY!
>> ALONZO HAD A LOT OF 
INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY AFTER 
THE GAME. 
>> THE DARKEST TIME WAS IN 2000,
OCTOBER 3, 2000, MAKING THAT 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT I WOULDN'T BE 
PLAYING BASKETBALL AGAIN. 
THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE 
DARKEST MOMENTS.
I WAS ON SUCH A HIGH AT THAT 
POINT IN MY LIFE BECAUSE WE HAD 
JUST COME BACK FROM SYDNEY, 
AUSTRALIA AND WON A GOLD MEDAL 
AND TRAVELED BACK FOR THE BIRTH 
OF MY DAUGHTER. 
I WAS ON A HIGH AT THAT TIME. 
I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD.
AND IT ALL JUST WENT CRASHING 
DOWN WHEN I HEARD THAT NEWS.
GOING THROUGH -- I READ THIS 
BOOK A WHILE AGO AND THIS WAS A 
QUOTE FROM FREDERICK DOUGLAS 
SAYING THE ROAD TO SUCCESS HAS 
MANY OBSTACLES, AND YOU GO 
THROUGH ADVERSITY AND I HAVE 
GONE THROUGH MY SHARE OF IT 
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE. 
AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT GOING 
THROUGH THOSE THINGS, IT IS JUST
MAKING ME STRONGER, MADE ME MORE
DETERMINED TO NOT SUCCUMB BUT TO
OVERCOME AND I GIVE GOD ALL THE 
PRAISE, I TRULY DO, BECAUSE 
WITHOUT HIM JUST GIVING ME LIFE 
AGAIN, JUST GIVING ME AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE, AND JUST TO
EXPERIENCE THIS MOMENT, THIS 
PARTICULAR MOMENT HERE. 
I GOT MY COUSIN HERE AND HE'S 
THE ONE THAT DONATED THE KIDNEY 
TO ME.
AND I CAN'T -- WORDS CAN'T 
EXPLAIN HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO 
HIM.
I OWE MY LIFE TO HIM FOR JUST 
SAVING ME.
BECAUSE I REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, 
LYING IN THE HOSPITAL AND 
FEELING LIKE A NEWBORN BABY, 
TRULY HELPLESS, IN A LOT OF PAIN
AND HELPLESS AND JUST TO HAVE MY
STRENGTH AGAIN, YOU KNOW. 
AND A LONG TIME AGO I TOLD 
SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WOULD
TRADE EVERYTHING, ALL THE MONEY,
ALL THE MATERIAL THINGS, ALL THE
SUCCESS, I WOULD TRADE ALL OF 
THAT IN THE WORLD FOR MY HEALTH 
RIGHT NOW.
MY HEALTH IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME.
AND WITHOUT YOUR HEALTH YOU 
CAN'T LIVE A LIFE PRODUCTIVELY 
AND NOT JUST DO FOR YOURSELF BUT
DO FOR YOUR FAMILY. 
AND IT MAKES ME APPRECIATE 
LIVING EVERY MOMENT NOW EVEN 
MORE. 
AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH AS
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE 
I KNOW I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A 
SECOND CHANCE AND I KNOW THAT 
HAPPENED FOR A REASON.
AND THE ONLY WAY TO SHARE THAT 
PARTICULAR SITUATION IS TO 
CONTINUE TO TRY TO LIFT OTHER 
PEOPLE UP IN THE PROCESS, AND 
THOSE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH ANY 
TYPE OF ILLNESS, THOSE WHO, YOU 
KNOW, ARE GOING THROUGH 
TRANSPLANTATION AND HAVING TO 
DEAL WITH THOSE PHYSICAL 
OBSTACLES, YOU NEED SOME WORDS 
OF ENCOURAGEMENT, SOME HOPE.
I NEEDED THAT.
I GOT A CALL FROM LANCE 
ARMSTRONG.
HE TEXTED ME AFTER GAME FIVE AND
WE HAD AGAIN PLAYING PHONE TAG 
AND HE SPOKE TO MY MOM AND TOLD 
ME HAPPY FATHER'S DAY AND HE 
CALLED ME BEFORE THE SERIES 
STARTED, HE SAID THAT EVEN HIS 
HEART, EVEN THOUGH HIS HEART IS 
IN TEXAS HE WANTS TO SEE ME WIN.
AND A LOT OF YOU DON'T REALIZE 
THIS, BUT HE WAS A HUGE, HUGE 
INSPIRATION TO ME IN MY WHOLE 
RECOVERY PERIOD.
I READ BOTH OF HIS BOOKS AFTER 
MY SURGE, BOTH OF THEM. 
LYING IN THE HOSPITAL I WAS 
READING HIS SECOND BOOK.
AND THE FIRST BOOK WAS EXTREMELY
INSPIRING TO ME.
AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT HE HAD TO
GO THROUGH AND BEING ON HIS 
DEATH BED AND I SAID IF HE CAN 
DO IT, MAN, I CAN DO IT.
AND THE WAY I LOOKED AT HIM, I 
KNOW THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
OTHER PEOPLE THAT LOOK AT ME THE
SAME WAY AND I WANT TO BE HERE 
TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE HOPE TO
OVERCOME AND NOT SUCCUMB TO IT. 
BECAUSE ALL YOU NEED IS A LITTLE
HELP AND ENCOURAGEMENT. 
SOME PEOPLE NOT, MAY NOT SEE ME 
AS HUMAN BECAUSE OF THE THINGS I
TO ON THE COURT, I LAUGH, I CRY.
I'M AFFECTED BY SOME OF THE 
THINGS YOU MAY RIGHT WRITE OR 
SAY.
I'M HUMAN.
AND WHAT DRIVES ME IS MY FAITH 
AND MY FAITH IN KNOWING I'M 
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
AND I KNOW THAT -- AND I HAVE 
TOLD PLENTY OF PEOPLE THIS. 
THAT KIDNEY PATIENTS AND 
TRANSPLANT PATIENTS DEAL WITH 
ALL TYPES OF SICKNESSES AND 
ILLNESSES, I HAD GENTLEMAN 
APPROACH MAE YESTERDAY WHO WAS 
DEALING WITH PHYSICAL PROBLEMS 
TELLING ME HOW MUCH I'M AN 
INSPIRATION TO HIM AND I TOLD 
HIM PLAINLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE 
KEY TO YOU RECOVERING IS KEEPING
THIS RIGHT, KEEPING YOUR MIND 
RIGHT.
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THIS 
POSITIVE AND STRONG, THEN YOUR 
BODY IS GOING TO FOLLOW IT. 
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
I NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE, AND I 
THINK I CREDIT A GREAT DEAL OF 
MY RECOVERY TO THAT BECAUSE I 
NEVER GAVE UP UP HERE.
TO SO MANY PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO 
GIVE UP SAYING WHY ME NOT 
REALIZING IT A WHOLE LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE IT WORSE REGARDLESS 
OF HOW BAD YOU HAVE IT, 
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS. 
SO REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD YOU 
HAVE IT SOMEBODY HAS IT WORSE.
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAT.
THAT IS WHAT DRIVES ME. 
>> AMAZING STORY. 
ALONZO MOURNING, KIDNEY 
TRANSPLANT, COMES BACK TO PLAY, 
NOW PART OF THE NBA CHAMPIONS.>
REBOUND, WADE!
>> WADE HAS IT, HE HOLDS ON, AND
THE MIAMI HEAT ARE CHAMPIONS OF 
THE BASKETBALL WORLD! 
THEY HAVE WON THE NBA 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN FRANCHISE HISTORY! 
>> ANOTHER RING FOR RILEY AND 
SHAQ, THE FIRST FOR DWYANE WADE.
HEAT BACK IN MIAMI. 
PORTUGAL AND MEXICO ADVANCE IN 
THE WORLD CUP.
THE SEEDING IS OUT AT WIMBLEDON.
ROGER FEDERER AND AMELIE 
MAURESMO GETTING THE NUMBER ONE

[CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY 
ESPN, INC.] 
>> ALL BASEBALL THIS HALF HOUR. 
BRIAN KINNEY LIVE.
WE WILL TALK ONE-ON-ONE WITH 
GARY CARTER, THE MANAGER OF THE 
U.S. TEAM FOR THE FUTURES GAME 
AT THE ALL-STAR BREAK.
WE WILL TALK TO HIM, JUSTIN 
MORNEAU AND ADAM DUNN.
FIRST THE TOP STORIES OF THE 
DAY.
>> THE X.M. SATELLITE RADIO 
ALL-STAR FUTURES GAME.
THEY ARE ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE THE 
ROSTERS HERE IN A MOMENT. 
IT WILL BE ON ALL-STAR SUNDAY 
JULY 9. 
4:00 EASTERN TIME ON ESPN2. 
MANY OF THE TOP PLAYERS IN MAJOR
LEAGUE BASEBALL HAVE PLAYED IN 
THIS GAME.
MIGUEL CABRERA, LANCEERKMAN, 
MOST OF THE TOP PLAYERS OVER THE
LAST FEW YEARS. 
YOU WILL SEE THE STARS OF 
TOMORROW AGAIN ON JULY 9.
>> THE MANAGER FOR THE WORLD 
TEAM IS FERGUSON JENKINS, THE 
MANAGER FOR THE U.S. TEAM IS 
HALL OF FAME CATCHER GARY CARTER
HAD JOINS US NOW. 
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M DOING WONDERFUL, BRIAN.
A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU.
AND I'M JUST GETTING FIRST WIND 
OF MY TEAM AND I'M ACTUALLY 
EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT 
SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS SOME GOOD 
TALENT THERE AND I LOOK FORWARD 
TO THE CHALLENGE AGAINST 
FERGUSON JENKINS AND WE WILL GO 
INTO THIS WITH A WINNING 
ATTITUDEMENT 
>> A LOT OF THESE GUYS ARE MAJOR
LEAGUE READY. 
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM THIS 
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO GET A 
BRUSH WITH A LOT OF THESE 
ALL-STARS THAT WEEKEND? 
>> WELL, I THINK IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT.
AND IT GIVES THEM A TASTE OF 
PLAYING IN A BIG LEAGUE BALLPARK
LIKE THE ONE IN PITTSBURGH AND 
IT WILL BE FUN TO RUB SHOULDERS 
WITH THE LIKES OF THE COACHING 
STAFF AND SOME OF THE OTHER 
PLAYERS THAT WILL BE FILTERING 
IN DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY 
FROM OTHER GAMES THAT ARE 
TRANSPIRING THAT DAY FROM THE 
MAJOR LEAGUE SEASON.
SO, I THINK IT IS A BIG GAME FOR
THESE GUYS. 
IT GETS THEIR JUICES FLOWING, 
GETS THEM MORE EXCITED ABOUT 
WHAT IT IS LIKE TO PLAY AT THE 
BIG LEAGUE LEVEL. 
>> BESIDES GETTING IN SOME BUS 
RIDES WHAT DOES IT DO TO GET GET
INTO A HIGH PROFILE GAME? 
>> I THINK IT WILL LIFT THEIR 
SPIRITS.
WHEN YOU ARE CHOSEN FOR A GAME 
SUCH AS THIS STATURE I THINK IT 
IS PRETTY MUCH ENHANCING ONE'S 
CHANCES OF MAKING IT TO THE 
MAJOR LEAGUE LEVEL. 
THESE ARE TOP PROSPECTS.
THEY ARE NOT JUST PICKING 
ANYBODY.
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE CHOSEN FOR 
THIS GAME AND A BIG DEAL. 
AND I THINK THAT THE PLAYERS GO 
INTO IT THINKING THAT WAY.
YOU MENTIONED SOME PAST PLAYERS 
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME THAT 
HAVE REALLY EXCELLED AT THE 
MAJOR LEAGUE LEVEL. 
SO I THINK THESE KIDS WILL BE 
EXCITED.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE A GREAT 
GAME. 
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO JUST BEING
PART OF IT AND BEING ABLE TO 
MANAGE THEM.
>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF GUYS ALL 
THE TOP PLAYERS, MOST OF THE TOP
PLAYERS.
GARY, WHAT ABOUT YOU? 
YOU ARE IN THE FLORIDA STATE 
LEAGUE FOR THE METS.
YOU WANT TO MOVE UP, DON'T YOU? 
YOU ARE NOT JUST I'M A HALL OF 
FAMER.
YOU WANT TO MOVE UP, RIGHT? 
>> WELL, EXACTLY. 
I THINK THAT EVERYONE'S DESIRE 
ONCE YOU GET BACK IN THE 
COACHING RANKS AND LAST YEAR WAS
MY FIRST FULLIER GETTING BACK 
INTO IT AS A FULL-TIME 
COMMITMENT I WAS A ROVING 
CATCHING INSTRUCTOR FOR THE METS
FOUR YEARS PRIOR BUT I KIND OF 
HAD A GAME PLAN.
WHEN I RETIRED IN 1992 AS A 
PLAYER WITH THE EXPOS AND YEARS 
LATER HAD THE HONOR OF BEING 
INDUCTED INTO COOPERSTOWN, I 
WANTED TO BE THERE FOR MY FAMILY
AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF 
COACHING MY MIDDLE DAUGHTER IN 
HIGH SCHOOL, SAW HER PLAY AT 
FLORIDA STATE WHERE SHE EXCELLED
THERE.
I GOT THE CHANCE TO SEE MY 
ELDEST DAUGHTER PLAY TENNIS.
SHE WAS ON A SCHOLARSHIP AT 
STANFORD. 
I SAW MY SON INVOLVED IN SCHOOL 
PLAYS.
THEN FINALLY I GOT THE CHANCE, 
ONCE THE KIDS ARE BASICALLY OUT 
OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE 
YOUNGEST IS 21 -- I'M AGING 
MYSELF BUT I REALLY ENJOYED THE 
MANAGING PART OF IT LAST YEAR IF
THE GULF COAST LEAGUE.
THEN THE METS OFFERED ME THE 
DOUBLE-A JOB IN BINGHAMTON AND I
CHOSE THIS POSITION BECAUSE IT 
IS CLOSE TO HOME BEING THAT I 
STILL RESIDE IN PALM BEACH 
GARDENS IN FLORIDA. 
SO IT HAS BEEN A GREAT 
EXPERIENCE BUT ULTIMATELY, YES, 
I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE 
BIG LEAGUES AS A MANAGER AND 
HOPEFULLY LEAD A TEAM ONE DAY IT
A WORLD SERIES TITLE. 
>> GARY CARTER, NOT RESTING ON 
THE LAURELS.
NICE LAURELS BUT WHY REST.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU IN
PITTSBURGH. 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
>> THANKS.
AND SAME TO YOU.
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
LOVE LIMPING TO YOU AND 
OBVIOUSLY ON ESPN.
GOD BLESS YOU, TOO, MY FRIEND.
>> GARY CARTER. 
THAT IS JULY 9 4:00 EASTERN.

THE 10TH. 
>> THE TWINS HAVE WON EIGHT IN A
ROW.
SAW HIM THERE.
JUSTIN MORNEAU. 
BRIAN KINNEY HERE.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> PRETTY GOOD. 
>> YOU GUYS ARE DOING BETTER. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUTURES 
GAME. 
WE TALKED TO GARY CARTER. 
YOU PLAYED IN THAT GAME, RIGHT? 
>> I GOT TO PLAY TWICE. 
THE FIRST TIME WAS A LITTLE MORE
EXITING THAN THE SECOND TIME. 
IT WAS A GOOD TIME. 
>> YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO 
TWICE, ARE YOU? 
>> IT'S NOT ONE OF TSE THINGS 
THAT YOU KIND OF BRAG ABOUT.
IT IS A GOD EXPERIENCE. 
>> IT IS GREAT AND YOU ARE 
LOCKED IN NOW.
SO IT IS FINE.
BUT WHAT WAS THE GAME LIKE? 
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT IT?
>> THE FIRST ONE IN MILWAUKEE 
WAS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.
I THINK I WAS 1-3 AND FIRST TIME
PLAYING IN A BIG LEAGUE TAME YOU
ARE AROUND ALL THE OTHER 
PROSPECTS AND YOU SEE THE GUYS 
THEN YOU RUN INTO THEM LATER IN 
THE BIG LEAGUES AND YOU HAVE 
THAT THING IN COMMON AND YOU 
KNOW EACH OTHER AND IT IS PRETTY
FUN.
I GOT TO STAY FOR THE HOME RUN 
DERBY.
DIDN'T GET TO STAY FOR THE GAME 
BUT IT IS AN EXPERIENCE YOU 
NEVER FORGET. 
>> WHAT IS GOING RIGHT FOR YOU? 
THAT IS GREAT BY THE WAY. 
LOOKING AT THE PLAYERS THAT 
PLAYED WITH YOU IN THAT GAME. 
AN ALL-STAR GAME. 
GREAT TO GET OUT FOR THAT 
WEEKEND.
WHAT IS GOING RIGHT FOR YOU GUYS
NOW GIVEN THAT YOU STRUGGLED THE
FIRST TWO MONTHS? 
WHAT IS TURNING IT AROUND?
>> WE ARE GETTING HITTING AND 
PITCHING AT THE SAME TIME.
AT TIMES WE WOULD BE HITTING AND
NOT PITCHING OR WE WOULD BE 
PITCHING AND NOT SCORE. 
NOW WE'VE GOT SOME CONFIDENCE 
GOING AND IF WE ARE DOWN LATE WE
FEEL LIKE WE CAN COME BACK AND 
THE BULLPEN HAS BEEN GREAT AND 
THE STARTING PITCHING HAS BEEN 
GREAT AND WE ARE GETTING THE 
TIMELY HITS NOW AND WE ARE 
HAVING FUN PLAYING AGAIN. 
>> HOW DO YOU DO THAT 
INDIVIDUALLY? 
BECAUSE YOU ARE TEARING IT UP 
RIGHT NOW, YOU SLUMPED A I WILL 
EARLIER.
YOU MUST WRESTLE WITH THIS. 
HOW DO YOU KEEP IN THE ZONE?
>> WELL, YOU KIND OF FIND 
SOMETHING THAT FEELS GOOD AND 
TRY TO KEEP DOING IT. 
I GOT A LITTLE CONFIDENCE BACK 
WITH THE HOME STAND I FELT 
SOMETHING GOOD AND TRY TO DO 
THAT EVERY DAY AND IT HAS BEEN 
ROLLING SINCE THEN. 
YOU GET UP THERE AND GET A BIG 
HIT THE FIRST TIME AND THE NEXT 
TIME YOU DON'T. 
AS MUCH PRESSURE. 
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IS 
CONTAGIOUS. 
THE WHOLE LINE-UP HAS BEEN 
HITTING BETTER. 
IT JUST FUN TO COME TO THE PARK 
NOW.
>> WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU DID?
>> I WAS TRYING TO KEEP MY 
WEIGHT BACK A LITTLE BACK MORE. 
I WAS GETTING FOOLED ON 
OFF-SPEED STUFF AND EVERYTHING 
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS THE SAME 
SPEED AND MY HEAD WAS PROBABLY 
MOVING TOWARD THE BALL AND I 
TRIED TO STAY BACK AND STARTED 
HITTING HARD EVERYWHERE AND IT 
JUST KIND OF CLICKED THERE AND I
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THE SAME 
THING EVERY DAY SINCE.
>> YOU COME UP BEING SEEN AS THE
FUTURE ELITE POWER HITTER OF 
THIS ORGANIZATION.
WHAT IS IT LIKE DEALING WITH 
EXPECTATIONS LIKE THAT? 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, MOST 
POWER HIT, THEY DON'T REALLY 
THINK OF THEMSELVES AS POWER 
HITTERS.
JUST COMING UP I DIDN'T HIT TOO 
MANY HOME RUNS UNTIL I WAS AT 
TRIPLE-A. 
I WAS HITTING MORE FOR AVERAGE 
AND I HIT HOME RUNS MORE THE WAY
I LOOKED AT IT BUT DEFINITELY 
SOMETHING WE NEED IN MINNESOTA. 
I THINK WE HAVE NOT HAD 30 HOME 
RUNS SINCE 1987.
IT NOT BIG TO ME. 
IT NOT WHAT I PLAY FOR. 
I'M HERE TO HELP US GET BACK TO 
THE PLAYOFFS. 
BUT IT WILL BE NICE IN SOMEBODY 
DOES IT JUST SO WE CAN STOP A 
TALKING ABOUT IT. 
>> YOU AND JOE MAUER EXPECTED TO
BE THE HEART. 
HE IS HITTING .380. 
? 
>> HE IS AMAZE. 
I DON'T THINK HE HAS GONE 
HITLESS IN BACK-TO-BACK GAMES 
AND PROBABLY NOT SWUNG AT MORE 
THAN 0 OR 25 BALLS ALL SEASON.
HE WAITS FELL THEY THROW A 
STRIKE AND WHEN THEY DO IT SEEMS
LIKE HE GETS A HIT. 
IT IS FUN TO SEE A GUY THAT 
RELAXED, THAT YOUNG AND JUST 
NEVER SEEMS TO BE RATTLED, NEVER
SEEMS LIKE HE IS OFF BALANCE. 
HE IS ONE OF THE BEST HITTERS IN
THE LEAGUE. 
>> DO YOU LOOK AT OTHER GUYS' 
NUMBERS.
DO YOU SAY JOE, YOU ARE .381? 
>> YES, MORE EVERYBODY ELSE'S 
NUMBERS.
YOU DON'T REALLY LOOK AT YOUR 
OWN TOO MUCH. 
BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
YOU LOOK UP AND HE IS LEADING 
THE LEAGUE AND HE IS 23 AND THE 
SAME GUY THAT IF HE WAS HITTING 
.280. 
HE'S REAL COMPOSED AND JUST A 
GOOD TEAMMATE.
>> YOU GET ROGER CLEMENS 
TOMORROW NIGHT. 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? 
>> I HAVE NEVER FACED HIM 
BEFORE. 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
WE HAVE A GOOD PITCHER GOING FOR
US AND IT SHOULD BE A GOOD 
MATCH-UP. 
IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN TALK 
ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME.
HE IS DEFINITELY OF HALL OF 
FAMER AND IT IS ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS WE DON'T GET TO PLAY 
HOUSTON TOO MANY TIMES SO MAYBE 
MY ONLY CHANCE TO FACE HIM. 
>> WHEN HE MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT
HE WAS COMING BACK WE KNEW IT 
WOULD BE THE 22ND AGAINST THE 
TWINS.
DID YOU FOLLOW THAT?
WERE YOU AWARE IT WOULD COME 
AGAINST YOU?
>> YES, AS SOON AS IT WAS ON 
ESPN WE SAW THAT THEY KIND OF 
SCHEDULED IT THAT HE WOULD HAVE 
THREE MINOR LEAGUE STARTS AND 
THE FIRST START WAS AGAINST US 
AND EVERYONE GOT EXCITED, ONE OF
THOSE BIG GAMES, WILL BE SOLD 
OUT AND HE IS A BIG GAME PRIMP 
AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT 
REGULAR SEASON GAME BUT SHOULD 
HAVE A PLAYOFF KIND OF 
ATMOSPHERE. 
SHOULD BE A LOT OF FUN. 
>> DO YOU FACE YOUR OWN PITCHERS
EVER? 
IN B.P. OR ANYTHING?
DO YOU EVER FACE THEM IN LIVE 
B.P. OR ANYTHING? 
>> DURING SPRING TRAINING WE 
FACE THEM GETTING READY FOR THE 
GAMES AND THEY ARE GETTING THEIR
ARMS READY. 
THEY ARE BOTH NASTY AND AT HOME 
I USUALLY STAND IN ON THE 
PRISONS WHEN THEY WARM UP.
I'M GLAD THEY ARE ON MY TEAM. 
THEIR STUFF IS NASTY. 
THEY THROW HARD AND THEIR 
SLIDERS, BOTH SLIDERS ARE NASTY 
AND SANTANA'S CHANGE-UP, I'M 
GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO FACE HIM.
HOW GOOD DO YOU THINK LIRIANO 
IS? 
>> HE CAN BE AS GOOD AS SANTANA.
IF WE HAVE THEM IN THE ROTATION 
THEY ARE GOD. 
HE THROWS HARD. 
HE CAN GET UP TO 96 OR 97 BUT HE
HAS A NASTY SLIDER, CHANGE-UP.
IF HE CAN SPOT HIS STUFF UP A 
LITTLE MORE LIKE SANTANA HE CAN 
BE ONE OF THE BEST IN THE 
LEAGUE. 
>> BEFORE WE GO, WHAT DO YOU 
WANT IN YOUR CAREER?
YOU ARE ON THE PRECIPICE NOW, 
BECOMING AN ALL-STAR LEVEL 
PLAYER. 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO IN YOUR 
CAREER? 
>> I JUST WANT TO WIN A WORLD 
SERIES. 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WANT TO 
DO. 
ALL THE REST OF THE STUFF, 
PERFORM NUMBERS I DON'T LOOK AT 
IT TOO MUCH.
I WANT TO MAYBE THE ONLY THING I
WOULD LIKE TO BE KNOWN AS A 
PLAYER LIKE LARRY WALKER COMING 
FROM CANADA ONE OF THE BEST OUT 
OF CANADA BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE 
THINGS DOWN THE ROAD. 
FIRST I HAVE TO GET MY SECOND 
FULL YEAR IN THE BIG LEAGUE 
BEFORE I CAN WORRY ABOUT THAT.
IF I CAN BE COMPARED TO LARRY 
WALKER THAT WOULD BE A REAL 
COMPLIMENT. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, JUMP.
JUSTIN MORNEAU OF THE MINNESOTA 
TWINS.
WHEN WE COME BACK ONE LUCKY 
SLUGGER TO ANOTHER. 
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST.
THROUGH THICK AND THIN,
THIS TOWN SHOWED GRIT.
( crowd cheers )
IT TOOK 77 OF US

Crowd: OOH!
I REMEMBER STUMP MAHONEY,
ROWAND GUSPERSON,

JOE CLAW,
BOBBY BERNSTEIN.
THEN THERE WAS JIMMY HAAS.
INTRODUCING THE COORS LIGHT
COLD WRAP LABEL.
INSULATED TO HELP PROTECT
THE COLD FROM THE HEAT

'CAUSE SOMETIMES, BEER NEEDS

JOHN CLOXTON.
THERE WAS CLAYTON VOLF--
LET'S SEE, WHO ELSE?
>> HERE IS THE 2-2 DELIVERY, 
INTO RIGHT, THAT IS THE ONE, WAY
BACK, GOODBYE, HOME RUN, ADAM 
DUNN, REDS WIN. 
>> THAT WAS LAST WEDNESDAY, 11TH
INNING, TWO ON, NO SCORE, ONE OF
THE TOP SLUGGERS IN MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL TIED FOR FOURTH IN THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE IN HOME RUNS. 
ONE OF THE TOP 20 IN SLUGGING.
GET READY FOR THE METS TONIGHT. 
JOINS US LIVE ON THE HOT LIST.
BRIAN KINNEY HERE.
HOW ARE YOU, ADAM?
>> I'M GOOD.
>> WHAT WAS THAT LIKE AFTER 
NEARLY 11 SCORELESS INNINGS WHAT
IS IT LIKE TO END A GAME LIKE 
THAT? 
YOU DON'T GET PAID FOR EXTRA 
INNINGS.
GOOD THAT ONE SWING CAN END IT. 
>> YOU GOT BEAT UP THERE. 
IS THAT LIKE A THING WITH YOUR 
TEAM? 
>> YES, THEY TRY TO BE VIOLENT. 
I'M USUALLY THE PUNCHING BAG. 
PEOPLE LIKE SCOTT HATTEBERG FEEL
LIKE THEY HAVE TO PICK ON THE 
BIG GUY.
>> YOU ARE THE MONEY MAN. 
THEY CAN'T HURT YOU.
>> NO, THEY CAN'T.
BUT THEY TRY. 
>> THEY SHOULDN'T.
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR YOU TO 
STAY WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF
THE CARDS.
YOU GOT OFF TO A GOOD START.
>> IT IS HUGE.
WITH PUJOLS OUT WE FEEL LIKE WE 
CAN MAKE UP GROUND. 
BUT THEY ARE PLAYING WELL AND IT
SEEMS LIKE WE ARE PLAYING GOOD 
THEN WE WILL HIT A LITTLE FUNK. 
BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN WIN SOME 
GAMES AND MAKE UP GROUND. 
>> YOU ARE A PRETTY VERSATILE 
TEAM. 
YOU COULD MAY IN A COUPLE OF 
SPOTS.
RYAN FREEL BOUNCES AROUND.
KEN GRIFFEY COMES BACK. 
WHAT IS THE FEELING OF THIS TEAM
THIS YEAR?
WE ARE GETTING GREAT PITCHING 
AND WE KNOW WE ARE GOING TO 
SCORE SOME RUNS AND THE OFFENSE 
HASN'T BEEN CARRYING OUR PART OF
THE BARGAIN BUT IT IS A LONG 
SEASON AND THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME IN A LONG TIME WE FEEL LIKE
IF WE ARE IN IT OUR FRONT OFFICE
AND MANAGEMENT AND STUFF WILL 
GET THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED.
>> WHAT WENT INTO YOUR DECISION 
TO RE-SIGN? 
>> I LOVE IT. 
I LOVE IT HERE AND I THINK THAT 
WITH THE NEW OWNERSHIP AND 
PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE, ALL THEY DO
IS PREACH WINNING AND IT IS 
OBVIOUS JUST THE MOVES THEY MADE
, PICKING UP BROKEN VON AND BRAN
TON PHILLIPS AND DAVID RALSTON 
AND JUAN CASTRO.
THE MOVES HAVE BEEN ONES THAT 
HELPED US A BUNCH.
>> WALKS, STRIKEOUTS, HOME RUNS,
YOU GET A LOT OF THINGS.
DESCRIBE YOUR APPROACH TO 
BATTING.
>> I DON'T DO A LOT OF THINGS 
IMMODERATE. 
I STRIKE OUT A LOT, WALK A LOT 
AND HOPEFULLY HIT A LOT OF HOME 
RUNS. 
BUT I SWING HARD. 
>> DO YOU EVER THINK OF 
MODIFYING, I WONDER WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN IF I TRIED TO BE A 
BATTING AVERAGE GUY?
DO YOU EVER THINK OF CHANGING 
THE APPROACH?
>> I JUST TRY TO HIT THE BALL 
HARD AND WHEN I DO IT GOES OUT 
AND WHEN I DO I STRIKE OUT. 
SO, I GUESS YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE
GOOD WITH THE BAD.
>> DO YOU HAVE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHERE YOU EXPAND THE ZONE?
YOU HAVE R.B.I. SITUATIONS? 
DO YOU KEEP THE SAME ZONE AND 
SAY WE NEED MORE BASE RUNNERS OR
DO YOU SOMETIMES EXPAND?
>> THAT'S WHEN I GET IN TROUBLE 
EXPANDING THE STRIKE ZONE, 
TRYING TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH
RUNNERS IN SCORING POSITION AND 
OF GETTING A PITCH TO HIT.
I'M STILL LEARNING. 
I'M STILL FAIRLY YOUNG AND STILL
LEARNING THE GAME.
>> YOU MADE IN THE MLB FUTURES 
GAME IN 2001 WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED
THE ROSTERS.
WHAT WAS THAT GAME LIKE FOR YOU?
>> THAT WAS EXCITING. 
THAT WAS REALLY MY FIRST REAL 
EXPERIENCE OF AN ALL-STAR GAME 
AND THAT WAS FUN AND I WOULD 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO IT.
>> WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU GOT 
PULLED UP?
>> I WAS IN TRIPLE-A WHEN I GOT 
CALL UP -- 
>> BUT FOR THIS FUTURES GAME. 
>> I THINK I WAS IN DOUBLE-A. 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
>> IS THAT THE POINT THOUGH 
WHERE IT WAS STILL KIND OF A 
SHOCK TO GET UP TO PLAY IN A BIG
LEAGUE PARK ARE WERE YOU ON THE 
VERGE OF BEING CALLED UP ANY 
WAY?
>> I THINK I WAS -- MAYBE I GOT 
CALLED UP A WEEK AFTER THAT. BUT
IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN A 
BIG LEAGUE PARK AND IT WAS 
SAFECO AND THAT WAS A GREAT PARK
TO SEE. 
ONE OF THE NEWER ONES.
>> YOU GET TO MEET A LOT OF TOP 
GUYS. 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE GUYS THAT 
PLAYED ON YOUR TEAM AND AGAINST 
YOU?
>> YES, I REMEMBER SOME OF THEM.
I DON'T REMEMBER A LOT OF THEM 
BUT I REMEMBER A FEW OF THEM AND
WE STILL RUN IN EACH OTHER. 
>> THIS JUST CAME UP AGAIN, YOU 
WILL BE PART OF THIS MORE THAN 
LIKELY THE ALL-STAR GAME 
DETERMINES HOME FELD IN THE 
WORLD SERIES. 
THE OWNERS VOTED TO KEEP THAT 
GOING.
DO YOU LIKE THAT? 
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THAT 
SHOULD BE PART OF HOME FIELD 
ADVANTAGE.
WHO WINS THE EXHIBITION GAME. 
BUT WHATEVER THEY DECIDE IS FINE
WITH ME.
>> ADAM DUNN GETTING READY FOR 
THE METS. 
HE IS AT SHEA.
WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
GOOD TALKING WITH YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT, BRIAN.
THANKS. 
>> WHEN WE COME BACK THE TOP 
STORIES.
.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.

AND ELVIN HAYES HAS PICKED UP 
NUMBER 4. 
MOTTA IS SCREAMING. 
HE IS LUCKY HE DIDN'T GET A T.
>> JOHNSON GOES THE LENGTH, 
WEBSTER ON THE FOLLOW.
JACK SIKMA. 
JOHNSON.
KNOCKED AWAY. 
IT HAS BEEN CAUGHT AGAIN BY THE 
SONICS. 
AND THAT IS 39. 
WEBSTER HAS BROUGHT THE HOUSE 
ALIVE AND SEATTLE, BACK.
TRYING TO SLOW THINGS DOWN 
IMMEDIATELY WHICH HE DOES.
TRYING TO CALM DOWN THE SONICS. 
ATHENS THEY ARE AHEAD, THIS IS A
THUNDEROUS RESPONSE FWOURLTS. 
ELVIN HAYES.
HE QUIETS THE CROWD.
BIG, BIG BASKET.
>> THAT'S THE GREATEST WAY IN 
THE WORLD TO QUITE THEM DOWN IN 
THE ROAD. 
CHARLIE JOHNSON FOREARMED KNACK 
JACK THAT TIME. 
CALLED FOR THE FOUL.
THREE FOULS ON JOHNSON. 
>> MARVIN ASKING FOR IT.
BRINGING IT BACK TO YOUNG SIKMA.
SHORT.
WILLIAMS HUSTLES FOR THE BALL.
GOES AGAIN. 
AND THE LEAD IS AT 6. 
7:45 LEFT IN THE THIRD PERIOD OF
GAME 7. 
UNSELD LOBS FOR HAYES.
[WHISTLE] 
>> DANDRIDGE WAS COMING INTO THE
MIDDLE AND IT BE COUNTS.
AND WILKINS CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 
>> ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF MOVING THE
BALL TOLT WEAK SIDE, GIVING THE 
MAN AN OPPORTUNITIES OPPORTUNITY
TO GO 1-1.
16 POINTS FOR BOBBY D. WHO IS A 
FREE AGENT, PICKED UP BY THE 
BULLETS.
HE RESPECTED THEIR BIGGEST CASH 
OUTLAY IN PREPARATION FOR THIS 
SEASON. 
BOBBY HAD NOT PLAYED FOR VERY 
GOOD ON THE ROAD IN PLAYOFF 
COMPETITION BUT HE IS HAVING A 
GOOD GAME HERE. 
THIS IS WHEN YOU NEED HIM MOST. 
>> HAYES MISSING THE TURN 
AROUND. 
BACK ON DEFENSIVE.
JOHN JOHNSON FIRING THE BALL TO 
GUESS WILLIAMS. 
SHORT.
MARVIN WEBSTER COMING BACK AND 
AN ASSIST.
THAT IS HIS FOURTH PERSONAL FOUL
AND MELVIN HAYES. 
>> THE SHOT TAKEN, MARVIN 
WEBSTER UP FOR THE REBOUND, 
GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF ELVIN 
HAYES, RIGHT OVER HIS BACK. 
>> SO WE HAVE A TIMEOUT.
SONICS TRYING REGROUP AROUND 
LENNY WILKENS WITH WASHINGTON IN
COMMAND.
>> A HARD PLAY BY SIKMA THAT 
TIME. 
THAT'S HIS FIRST BASKET IN HIS 
LAST EIGHT ATTEMPTS ALSO. 
>> AND IT IS MUCH.
SECOND YEAR OUT OF NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
>> BUDDY BROWN TO THE ATTACK. 
STOLE BY DANDRIDGE. 
>> NOT A VERY GOOD SHOT IN THAT 
SITUATION.
SHOULD TRY TO WORK AROUND, RUN 
SOME KIND OF OVES, NOT GO 
ONE-ON-ONE AND TAKE A 20-FOOT 
JUMP SHOT.
>> HENDERSON TRYING TO COME 
AROUND THE CORNER THAT TIME.
GUS WILLIAMS HAS JUST PICKED UP 
FOUL NUMBER 5 AND DENNIS JOHNSON
QUICKLY CHECKS IN WITH GUESS 
GOING OUT.
>> AND GUESS, HIS LAST SCORE 
ATTEMPT IN THE GAME.
JOHNSON OVER 12 IN THE GAME.
SIKMA 1-8.
SO 3 OF THE 7 OR 10 THAT THEY 
HAVE ARE HAVING VERY POOR 
OFFENSIVE GAMES HERE IN EVENING.
>> COULDN'T HAVE A MORE 
INOPPORTUNITY TIME TO HAVE THAT 
HAPPEN. 
>> WE HAVE A 20-SECOND INJURY 
TIMEOUT.
IT WAS FOR TOMMY HENDERSON WHO 
SPRAINED HIS LEFT HAND SOMEWHAT.
THE WASHINGTON TRAINER TENDED TO
HIM AND TOMMY BACK AT THE 
FREE-THROW LINE, CHECKING THE 
CLOCK.
1:51 LEFT IN THE THIRD PERIOD.
A NINE-POINT BULLET LEAD. 
>> AND YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK 
THAT UNSELD IS SAYING TONIGHT IS
THE NIGHT.
HE HAS WAITED SO LONG FOR HAD A 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND HE IS ON THE 
BRINK.
>> LETTING SOME OF THE AIR THAT 
TIME, DRAUPPING THE FOUL. 
WATCHING INTENTLY TO SEE IF THE 
FIELD GOAL IS GOING DO GO DOWN 
AND UNSELD QUICKLY CHECKING THE 
CLOCK.
CALMLY HALF BLOWING A BUBBLE. 
>> TRYING TO GO AGAINST 
TREMENDOUS ODDS HAVING TO WIN 
TWO GAMES UP NEAR SEATTLE TO WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP. 
NOT MANY MEDIUM THOUGHT THEY 
COULD DO THAT BUT THEY ARE 
TRYING TO PROOF PEOPLE WRONG AND
THEY ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT 
SO FAR. 
>> THE BOSTON CELTICS WON THREE 
GAMES IN MILWAUKEE THE LAST TIME
THAT THE SERIES WENT SEVEN GAMES
AND THE LAST TIME THAT A ROAD 
TEAM WON THE DESIGHSIVE GAME. 
>> WHEN YOU GET TO THE LAST 
GAME, YOU DON'T THINK TOO MUCH 
ABOUT A HOME COURT ADVANTAGE. 
>> WEBSTER COMING BACK. 
SO IN THE 10 POINTS, THE BULLETS
LEAD. 
THEY COME DOWN WITH HENDERSON.
DANDRIDGE, WEST, CRISS-CROSSING 
HIS FORWARDS NOW. 
ROTATING UNDERNEATH.
UD OUTSIDE AND SHORT. 
MARVIN WEBSTER. 
KNOWING THAT HE IS GOING TO HAVE
TO CONTAIN WEBSTER DOWN THE 
STRETCH BECAUSE AS FREDDY BROWN 
SAID AT HALFTIME, THEY MUST GO 
INSIDE. 
DANDRIDGE FOR 3.
>> EXCELLENT DEFENSE BULLPEN THE
BULLETS HAVE THE RESPONSE.
>> THEY ARE REFUSING TO CRACK.
HOLDING UP UNDER TREMENDOUS 
PRESSURE AND ODDS.
>> DANDRIDGE FROM THE PAST AND 
IT'S HENDERSON WITH DENNIS 
JOHNSON COMING IN.
JOHNSON THE FOUL AND HENDERSON 
DOWN AND INJURED. 
>> FREDDIE IS OK PNGS HE WAS 
MORE UPSET ABOUT MISSING THE 
BASKET I BELIEVE THAN ANYTHING 
ELSE ON THIS PLAY.
DENNIS GRABBING UP TO MAKE SURE 
HE DOESN'T HURT HIM.
A GOOD SPORTSMAN LIKE GESTURE ON
HIS PART. 
A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT 
HE DIDN'T MAKE THE SHOT.
>> THAT'S HOW HE MAKES HIM FEEL 
EVEN WORSE. 
>> ANY TIME YOU MISS A 
FREE-THROW LINE -- FREE-THROW IN
A CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, IT REALLY 
HURTS, RICK.
>> IT HURTS ME TO MISS THEM ANY 
TIME. 
>> HE GOT POSITION. 
THAT IS 4-4.
PARTICIPANT GAME'S BIGGEST LEAD.
AT THE BUZZER.
JOHNSON PUTS ONE IN!
SO JOHNSON HAS HIT ONE FROM 
MID-COURT AS TIME RUNS OUT ON 
THE THIRD PERIOD. 
SO THEY HAVE HAD A RESPONSE FOR 
EVERYTHING. 
INCLUDING THE CLOCK RUNNING 
DOWN. 
THE WASHINGTON BULLETS ARE 12 
MINUTES AWAY FROM CAPTURING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP.
>> IT WAS THIS SHOT BY CHARLES 
JOHNSON THAT MADE IT 79-66. 
RICK FK NOT QUITE AS LONG OR 
DRAMATIC AS JERRY WEST AGAINST 
THE NEW YORK KNICKS, BUT THEY 
ARE DOING QUITE WELL, THANK YOU.
>> YES, IT DOES.
PUTTING THAT MUCH MORE PRESSURE 
ON THE SONICS WONDERING WHAT IS 
GOING ON OUT HERE?
WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANY BREAKS.
BUT THEY HAVE GOT 12 MINUTES TO 
WORK HARD, THEY HAVE THE CROWD 
BEHIND THEM.
>> 26 OFF THE BENCH AND THE 
BULLETS HAVE SUDDENLY COME UP 
WITH MORE DEPTH THAN THEY HAD 
WHEN THE SERIES BEGAN.
SHORT.
>> FREDDY BROWN.
WRIGHT WAS SCRAMBLING.
[WHISTLE] 
>> AND THE WHISTLE. 
BOBBY DANDRIDGE.
>> THEY SHOULD BE MOVING THE 
BALL AROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE.
THE BULLETS KEEPING THE PRESSURE
ON. 
THIS IS HOW THEY CAN WIN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP WITH THEIR DEFENSE.
>> THE BUMENTS SHOOTING SO MUCH 
BETTER DURING THE THIRD PERIOD. 
IT'S 12E. 
-- IT'S 11. 
>> STILL A LONG WAY TO GO.
THERE IS A TEN DENSEY TO LET UP 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU ARE AHEAD, 
BUT DON'T GO AWAY.
>> CHARLES JOHNSON. 
>> HAVE I SAID THAT MANY TIME 
BEFORE, JACK WILL PLAY THE SAME 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE SITUATION
IS. 
>> HE IS ALSO MOST VALUABLE 
PLAYER FOR MOST -- MOST VALUABLE
PLAYER FOR THE SERIES.
JACK SIKMA. 
>> INTO THE GOOD PASS.
AGAIN, TURNOVERS, THEY CAN CAN 
REBOUND SO COSTLY.
EVERY TRIP DOWN THE FLOOR FOR 
THE SONICS IS BIG.
SIKMA FACES UP. 
>> HE HAS HIT HIS LAST FIVE 
SHOTS.
JOHNSON IS IN THE CORNER. 
BALLARD GETS IT BACK AND JOHNSON
WITH THE SHOT CLOCK RUNNING OUT.
DOWN BY FREDDY BROWN. 
SONICS TRYING TO GET A RUNNING 
GAME GOING. 
BROWN, NOBODY IS ON DECK. 
81-74.
WE WILL HAVE A TIME OUT CALLED 
BY DICK MOTTA.
>> HE KNOWS THAT THE PASS, THAT 
MOVE AND TRYING TO HOLD THE 
SONICS OFF. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE DONE SO 
FAR, ALL GAME LONG.

OVER THE BACK LAST TIME.
WE WILL HAVE TO CHECK THE REPLAY

OBJECT THAT REPLAY. 
KEY IT UP AGAIN.
>> HERE IT COMES RIGHT NOW. 
HERE IS THE SHOT. 
JACK SIKMA AT THE BOTTOM PART OF
THE SCREEN. 
JUMPS RIGHT INTO ELVIN HAYES. 
SHOULD HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY. 
>> HAYES MAY HAVE COME DOWN ON 
HIM WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AND THAT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE REASON WHY 
THE FOUL WAS CALLED ON E.R. E.
AT ANY RATE, IT WAS CLOSE, IT 
WAS AGAINST HAYES AND 6 FOULS 
FOR HAYES.
DANDRIDGE WILL TAKE THAT. 
>> OFFENSIVE FOUL.
AND IT'S THE SONICS EAGS TURN TO
COMPLAIN.

DENNIS JOHNSON OUT ON HENDERSON 
WHO PUT HIS HEAD DOWN, AND THE

VITAL.

HAND, LOOSE BALL. 
PICKING UP AND STAYS LOOSE. 
CAME UP WITH A BASKET AND PUT AN
END, THE HE LAYS LOOSE ON THE 
FLOOR AND SEIZING THE 
OPPORTUNITY WITH HENDERSON DOWN 
AND KUPCHAK OVER TO ASSIST HIM. 
>> HE WAS THE MAN THAT PUT HIS 
BODY ON THE LINE, BOUNCED TO 
KUPCHAK AND YOU CAN SEE THE 
REACTION. 
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT, THE 
BEST THING JUST DIVE ON TOP OF 
THAT BALL AND SMOTHER IT. 
>> DICK MOTTA WITH TOM THOMSON 
DOWN. 
12 POINTS FOR KUPCHAK.
HE IS 5-6 WITH FIVE REBOUNDS. 
AND HE MADE IT 100-94.
>> TO SECOND-GUESS YOURSELF.
HENDERSON DID A GREAT JOB OF 
JUST KEEPING THE BALL ALIVE.
>> THE SONICS, JOHN, IT H. EVERY
OPPORTUNITY TO COME OUT OF THERE
WITH THE BASKETBALL AND THEY 
COULDN'T HANDLE IT. 
>> THEY PLAYED GOOD DEFENSIVE.
CHARLIE JOHNSON HAD TO TAKE A 
20, 25-FOOTER.
>> HERE AGAIN, WEBSTER HAD A 
PIECE OF BALL WITH THE ACTIVE 
HAND AND REALLY GETS IT WELL. 
>> THEY WILL SEE WHAT THEY CAN 
DO WITH THE LAST ONE ONE MINUTE 
AND 30 SECONDS AND THE BULLETS 
LEADING BY 6 POINTS.

>> FREDDY BROWN, COMING UP AND A
FOUL CALLED ON HIS SHOT ATTEMPT.
BOBBY DANDRIDGE.
>> FREDDY BROWN REALLY LOOKING 
TO THE OFFENSIVE. 
THIS IS HIS GAME RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE IS 
ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE THAT 
THINKS HE CAN DO THAT.
THIS TIME HE PICKED UP A FOUL IN
THE PROCESS.
HE HAS A CHANCE TO COMPLETE TWO 
SHOTS HERE AND CUT THE LEAD 
AGAIN.
>> FOUR FOULS ON BOBBY D. 
FREDDY BROWN HAS EXPERIENCE 
AMONG USUALLY PROBLEMS FOR HIM 
AT THE FREE-THROW LINE OF THIS 
SERIES. 
>> 5U9 AND THE BULLETS WITH THE 
BALL. 
>> THEY WANT TO USE UP AS MUCH 
TIME AS POSSIBLE. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BRING THE 
CLOCK DOWN AS FAR AS THEY CAN.
>> KUPCHAK REJECTED, WEBSTER AND
C.J. IS OFF.
IT WILL GO TO THE SONICS. 
[WHISTLE] 
>> 
>> 101-95, I WOULD THINK JOHN 
HAVLICKEK, JUST AS YOU POINTED 
OUT, THEY WILL GO TO FREDDY 
BROWN AND DICK MOTTA WILL 
INSTRUCT THE BULLETS TO BE READY
FOR THAT. 
>> YOU CAN BE SURE HE WILL GET A
FEW PICKS ON THIS SEQUENCE. 
HERE AGAIN, BULLETS NOT ELECTING
TO PUT PRESSURE PRER ON THE MAN 
OUT OF BOUNDS.
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS TURN AND 
FACE IT, HE HAS A LOT OF TIME TO
PICK OUT THE MAN. 
THIS IS A CRUCIAL SITUATION, PUT
A MAN ON THE PERSON TAKING THE 
BALL OUT OF BOUNDS. 
IT IS REALLY UNDER A LOT OF 
HEAVY PRESSURE TO MAKE THE 
ATTACK. 
>> BROWN COMES OUT TO MEET HIM. 
>> THEY CANNOT WASTE TIME.
KUPCHAK GOES DOWN IN AN EFFORT 
TO DRAW THE FOUL. 
AND 101-97. 
>> HE HAS THAT UNCANNY ABILITY 
TO THE GET PEOPLE IN THE AIR, 
AND GET BETWEEN THEM. 
GOOD SHOT.
HE CAN SHOOT IT OFFBALANCE. 
>> AHEAD BY 4, THE NBA 
CHAMPIONSHIP AT STAKE HERE. 
>> DANDRIDGE, MARVIN WEBSTER -- 
WEBSTER, HELPING OUT WITH THE 
PRESSURE. 
DANDRIDGE BRINGS IT UP, ACROSS 
THE TIME LINE.
USING THE CLOCK, GOING TO 
HENDERSON.
SHOT CLOCK DOWN TO 10.
[WHISTLE] 
>> SONICS FINALLY GO FOR THE 
FOUL. 
JACK SIKMA IN THE CORNER. 
>> IN THE CORNER, AWAY FROM THE 
BALL. 
WE WILL SEE HOW THE GAMBLE PAYS 
OFF.
>> SO THERE INDEED IS THE 
TIMEOUT.
26-SECONDS. 
SONICS DOWN BY FOUR POINTS. 
AND OF COURSE AS SOON AS THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP IS DETERMINED, WE 
WILL TAKE YOU INSIDE THE WINNING
LOCKER ROOM AND HAVE THE 
PRESENTATION OF THE TROPHY.
[WHISTLE] 
>> SO IT HAS COME DOWN TO THE 
LAST 26 SECONDS, OF GAME 7. 
ITSELF SEATTLE SUPERSONICS 
TRAILING ITSELF WASHINGTON 
BULLETS 101-97. 
>> I'M SURE YOU WILL SEE THEM 
GOING TO FREDDY BROWN AGAIN AND 
WHEN THE SHOT IS TAKEN, THERE 
WILL BE FIVE SPEEM CRASHING THE 
BOARDS. 
[WHISTLE] 
>> IT BEGINS. 
FREDDY BROWN. 
IN AND OUT! 
AND THE REBOUND BACK UP AND IN 
BY PAUL SILAS WITH 18 SECONDS.
IT'S A 2-POINT LEAD.
PRESSURE NOW, UNSELD GOES TO 
HENDERSON 
[WHISTLE] 
>> WILKINS SAYING NO FOUL BUT 
UNSELD WAS PICKED UP IN THE BACK
COURT.
PAUL SILAS. 
LENNY HAD CHECK THE CLOCK AND HE
PREFERRED TO WAIT UNTIL THEY 
CAME ACROSS THE LINE. 
BUT SILAS WAS OVER TO UNSELD. 
UNSELD, 0-2, HIS LAST TIME TO 
THE FOUL LINE.
>> HE WILL BE SHOOTING 3-2 
BECAUSE THE FOUL WAS IN THE BACK
COURT.
>> THE LAST FREE-THROW. 
>> MAKING UP A MIGHTY IMPORTANT 
ONE.
IT'S A 3-POINT LEAD.
>> THE SONICS HAVE ONE TIME OUT 
LEFT, I BELIEVE AND THEY ARE 
GOING TO USE THAT AS SOON AS 
THIS PLAY IS COMPLETED. 
>> SO IT IS 102-99, AND THE 
TENSION BEGINS TO BUILD IN THE 
COLISEUM AS TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
ON THE SUPERSONICS. 
>> WES UNSELD WILL BE COMING TO 
THE FREE-THROW LINE TO SHOOT HAD
THE PENALTY.
>> THIS MAY VERY WELL BE THE 
BIGGEST FREE-THROW LINE WES HAS 
EVER SHOT.
>> 
>> MAKING IT A FOUR-POINT BULLET
LEAD. 
LEADING WITH THE RIGHT FOOT, 
CALMING COMING BACK AFTER 
MISSING THREE IN A ROW AND 
HITTING THOSE TWO IMPORTANT 
ONES. 
WHICH PUT THE BULLETS UP BY 4 
AND 12 SECONDS TO GO. 
SO, WES UNSELD, WHO IN 1971 
FAILED AS THE SUPER OF THE 
BALTIMORE BULLETS WHEN THEY WERE
BLOWN OUT BY KAREEM IN THE 
MILWAUKEE BUCKS FOUR STRAIGHT 
GAMES, AND WHO FAILED AGAIN IN 
1975 WHEN THE GOLDEN STATE 
WARRIORS BEAT THE WALKER BULLETS
BY FOUR STRAIGHT IS JUST 12 
TICKS OF THE CLOCK AWAY FROM HIS
FIRST NBA CHAMPIONSHIP. 
AND FOR DICK MOTTA, IT ALL BEGAN
BACK IN UTAH, MOVED TO GRACE 
IDAHO WHERE HE FAILED TO MAKE 
HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEAM. 
WENT IN THE AIR FORCE AND GAME 
BACK AS COACH.
MOVED UP TO VARSITY AND A STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
FLAHERTY BECAME APPEAR 
SUCCESSFUL HEAD COACH PAT WEAVE 
REMEMBER STATE AND FROM THERE, A
MAN BY THE NAME OF DICK KLINE 
GAVE HIM HIS OPPORTUNITY TO 
BECOME HEAD COACH OF THE CHICAGO
BULLS.
FOUR TIMES HE LED THE BULLS TO 
50-PLUS VICTORIES, ONE TIME 
GOING TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 
OF THE WESTERN CONFERENCE.
AND NOW, AS HEAD COACH OF THE 
WASHINGTON BULLETS, DICK MOTTA 
IS ABOUT TO TURN TO THAT FAMOUS 
FRONT LADY OF HIS AND SAY OK, 
LIGHT IT UP, WE HAVE GOT IT 
DONE. 
BUT 12 SECONDS AND A LOT OF 
STRANGE THINGS CAN HAPPEN IN THE
NBA.
HEAR IS THE MAN, LENNY WILKENS, 
CAME OUT TO BE THE NUMBER 1 
CONTRAST CHOICE OF THE ST. LOUIS
HAWKS IN 1960.
TRADED FROM ATLANTA TO SEATTLE 
AND BECAME A PLAYER-COACH OF 
THESE SUPERSONICS.
LATER TRADED AWAY TO CLEVELAND. 
LONGED TO BECOME THE HEAD COACH 
OF THE PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS AND
HAD ONLY ONE MISFORTUNE TUNE. 
HE COULDN'T PROSECUTE KEEP BILL 
WALTON HEALTHY. 
HE HAS COME TO SEATTLE 
SUPERSONICS THIS YEAR, HE TOO, 
12 SECONDS AWAY BUT FOR LENNY 
WILKENS, IT'S A LONGER 12 
SECONDS.
BALL SILAS WILL TAKE THE BALL 
OUT OF THE BOUNDS.
IT'S BEEN A WHALE OF A CAMPAIGN.
IT IS IN AND OUT. 
WITH THE CALL.
IT IS ABOUT TO END. 
BOBBY DANDRIDGE.
HE WILL BE OUR MOST VALUABLE 
PLAYER. 
VOTED AS MOST VALUABLE PLAYER 
HERE, THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 
SERIES FANTASY CELEBRATIONS 
BEGIN IN WASHINGTON.
THE WASHINGTON BULLETS FILE OFF 
THE FLOOR AND THE CROWD HERE IN 
SEATTLE, COMES TO ITS FEET AND 
GIVES BOTH THE TEAMS A 
TREMENDOUS OVATION. 
>> FREDDY BROWN AND UNITED 
STATES -- UNSELD SHAKING HANDS 
AT MID-COURT. 
THEY DIDN'T THINK THE THEME 
WOULD GET INTO THE PLAYOFFS.
AND FOR THE WASHINGTON BULLETS, 
THEY HAVE FINALLY DONE IT AND 
DONE IT THE HARD WAY. 
THEY TWICE HAD TO WIN GAMES HERE
IN SEATTLE, ONE IN THE KING DOME
BEFORE 39,000 FANS AND HERE 
TONIGHT IN THE SEATTLE CENTER 
COLISEUM WHERE THE SUPERSPONICS 
HAD WON 42 STRAIGHT GAMES.
AND THE WASHINGTON BUMENTS, 
105-99, THE FINAL SCORE AS THEY 
FILE INTO THEIR LOCKER ROOM.
THE HAPPY CHAMPIONS OF THE NBA. 
AND THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER 
BOBBY DANDRIDGE.
THE ROOKIE AS THEY ELIMINATED 
ATLANTA.
[INAUDIBLE] 
[INAUDIBLE] 
[INAUDIBLE]

HOME COURT BUT THEY TAKE IT AWAY
TONIGHT AS THEY HAVE WON THE NBA
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
.

YOU WERE VOTED MMPLE V.P. 
BOBBY, YOU PLAYED A FINE 
ALL-AROUND SERIES.
THAT'S THE ONE THING WE 
REMARKED ABOUT, YOU PLAY BOTH 
ENDS OF THE FLOOR.
>> I'VE ENJOYED THIS SEASON AS 
MUCH AS I'VE ENJOYED ANY SEASON 
IN MY LIFE. 
I HOPE THIS IS JUST THE 
BEGINNING OF A GREAT CAREER IN 
WASHINGTON. 
>> ALL RIGHT, BOBBY, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH.
LET'S GET SOMEBODY ELSE.
GREG. 
A YOUNG MAN HERE WHO WE TALKED 
A LOT ABOUT.
ANOTHER GOOD JOB OUT HERE, 
YOU'VE GOT A FINE FUTURE, HOW 
DOES IT FEEL TO BE ON A 
CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM IN YOUR FIRST 
YEAR. 
>> IT FEELS GREAT.
I'M PROUD.
I'M DEFINITELY PROUD OF THE 
VETERANS, THEY DID ONE HECK OF 
A JOB THROUGHOUT THE SERIES, 
STARTING WITH ATLANTA AND SAN 
ANTONIO, PHILADELPHIA, AND NOW 
THE SEATTLE SUPERSONIC, THEY 
WERE TOUGH. 
GIVE ALL THE CREDIT TO THE 
SONICS, THEY ARE ONE TOUGH 
TEAM. 
>> THANKS A LOT, SUPER JOB. 
WE'LL TRY TO GET MORE PLAYERS 
IN HERE AS WE CAN.
THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE WE WANT TO 
TALK TO, WES UNSELD, MITCH 
KUPCHAK, ONLY OVER HERE.
ANOTHER YOUNG MAN PLAYING ONLY 
THE SECOND YEAR IN THE NBA, 
YOU'VE BEEN ON GOOD BALL CLUBS 
IN COLLEGE, HOW DOES IT FEEL 
HERE? 
>> IN COLLEGE WE JUST COULDN'T 
WIN THE FINALS, BUT THIS IS 
GREAT.
EVERYBODY DID A GREAT JOB.
BETWEEN MONTREAL AND COLLEGE, 
THIS TAKES IT.
>> I THINK YOU'RE DOWNGRADINGOR 
PERFORMNESS IN THE KING DOME, I 
THINK YOU SINGLE HANDEDLY 
CARRIED THEM ALONG AND SAID, 
FELLOWS, WE CAN WIN THIS. 
>> IT'S NICE TO HEAR SOMETHING 
LUKE THAT, BUT IT'S A TEAM 
EFFORT. 
IT'S CLICHE, BUT IT'S GREAT.
IT'S BEEN A LONG SEASON, BUT WE 
ALL DID IT TOGETHER.
>> YOU HAD A RING, I GOT THE 
RING, THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL 
ABOUT.
IT'S A TREMENDOUS FEELING TO 
WIN ALL OF THIS TIME, ALL THESE 
GAMES, ALL OF THESE YEAR, THIS 
IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. 
>> I SYMPATHIZE.
THE BIGGEST GAME OF YOUR 
CAREER, YOU HAD TO SIT ON THE 
BENCH.
I THINK YOU HANDLED IT WELL.
>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF FOULS IS 
BAD, BUT EITHER YOU SEE THE 
GUYS GO OUT THERE AND GO GET IT 
LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S 
NOTHING YOU CAN DO WHILE YOU'RE 
ON THE BENCH, BUT TO GET IT AND 
KNOW YOU HAVE IT AND THEY CAN'T 
TAKE IT NOW.
>> GREAT GOING AND CONTINUED 
SUCCESS TO YOU. 
LET'S GO TO THE TROWTROW IF I 
PRESENTATION. 
>> THE COMMISSIONER OF THE NBA, 
LAURENCE O'BRYAN IS HERE WITH 
SPECIAL GUESTS AND 
COMMISSIONERING WHY DON'T YOU 
PRESENT THE TROPHY. 
>> I WILL.
FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THAT WE 
SHOULD COMMEND THE SEATTLE 
SUPERSONICS FOR A GREAT SERIES 
ALSO. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT SERIES 
OF ALL TIME IN THE NBA. 
AND IT WAS PLAYED RIGHT DOWN TO 
THE WIRE. 
WE COULD ALL BE PROUD OF THE 
SUPERSONICS OF COURSE TONIGHT.

>> BULLS WIN! 
THEY WIN IT!
>> HELLO, I'M ANDRE ALDRIDGE, 
WELCOME TO NBA TV HARDWOOD 
CLASSICS. 
AFTER A LONG AND GLORIOUS RUN, 
IT SEEMED 1969 MIGHT BRING THE 
FALL OF THE CELTIC DYNASTY. 
WEAKENED BY AGE AND INJURY, 
BOST FINISHED FOURTH IN THE 
EAST IN THE REGULAR SEASON, BUT 
RALLIED IN THE PLAYOFFS TO MAKE 
IT BACK TO THE NBA FINALS.
THEY WERE HEAVY UNDERDOGS WITH 
A POWERFUL L.A. LAKER TEAM WITH 
ELGIN BAYLOR AND MAGIC JOHNSON. 
THE TEAMS BATTLED THROUGH SIX 
GAMES, AND TODAY WE BRING YOU 
THE FORTH QUARTER OF THE SIXTH 
GAME. 
>> 91-76, THE LARGEST LEAD HELD 
BY THE CELTICS IN THIS GAME.
>> THE INTERESTING THING TO ME, 
WE SEE HOPKINS GET THE TIP AND 
DRIVE DOWN, THEY'RE VERY FRESH. 
WE'RE GOING INTO THE FOURTH 
PERIOD, THE LAKERS ARE STANDING 
AROUND MORE AND SEEM TO BE MORE 
TIRED THAN THE CELTICS. 
>> AM JONES, 35 YEARS OLD, 
PLAYING LIKE A 25-YEAR-OLD. 
>> HE'S GOT THE HOT HAND, 
THAT'S TROUBLE FOR THE LAKERS.
LAKERS ONLY HIT 28% IN THAT 
THIRD QUARTER.
I THINK IT'S DUE TO THE ALERT 
DEFENSE OF THE BOSTON CELTICS.
>> JONES, WHO HAD 24 POINTS, 
HAS WRESTLED, TRIED TO SAY THAT 
THE IN LINE, JOHN EGAN CALLED 
FOR THE THREE PLAY. 
>> WE'VE SEEN THE DEPTH OF THE 
CELTICS, LAKERS CAME OUT IN THE 
SHUTOUT, DONN NELSON, HAVLICEK, 
WHEN YOU SHUT OUT JERRY WEST 
AND ELGIN BAYLOR, SELDOM DO YOU 
SEE THE OTHER THREE PICK UP THE 
SCORING SLACK.
[WHISTLE] 
>> HAWKINS. 
A WILD HOOK SHOT. 
LET'S SEE IF SAM JONES -- IT 
IS. 
JONES NOW WITH FIVE PERSONALS.
SAM JONES WITH FIVE.
SIEGFRIED WILL REPLACE JONES. 
YOU LOOK AT WILT CHAMBERLAIN 
WITH FIVE FOULS.
>> SAM'S FOULS NOT NEARLY AS 
CRITICAL AS WILT CHAMBERLAIN'S 
FIFTH FOUL. 
[WHISTLE] 
>> FOULED FROM BEHIND.
THREE ON EGAN.
IF YOU JUST JOINED US, BOSTON 
LED AT THE END OF THE FIRST, 
28-25.
AT HALFTIME, 59-56. 
AT THE END OF THE THIRD 
QUARTER, 91-76. 
NOW IT'S 94-78, 18 POINTS FOR 
BRYANT. 
>> THE CELTICS WITH THAT BIG 
LEAD, OFTENTIMES THE INTENT IS 
TO BLOW IT UP, SIT ON THE LEAD, 
WORK THE 24-SECOND CLOCK WITH 
THE GOOD SHOT.
THEY DIDN'T GET THAT LEAD BY 
HOLDING IT UP.
ELGIN BAYLOR DRIVING ACROSS THE 
MIDDLE. 
>> 94-80. 
WHISTLE.
SIX POINTS FOR BILL.
>> BILL RUSSELL, AGE 35, 
PLAYING IN HIS 101ST GAME THIS 
YEAR, CHRIS.
[WHISTLE] 
>> AND NOW BILL RUSSELL HAS 
FIVE PERSONALS. 
SAM JONES WITH FIVE, BILL 
RUSSELL WITH FIVE.
FOR THE LAKERS, WILT 
CHAMBERLAIN WITH FIVE.
MEL COUNTS WITH FOUR. 
WEST TO THE LINE, LOOKING FOR 
HIS 28TH POINT. 
THE FOUL LINE, LAKERS HAVE HIT 
ON 18-34. 
>> CHRIS IN A SITUATION LIKE 
THIS, WILT CHAMBERLAIN IS MORE 
PO TENT OFFENSIVELY AND MORE, I 
THINK BETTER ABLE TO GET THE 
SIXTH PERSONAL FOUL ON BILL 
RUSSELL THAN BILL IS ABLE TO 
GET THE SIXTH FOUL ON WILT 
CHAMBERLAIN.
>> HOWE INTO THE BOSTON LINEUP. 
98-81.
WILT CHAMBERLAIN DRIVING ON 
RUSSELL.
YOU MAY SEE A LOT OF THAT NOW.
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
THE LAKERS NOW WILL BE GOING TO 
WILT CHAMBERLAIN AND WILT WILL 
BE TRYING TO FOUL BILL OUT. 
GONE TO BILL'S OUTSIDE, THEY 
HAVE THAT HOT HAND. 
>> BRYANT, 18 POINTS. 
[WHISTLE] 
>> AND INTO THE LOS ANGELES 
LINEUP, REPLACING JOHNNY EGAN, 
ERICSON.
THE LOS ANGELES LINEUP HAS TOM 
HAWKINS, JERRY WEST, ERICSON, 
ELGIN BAYLOR, AND WILT 
CHAMBERLAIN.
FOR BOSTON, HAVLICEK PUTS THE 
BALL IN, RUSSELL, SIGH FREED, 
AND HOWE. 
CHAMBERLAIN WITH THE REBOUND. 
>> CHAMBERLAIN NOT EVEN 
GUARDING RUSSELL. 
I EXPECT WE'LL SEE THE SAME AT 
THE OTHER END.
BILL RUSSELL COMPLETELY OFF 
CHAMBERLAIN.
>> LOS ANGELES TRAILING BY THE 
LARGEST MARGIN, 17. 
CHAMBERLAIN GETS THE REBOUND. 
20 REBOUNDS FOR WILT. 
BAYLOR. 
>> YOU KNOW, THE LAKERS ARE 
THROWING IT UP THERE, THEY HAVE 
TO MAKE UP 17 POINTS AND 
THEY'VE GOT TO GET THAT BALL 
DOWN QUICKALISM THEY'RE 
THROWING THE BALL UP, PLAYING 
IN THE FOURTH PERIOD AS THEY 
WERE IN THE FIRST PERIOD. 
>> THERE YOU SEE THE LIST OF 
PLAYERS, JONES, RUSSELL, 
CHAMBERLAIN, WITH FIVE PERSONAL 
FOULS, A LOT OF TIME LEFT, 8:52 
REMAINING IN THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
FINALS. 
ELGIN BAYLOR FOR LOS ANGELES. 
JERRY WEST. 
[WHISTLE] 
>> AND LARRY SIEGFRIED FOULS 
HIM IN THE ACT OF SHOOTING. 
THE SECOND ON LARRY.
>> LOS ANGELES, THE WESTERN 
DIVISION CHAMPIONS WITH 55 
VICTORIES DURING THE SEASON, 
BOSTON FINISHING FOURTH WITH 48 
IN THE EAST.
WEST WITH 30 POINTS.
>> 15 POINTS, AN AWFUL LOT OF 
POINTS TO OVERCOME WITH 8:28 
LEFT IN THE BALLGAME. 
THE CELTICS ARE SLOWING THE 
BALL DOWN TO EAT UP THE CLOCK.
THAT MAY GIVE LOS ANGELES AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME QUICK 
BASKETS.
THERE YOU SEE THEM SLOWSING IT 
UP. 
THEIR GAME IS TO RUN. 
>> BRYANT GUARDED BY KEITH 
ERICSON.
KNOCKED OUT BY KEITH. 
SIEGFRIED WAITING OVER HERE IN 
THE MIDDLE AS HAVLICEK GETS TO 
HIM.

PERHAPS HE DOESN'T WANT TO LET 
THE LAKERS GET LIFE AND SAM IN 
THAT BACKCOURT WILL KEEP THE 
LAKERS' DEFENSE HONEST 
DEFENSIVELY.
>> NOW ELGIN BAYLOR HAS FOUR 
PERSONALS.
>> I IMAGINE BILL RUZZ EL IN 
CALLING THAT TIME-OUT DISCUSSED 
WEST QUITE A BIT. 
WEST IS THE ONE THE LAKERS WILL 
GO TO TO TRY TO BRING THEM 
BACK. 
WE CAN EXPECT THE CELTICS TO 
TRY TO DOUBLE-TEAM WEST TO TRY 
TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTING THE 
HOT HAND HERE.

RUSSELL WITH THE REBOUND.

>> CHAMBERLAIN CAN'T MOVE.
HE'S DOWN THERE HOLDING THAT 
KNEE. 
HE REALLY TWISTED THAT KNEE ON 
THAT LAST REBOUND.
>> BUT HE DID GET THE REBOUND 
AND QUICKLY CALLED FOR A 
TIME-OUT. 
FRANK O'NEILL, LOS ANGELES 
LAKER TRAINER CHECKING IT.
>> WHAT HE'S DOING IS PUTTING 
THAT FREON ON THE KNEE, FREEZES 
THE SPOT THAT WAS TWISTED, NOT 
ALLOWING IT TO SWELL. 
WILT CHAMBERLAIN REALLY TWISTED 
THAT KNEE ON THAT REBOUND.
THIS COULD BE A BIG FACTOR IN 
THE CLOSING MINUTES OF THIS 
GAME WORK HIM NOT MOBILE. 
HE HAS FIVE FOULS AND MAY NOT 
BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND QUITE AS 
WELL. 
THERE YOU SEE BILL RUSSELL AT 
THE OTHER END OF THE FLOOR,

CENTER PICKING UP ON THAT PICK, 
UNLIKE WILT CHAMBERLAIN IN THE 
FIRST HALF. 
HE'S A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE 
ON THE PICK.
>> 3:21 REMAINING HERE IN 
CALIFORNIA, BOSTON 103, LOS 
ANGELES 100.
MEN OF THE SQUARE TABLE,
AS A CULTURE, DO WE WANT
TO BE REMEMBERED FOR THIS?
IT'S HILARIOUS.
PEOPLE LAUGH
BECAUSE IT'S MORONIC.
NOT BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY.
THIS IS MAN LAW,
NOT CAVEMAN LAW.
HEY, HAVE YOU DONE IT? NO!
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
CRUSHING BEER CANS
ON YOUR FOREHEAD IS WRONG.
TRIPLE H IS RIGHT. CANS AIN'T
AS THICK AS THEY ONCE WERE.
I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY, YOU
CRUSH A CAN ON YOUR FOREHEAD,
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING,
BUT NOW--
IT'S LAME.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAN LAW?
[ Together ]
MAN LAW.
THE GREAT TASTE
OF MILLER LITE.

CROWD.
3:21 REMAINING IN THE GAME, 
FAINL GAME,HAMPIONSHIP GAME, 
CELTICS WITH A LEAD OF 17 CUT

ON THIS SIDE. 
ERICSON ON THE FAR SIDE.
MEL COUNTS. 
THE LAKERS WITHIN ONE POINT OF 
THE LEAD WITH ABOUT 3:00 TO GO.

HAVING A BIG LEAD, BLOWING UP 
YOUR RUNNING GAME, HAVING 
TROUBLE HERE IN THE FOURTH 
PERIOD.

COMING UP TO THE TWO-MINUTE 
MARK IN THIS GAME.
>> TIM BRYANT OVER THERE TRYING 
TO SETTLE EVERYBODY DOWN HE 
DOESN'T WANT ANYBODY TO GET 
EXCITED.
HE WANTS TO WORK ON THE GOOD 
SHOT AND TRY TO WORK IT INTO 
BILL. 
[WHISTLE] 
>> AND CHARGING CALLED ON DONN 
NELSON. 
JERRY WEST NOW CAN GO TO THE 
FOUL LINE, NELSON HAS FOUR 
FOULS.

DONN NELSON, 105-102, 1:15 TO

>> EXCUSE ME, CHRIS, THE 
CELTICS DOUBLE-TEAMING, THEY 
WOULD RATHER HAVE EGAN OR 
ERICSON TO TAKE THE SHOT THAN

THEY'RE DOUBLE AND 
TRIPLE-TEAMING WEST.
>> BILL RUSS WELL A REBOUND.
105-102, 5 T SECONDS TO GO.

LEFT,-SECONDS.
THIS IS IT. 
-- 46 SECONDS.
MEL COUNTS DRIVES ON RUSSELL. 
CAN'T GET IT UP, RUSSELL TAKES 
IT AWAY.
34 SECONDS TO GO. 
>> NOW AT 32 SEBBEDS, CHRIS, 
CELTICS CAN FREEZE OUT THE 
24-SECOND CLOCK, GET IT DOWN TO 
SEVEN SECONDS.
WITH A THREE-POINT LEAD, THEY 
HAVE A GREAT ADVANTAGE. 
>> THE CELTICS AT THE BEGINNING 
OF THIS SERIES TRAILED 0-2, 
CAME BACK TO TIE IT UP, LAKERS 
THEN LED THREE GAMES TO TWO.
BOSTON TIED IT UP SATURDAY AT 
BOSTON GARDEN, NOW IN THE 
SEVENTH GAME, ERICSON COMMITS 
HIS SIXTH FOUL, AND LEAVES THE 
GAME, IT'S LARRY SIEGFRIED AT 
THE LINE. 
ERICSON IS REPLACED BY HAWKINS, 
NUMBER ONE FOUL SHOOTER IN THE 
NBA.
NOW A FOUR-POINT LEAD WITH 24 
SECONDS LEFT. 
SIEGFRIED WITH SIX POINT BURKS 
THESE ARE BIG ONES. 
SEVEN POINTS. 
NOW A FIVE-POINT LEAD WITH 22 
SECONDS TO GO, STOLEN BY 
HAVLICEK. 
HE CAN NEARLY RUN OUT THE 
CLOCK.
OVER TO BILL RUSSELL. 
FOUL BY JOHNNY EGAN.
15 SECONDS TO GO. 
BOSTON BY FIVE. 
FOURTH FOUL ON JOHNNY EGAN. 
AND MANY OF THE LOS ANGELES 
FANS ARE BEGINNING TO LEAVE THE 
FORUM.
BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT THUS FAR 
FOR THE OWNER, THE GENERAL 
MANAGER, AND THE MAJORITY OF 
THE 17,560 FANS.
12 SECONDS TO GO, TRAIL BIG 
SIX, EGAN TRIES THE SHOT, 
BAYLOR ON THE REBOUND, FOULED.
DONN NELSON HAS FIVE AND GOING

18 POINTS IN THIS FINAL 
TONIGHT.
NOW IT'S 108-103 WITH SEVEN 
SECONDS.
108-104 A FOUR-POINT LEAD BY 
BOSTON. 
SEVEN SECONDS.
BILL RUSSELL DECIDES THAT -- TO 
TALK IT OVER WITH THE PLAYERS.
THEY LED BY THREE AT THE END OF 
THE FIRST QUARTER, BY THREE AT 
HALFTIME, AND THEN BY 15 AT THE 
END OF THE THIRD QUARTER, AND 
AT ONE TIME, CELTICS WERE ON 
TOP BY 17.
AND WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE TIE IN 
THE BALLGAME. 
THAT WAS 60-60.
WE OFFER MAJOR CARRIERS,
GREAT PLANS,
AND TOP-OF-THE-LINE PHONES,
WHICH, TOGETHER
WITH THE HELPFUL ADVICE
TO MAKE SURE YOU FIND
THE EXACT PHONE YOU NEED,
IS THE REASON WHY
OUR SALES ASSOCIATES

NEIGHBORHOOD WIRELESS STORE.
>> BOSTON CELTICS FLYING IN 
YESTERDAY AFTER SLEEPING IN 
BOSTON SATURDAY NIGHT FOLLOWING 
THAT AFTERNOON GAME, WHICH WE 
TELEVISED, WHILE THE LAKERS 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE GAME FLEW 
TO THE WEST COAST.
ARRIVING IN THE WEE HOURS OF 
THE MORNING SUNDAY MORNING. 
AND NOW TONIGHT HAVE HAD THEIR 
HANDS FULL AGAINST THE WORLD 
CHAMPION BOSTON CELTICS.
SO THERE IS SAM JONES, WHO 
FOULED OUT. 
WITH SIX PERMS. 
HIS SLACK WAS TAKEN UP JUST 
ENOUGH, BUT THEIR BIG LEAD WAS 
ERASED, AS WE LOOK AT JOHN 
HAVLICEK. 
HAVLICEK GETTING IT TO HOWELL, 
AND NOW COUNTING OFF THE 
SECONDS, FOUR, THREE, IT'S A 
STEAL BY JOHNNY EGAN. 
AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT, BOSTON 
SELLICS HAVE DONE IT AGAIN. 
ANOTHER JEWEL IN THAT CROWN.
108-106.
A TWO-POINT VICTORY BY BOSTON.
THERE YOU SEE DONN NELSON, HERE 
COMES BAILEY HOWELL, NOW TOM 
SANDERS, WHO DID NOT GET IN THE 
LINEUP. 
KEITH ERIC SON OF LOS ANGELES, 
A DISAPPOINTED WILL CHAMBERLAIN 
IN HOPES OF BRINGING THE FIRST 
TITLE IN NINE YEARS TO LOS 
ANGELES.
BUT THE BOSTON CELTICS, 
AVERAGING 32 YEARS OF AGE, 
LAKERS 30, AND OF COURSE YOU'LL 
HAVE TO SAY THAT THE CELTICS, 
GREATEST SPORTS DYNASTY IN THE 
HISTORY OF PROFESSIONAL 
ATHLETICS.
OF COURSE A MOST VALUABLE 
PLAYER AWARD WILL BE GIVEN HERE 
TONIGHT FOR THE MAN MOST 
VALUABLE DURING THE ENTIRE 
SEVEN GAMES, AND JERRY WEST HAS 
WON IT. 
CERTAINLY A GREAT PERFORMER, 
AVERAGING OVER 30 POINTS, 
TONIGHT ANOTHER BIG SCORING 
NIGHT COMING THRU WITH 42, THE 
BOSTON CELTICS HAD THEIR 
SCORING PRETTY MUCH SPREAD 
AROUND. 
AND THE FANS DOWN ON THE FLOOR, 
AND IN THE EVENT OF A LAKER 
VICTORY HERE AT THE FORUMMARK, 
MANY BALLOONS HANG IN THE 
RAFTERS.
THEY WILL NOT BE RELEASED, 
BECAUSE THE CELTICS HAVE WON IT 
BY TWO POINTS.
SINCE THE SPRING OF 1959. 
>> OK, I'M HERE WITH RED 
AUERBACH AND SAM JONES. 
SAM, CONGRATULATIONS WHAT A 
GREAT LAST GAME.
>> IT WAS TOUGH, GOES TO SHOW 
YOU, WE HAD TO WIN ONE ON THEIR 
HOME COURT, THIS WAS THE BUN, 
THIS WAS THE GREATEST.
>> SAM, WHAT A WAY TO GO OUT. 
WHAT DID YOU SAY AT HALFTIME TO 
GET EVERYBODY, I MADE THE 
REMARK THAT LATE IN THE 
BALLGAME, YOU APPEARED TO BE 
MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE LAKERS. 
>> I KNEW IT WAS MY LAST GAME, 
YF TO SAVE UP FOR NEXT YEAR OR 
ANYTHING. 
A LOT OF PRIDE, I WANT TO THANK 
THE FANS BACK HOME IN BOSTON. 
THEY'VE BEEN WONDERFUL. 
>> WHAT ABOUT PUTTING YOU INTO 
THE BALLGAME, SAM WORK EIGHT 
MINUTES TO GO IN THE BALLGAME 
WITH FIVE FOULS, WHAT DID RUSS 
HAVE IN MIND WHEN HE PUT YOU IN 
WITH THAT MUCH TIME LEFT? 
>> HE PUT ME IN TO SHOOT, 
BECAUSE WE WASN'T GETTING THE 
BALL TO THE HOOPS.
JERRY WEST IS ONE OF THE 
TOUGHEST BALLPLAYERS I'VE 
PLAYED AGAINST, I HAD TO GO OUT 
AND PLAY MY GAME, I FOULED OUT, 
BUT IT FELT GOOD. 
>> THIS IS PROBABLY YOUR 
GREATEST WIN, RIGHT?
>> YEAH.
I WANT TO SAY, JERRY WEST WAS 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST 
THINGS I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFE.
I TELL YOU, I HAD TO STAND UP 
EVERY TIME HE GOT THE BALL. 
>> I KNOW BILL RUSS SELL RIGHT 
BEHIND US, HE WANTS YOU IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM, WE'RE GOING TO LET 
YOU GO. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
RED, THANK YOU. 
NOW LET'S GO BACK UP TO CHIP. 
>> WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY UP, 50 
FEET HIGH, AWAY FROM THE 
PLAYING CONSIDERATE, THOSE FEW 
FANS WHO WERE HERE IN THE LAND 
OF THE LAKERS WHO ARE BOSTON 
FNS ARE TRYING TO GET NEAR THE 
CELTICS, BUT I BELIEVE THE 
CELTICS ARE ALL IN THE LOCKER 
ROOM. 
COACH BILL RUSSELL INDICATED HE 
WANTS TO CLOSE THE DOORS SO 
JUST THE PLAYERS AND FRONT 
OFFICE PLAYERS COULD HAVE A 
MOMENT OF RELAXATION AND SORT 
OF SAVOR, SORT OF SOAK IN THEIR 
11TH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN 13 
YEARS.
THEY HAVE NEVER LOST IN A SEVEN 
GAME IN A FINAL PLAYOFF SERIES. 
BILL RUSSELL, WHO HAS BEEN WITH 
THEM THE LONGEST, THIS WAS HIS 
165TH PLAYOFF GAME IN A 13 WILL 
HAVE YEAR CAREER. 
HE HAS BEEN IN NINE SERIES 
WHERE IT WENT SEVEN GAME, NEVER 
LOSING. 
HERE ARE THE FINAL STATISTICS 
IN THIS FINAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
GAME. 
JERRY WEST THE MOST VALUABLE 
PLAYER IN THE SERIES, 42 
POINTS, ELGIN BAYLOR, 20, 
CHAMBERLAIN WITH 18, EGAN WITH 
, COUNTS WITH EIGHT, ERICSON 
WITH SIX. 
THE CELTICS LED BY HAVLICEK, 
JONES, BRYANT.
AS FOR REBOUNDS.
WILT CHAMBERLAIN WITH 22, BILL 
RUSSELL WITH 19.
AND NEAR THE END OF THE GAME, 
YOU'LL RECALL WILT CHAMBERLAIN 
INJURED A RIGHT KNEE, TAKEN 
OUT, REPLACED BY MEL COUNTS WHO 
AGAIN HAD A FINE GAME FOR THE 
LAKERS, BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH.
A RIVALRY RENEWED AS LOS 
ANGELES AND BOSTON HAVE BEEN IN 
THE FINALS FOR THE LASTING 
AYEARS. 
NOW THE LAKE VERSE LOST ALL 
SIX.
IT WAS RIGHT HERE IN LOS 
ANGELES LAST YEAR THAT THE 
CELTICS WON THEIR 10TH CROWN 
AND THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE NBA, DATING BACK 
TO 19-, 23 YEARS A TEAM HAS 
FINISHED AS LOW AS FOURTH IN A 
DIVISION TO COME ON AND WIN THE 
TITLE.
BOSTON, OF COURSE, DOING IT AS 
THEY CAME THROUGH AGAINST 
PHILADELPHIA IN THE 
QUARTERFINALS, FOUR VICTORIES 
TO ONE, AND IN THE SEMIS, 
AGAINST TOUGH NEW YORK, 4-2, 
WHILE THE LAKERS CAME IN 
WINNING THE WESTERN DIVISION 
AND WINNING A QUARTER FINAL 
PLAYOFF SERIES AGAINST SAN 
FRANCISCO 4-2 AND THE 
SEMIFINALS AGAINST THE ATLANTA 
HAWKS, FOUR GAMES TO ONE. 
WELL THERE YOU SEE JACK WALL 
DREN, THE EXECUTIVE OF -- 
WALDREN, EXECUTIVE OF THE 
COMPANY THAT OWNS THE CELTICS.
>> I'M HERE WITH BILL RUSSELL.
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT WIN 
FOR YOU.
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT'S 
IN YOUR MIND, THIS MUST HAVE 
BEEN A GREAT WIN. 
>> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT BUNCH 
OF GUYS YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN SO 
GREAT THE WAY THEY PLAYED FOR 
ME. 
IT SOUNDS CORNY TO START 
TALKING LIKE THAT, BUT I TOLD 
THE GUYS, I DON'T CARE WHAT 
HAPPENS, I WOULDN'T TRADE YOU 
GUYS FOR ANY OTHER GUYSED IN 
THE WORLD.
>> THAT WAS REALLY OBVIOUS, 
LEADERSHIP HAS TO COME FROM YOU 
AND TO BRING A TEAM FROM FOURTH 
PLACE TO THE WORLD TITLE, THE 
11TH TITLE IN 14 YEARSERING 
YOU'VE GOT THE RESPECT OF 
EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY. 
>> IT'S MY GUYS.
IT'S JUST MY GUYS.
THESE GUYS ARE SUCH A GREAT 
BUNCH OF GUYS, I CAN'T SAY 
ENOUGH ABOUT THE GUYS.
>> LET ME GET JOHN HAVLICEK.
JOHN, SEND JOHN OVER HERE.
WHAT A GREAT GAME.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?
>> I'M TELLING YOU, EVERY TIME 
WE COME INTO THIS SERIES, IT 
SEEMS LIKE IT GETS TOUGHER AND 
TOUGHER EACH YEAR AND ONE OF 
THESE DAYS I'M GOING TO BE ABLE 
TO RETIRE AND WATCH SOMEONE 
ELSE SIT BACK AND WORK SO HARD 
TO DO IT. 
WHAT WE GO THROUGH IS AN 
EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE THAT'S 
GETTING TO ME EVERY YEAR. 
>> JOHN, BILL, EVERYBODY, 
CONGRATULATIONS A GREAT YEAR 
AND A GREAT SEASON. 
NOW BACK UP TO CHRIS. 
>> SO THERE'S DEFINITELY 
HAPPINESS IN BOSTON TONIGHT AS 
THE FINAL SCORE OF THE CELTICS, 
108, LOS ANGELES, 106.
>> WITH THAT BILL RUSSELL AND 
THE CELTICS ADDED THE CLOSING 
CHAPTER TO THEIR REMARKABLE RUN 
OF 11 CHAMPIONSHIPS IN 13 
YEARS.
THIS ONE PERHAPS THE MOST 
SATISFYING OF ALL AS THEY SENT 
RUSSELL, THEIR PLAYER-COACH, 
OFF INTO RETIREMENT WITH ONE 
MORE TITLE. 
IT ALSO ENDED ONE PHASE OF THE 
LAKER-CELTIC RIVALRY. 
BOSTON HAD WON ALL SIX OF THEIR 
MATCH YULLS IN THE 1960'S, 
LMPLE A. WOULD HAVE TO WAIT 
ANOTHER 16 YEARS BEFORE GETTING 
A MEASURE OF REVENGE WHEN MAGIC 
JOHNSON LED THE SHOWTIME LAKERS 
INTO A VICTORY. 
THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF 
"HARDWOOD CLASSICS."
NEXT TIME, USE FedEx.G.G.
>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT "PISTOL" 
PETE MARAVICH, IN MY OPINION 
THE GREATEST PLAY MAREK PLAYING 
TODAY.
GREAT PASSER, GREAT SHOOTER A 
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, 
HE IS WONDERFUL AT ALL THESE 
DEXTERITY DRILLING. 
PETE, WHEN DID YOU START ALL 
THIS? 
>> COMES OUT OF A SYSTEM I 
STARTED AROUND SIX OR SEVEN 
YEARS OF AGE, HOMEWORK 
BASKETBALL, IT IMPROVES YOUR 
QUICKNESS, COORDINATION AND 
YOUR OVERALL ABILITY TO HANDLE 
A BASKETBALL. 
>> DON'T YOU GET THE FEELING 
THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THESE 
THING, THE BALL BECOMES SORT OF 
AN EXTENSION OF YOUR HAND?
>> EXACTLY. 
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I FELT WHEN 
I WAS GROWING UP. 
I DRIBBLED SO MUCH, SO MANY 
DIFFERENT WAYS, LEARNING NEW 
TYPES TO HAVE DRILL TO DRIBBLE 
WITH ONE BALL, TWO BALLS SO 
FORTH, I NEVER REALLY HAD TO 
LOOK AT THE BASKETBALL, WHICH 
IMPROVED MY GAME FROM A GREAT 
STANDPOINT. 
>> A LOT OF COACHES THAT 
ADVOCATE THIS, BUT THEY DON'T 
DO IT WITH ANY APPLICATION TO 
THE GAME ITSELF.
NOW YOU'D BE AMAZED AT SOME OF 
THE THINGS THAT PETE WILL 
DEMONSTRATE TO YOU. 
PETE, HOW ABOUT SHOWING US A 
FEW OF THEM.
>> NUMBER ONE, I DID THIS FOR 
QUICKNESS, JUST TO IMPROVE MY 
QUICKNESS, A RICOCHET DRILL YOU 
STAND WITH YOUR FEET APART, 
THROW THE BALL DOWN, BACK AND 
FORTH LIKE THIS.
THIS IS JUST FOR COORDINATION 
PURPOSES. 
ONCE YOU GET INTO THE BULLET 
RICOCHET, YOU TRY TO THROW THE 
BALL VERY HARD. 
AND CATCH IT BEHIND.
THAT'S ONE 
>> BEAUTIFUL. 
>> ANOTHER ONE, A VERY GOOD 
QUICKNESS DRILL THAT I HAVEN'T 
DONE THAT MUCH, COACH, EXCEPT 
IN THE SUMMERTIME, THE OBJECT 
IS TO PUT THE BALL BLIND YOUR 
KNEES, CLAB YOUR HANDS IN FRONT 
AND CATCH THE BALL BEFORE IT 
HITS THE GROUND.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL GET IT BUT 
I'LL TRY. 
>> HOW ABOUT A COUPLE OF MORE 
PETE? 
>> I CAN TAKE TWO BALLS SHOW A 
SHORT DRILL WHICH IS JUST A 
SHORT FIGURE EIGHT DRILL USING 
TWO BASKETBALLS.
WE CALL IN RHYTHMS AND OUT 
RHYTHMS AND GOING AROUND. 
THIS REALLY INCREASES YOUR 
ABILITY TO HANDLE BASKETBALLS.
>> WHEN YOU SEE A LOOSE BALL, 
AND THAT BALL IS A COUPLE 
INCHES FROM THE GROUND, DON'T 
YOU FEEL REAL SUPERIOR TO THE 
NEXT GUY, KNOWING THAT YOU 
COULD START A DRIBBLE FROM THAT 
LOW POSITION? 
>> EXACTLY. 
ONE OF THE BEST MOVES I HAVE, 
PARTICULARLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL, 
IS PUTTING THE BALL OUT IN 
FRONT OF SOMEBODY, AS THEY GO 
FOR IT DORK WHAT I CALL STUTTER 
DRIBBLE, BACK OVER LIKE THAT 
>> TRY THAT AGAIN.
>> YOU'VE GOT YOUR HAND THERE 
-- 
>> I'M GUARDING HIM, I HAVE A 
FEELING THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
GET THAT BALL BURK THROUGH ALL 
THIS DEXTERITY PRACTICE, HE 
KNOWS THAT HE CAN BEAT MY 
REACTION AND GO BY ME.
NOW WOULD YOU ADVIDSE YOUNG 
PLAYERS OUT THERE TO DO THOSE 
THINGS? 
>> A KID NEEDS SPEED, 
QUICKNESS, AND ABILITY TO HAVE 
COORDINATION AND THROUGH THESE 
DRILLS I DO, PARTICULARLY, IT 
REALLY HELPED MY GAME AND I CAN 
ONLY WISH THAT EVERYBODY WOULD 
TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE 
BALL. 
WHAT IT DOES IS GIVES YOU GREAT 
CONFIDENCE IN YOUR OVERALL 
ABILITY WHEN YOU CAN DO 
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFERENT, IT REALLY HELPS YOU. 
>> WHAT YOU'VE JUST SEEN HAS A 
DEFINITE PURPOSE. 
THINK.
WHEN YOU WORK AT IT, KEEP 
TELLING YOURSELF HOW CAN THIS 
HELP MY GAME? 
YOU CAN WORK ON IT HARD, 
KNOWING THAT THIS WILL IMPROVE 
YOUR GAME.
>> VERY GOOD. 
I HAVE HERE LARRY BIRD, 
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS, 
BOSTON CELTICS, RETRIEVING THE 
BALL, DENNIS JOHNSON, PREMIERE 
GUARD OF THE CELTICS. 
LARRY, YOU'RE SHOOTING A FREE 
THROW, GOT TO KNOW THAT A FREE 
THROW IS A FREE THROW.
NOBODY WILL BOTHER YOU. 
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE TIME.
WHEN YOU'VE GOT THIS TIME, 
LARRY TO SHOOT THE BALL, WHAT 
GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND? 
>> FIRST THING IS TO GET MY 
EYES FOCUSED ON THE FRONT OF 
THE RIM.
SECOND THING, TO GET IN 
POSITION WHERE I FEEL MOST 
COMFORTABLE AT, AND THE THIRD 
THING IS TO GET MY HAND 
SITUATED ON THE BALL WHICH 
FEELS BEST TO ME. 
I USE THE SEAMS AS A GUIDE. 
THE FOURTH THING IS, I GET MY 
FEET SET, GET DOWN IN POSITION, 
FOL THROUGH WITH MY ARM.
>> YOU NOTICE HOW HE MENTIONED 
IT, THE SEAMS.
THIS BALL IS DIFFERENT FROM A 
COLLEGE BASKETBALL, BECAUSE THE 
SEAMS ARE A LITTLE WIDER. 
DOES THAT HELP YOU? 
>> IT DOES IN MY FEEL OF THE 
BALL AND GETTING MY HANDS 
SITUATED BETTER.
>> NOTICE HOW LARRY SAID HIS 
KNEES ARE BENT AND GOES UP HE 
DOESN'T GO THROUGH HO BOTH 
MOTIONS OF DOWN AND THEN UP.
HE'S ALREADY DOWN WHEN HE 
SHOOTS IT.
NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, 
SHOOTING A SHOT OF ANY KIND, 
ESPECIALLY A FREE THROW, HE 
MENTIONED IT, THESE THINGS 
DON'T COME BY ACCIDENT, YOUR 
EYE ON THE BASKET.
THE POSITION OF THE HEAD. 
NOW LARRY, YOU ALWAYS GRAB THE 
SEAMS, IF I THROW YOU THE BALL, 
AUTOMATICALLY HE'LL TOUCH THE 
SEAMS AND GET IT AND GET IT 
BACK. 
NOW WATCH, AUTOMATICALLY, 
QUICKLY.
VERY GOOD.
ONE MORE TIME.
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT.
THE SEAMS.
NOW WHY DO YOU HAVE THE BACK 
SPIN? 
WHY DO PEOPLE SHOOT THAT BALL 
LIKE THAT?
GREAT SHOOTERS. 
>> WELL BECAUSE ONCE THE BALL 
HITS THE RIM, YOU'VE GOT THE 
BACK SPIN ON IT, YOU CAN HIT 
THE RIM AND IT DIVES AND 
BOUNCES AROUND YOU CAN GET A 
BETTER ROLL ON IT.
>> THAT'S WHY GREAT SHOOTERS, 
IT HITS THE RIM, ROLLS AROUND, 
AND DROPS IN. 
THAT'S REASON WHY IT HAPPENS. 
NOTICE WHAT HE SAID, FLOLE 
THROUGH.
CONCENTRATION.
POSITION OF THE HAND. 
ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS, 
AND REMEMBER, THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING OF ALL ON A 
FREE THROW, OR A FOUL SHOT, 
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, 
IS THAT IT'S FREE.
NOBODY IS BOTHERING YOU.
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE

I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE
BETTER THAN ME.
>> A TEACHER ENCOURAGED HIM
TO SWITCH TO A PRIVATE
CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
>> SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I
STAY ON RIGHT TRACK.
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK
BEING IN THE GHETTO, OR
GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD
HAVE DETERRED ME AT ALL.

AT THAT PARTICULAR STAGE OF
MY LIFE AND, I WASN'T GOING

YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE AND
LOVE FOR HIM DOING THAT FOR
ME.
NOT LEAVING ME AND STILL,
CONTINUING HIS DREAM AS, HE
HAS GONE THROUGH BASEBALL
BEING THERE FOR ME AS I GREW

HIM?
HE SAYS SOME THINGS ON

BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALLY
SAY IT TO ME.
BUT, HE'S A SPECIAL KID.

>> I JUST REMEMBER MY DAD
SAYING TO ME, YOU KNOW WHAT?
OKAY, IT'S HAPPENED.

FASTER THAN YOU WANTED TO.
I WILL BE THERE EVERY DAY TO
HELP YOU THROUGH.
WHEN HE SAID THAT TO ME,

TALK I KNEW EVERYTHING WAS
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE
IT ALL RIGHT.
>> SO AT RUTGERS HE PLAYED
FOOTBALL, REQUIRED BY HIS
SCHOLARSHIP AND BASEBALL,
BECAUSE HE LOVED IT.

THEY FOUND OUT MY NECK WAS
BROKEN OR WHATEVER.
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE.
I WANT TO GET UP.
I WANT TO GET UP AND LOOK

MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS
OKAY.

UP.
BOTH OF MY LIPS SPLIT.
MY JAW IS UNHINGED A LITTLE
BIT.
MY FACE IS BURNING.
EXTENSIVELY.
I HAD A HEADACHE, OUT OF
THIS WORLD.
BUT I WAS CALM THOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY UNTIL I GOT
IN AMBULANCE THEY STARTED
CUTTING MY CLOTHE OFF.
THEY ONLY DO THAT WHEN THERE
IS SOMETHING SERIOUS.
I WAS REAL SERIOUSLY IN
DISTRESS INSIDE BECAUSE I
KNEW THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN
THEY TOOK ME OFF THE FIELD
THAT MAY BE MY LAST TIME
GOING BACK ON A BASEBALL
FIELD.

NATE THE GREAT KOLBERT AL
FERRARO, STEVE ALLEN, GASTON
LED ON THE FIELD BY GOMEZ
THESE WERE PLAYERS WITH A
PURPOSE, INCLUDING ONE GUY
WITH A BIG OFF THE FIELD

>> I THINK FOR A LOT OF
YOUNG PLAYERS IN 69, 70, 71,
THEY WERE FRUSTRATED OTHER
ORGANIZATION, AND COMING TO
SAN DIEGO GAVE THEM THE ONE
SHOT THAT EVERY PLAYER THAT
SIGNS WANTS HE WANTS A SHOT
TO PLAY A YEAR OR TWO IN THE

AND THAT FIRST PADRE ALE

>> EVEN SO, THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THAT EVENING IS NOT LOST
ON THE NEW PADRE.
>> WE ARE A BUNCH RAGTAG
PLAYERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO
SHOW SOMEBODY SOMETHING.
IT WAS A BIG LEAGUE.
AND I REALLY DIDN'T CARE IF

MAJOR LEAGUE SIMPLE WE ALL
WANTED TO DO -- AND EVERY
TIME PUT ON A UNIFORM KEPT
REMINDING MYSELF I'M A MAJOR
LEAGUE PLAYER, MAJOR LEAGUE
PLAYER, WE HAD A TOUGH YEAR
THAT YEAR.
BUT WE ALL GREW.
AND END OF THE YEAR WE FELT
THAT WE WERE MAJ
FOR SECOND BASE MAN THAT WAS
SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
VERY OFTEN, HE WAS THE FIRST
MAN TO SAY OH, YOU KNOW AS
LONG AS I CAN HIT OH, --
>> HE WAS -- SORT OF A CAL
RIPKEN OF HIS ERA, HIT THE
POWER, AND WAS A GOLD-GLOVE
WINNING SECOND BASEMAN
COMBINED A LITTLE BIT OF
EVERYTHING.
>> RINO INCREDIBLE MADE
EVERYTHING LOOK EASY.
>> MADE SO MANY PLAYS,
ALMOST LIKE CONCERT PIANIST
OUT THERE.
>> SOMETIME -- TUNE OF 9
GOLD GLOVES, SET A RECORD
123 CONSECUTIVE ERRORLESS

HE WON THE MVP AWARD LED THE

SINCE 1945.
>> I GOT ALL KINDS OF, 84,

>> I WANTED TO GETTING
CAUGHT UP IN THE -- DO MY
JOB, AND JUST GLAD TO HELP

PART OF IT.
>> CUBBIES FELL SHORT OF THE
WORLD SERIES THAT YEAR, AND
AGAIN, IN 1989, LEAVING RINO
WITHOUT ONE THING IN
BASEBALL HE CHERISHED MOST.
>> MY GOAL WAS TO MAKE IT
THROUGH A WORLD SERIES, JUST
-- TOUGH TO DO REALLY IS
TOUGH TO DO NOT EVERYBODY
GETS TO MAKE IT.
>> I CAN SAY THAT THE TWO
YEARS, ONE DIVISION VERSUS
TWO BEST CHANCES TO GET IN
THE WORLD SERIES THINGS
DIDN'T WORK OUT.
>> REGARDLESS, HIS LEGACY IS
SECURE.
ONE OF THE BEST SECOND BASEMEN
EVER TO PLAY THE GAME!.

PLAY WITH HIM SIX YEARS, AND,
IT WAS JOY.
BECAUSE ALL ALONG I KNEW
THAT I WAS PLAYING ALONGSIDE

THESE BAGS ON THIS TABLE
TELL THE STORY OF LIFE IN
THE LATE 1800s IN EAST
VILLAGE, WHERE POPE PETCO
STANDS TODAY.
AS HORTON STARTED TO DEVELOP
DOWNTOWN, AND THE RAILROAD
WAS BUILT.
>> THERE WAS A ENORMOUS
POPULATION BOOM HERE IN THE
MID 1880s.
>> BUT ORDERLY ENOUGH THIS
STORY STARTS IN THE BATHROOM,
OR WHAT WAS CALLED THE PRIVY
BIG HOLES IN GROUND USED AS
HOW THE HOUSES BEFORE INDOOR
PLUMBING WAS INVENTED.
>> FOUND, BECAUSE THEY WERE
BURIED DEEP UNDERGROUND, AND
SURVIVED LATER, CONSTRUCTION,
THEY PROVIDE INTERESTING
LOOK AT THE DOMESTIC LIFE IN
A LOFTHOUSE HOLDS.
SOMETIMES --
>> THE SECRET LIFE BECAUSE
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, NOT
ONLY WAS THERE PRIVACY, BUT
THERE WAS A BIG HOLE IN THE
GROUND, TO THROW AWAY THE
EVIDENCE.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE
FIND A LOT OF IN THESE KINDS
OF -- LIQUOR BOTTLES
MEDICINE BOTTLES, CERTAINLY
SEEMED A LOT OF DRINKING OF
ALCOHOL.
>> THE VARIETY OF BOTTLES
EXCAVATED REFLECTS THE
POPULARITY OF EVERY KIND OF
ALCOHOL.
>> -- JAMAICA GINGER THAT
WAS A MEDICINAL KIND OF --
AND YEAH, ALCOHOL CONTENT.
KIND OF PUMPKIN SEED THE
GLASSK A WHISKEY GLASSK MADE
SMALL ONES YOU COULD PUT IN
YOUR BACK POCKET.
>> BEYOND PRODIGIOUS DRINKING
THAT WAS GOING ON.
>> ONE OF THE MOST
SURPRISING THINGS WE FOUND
ON THE PARTICULAR BLOCK IN
THE AREA THAT WHERE THE PARK
IS NOW EVIDENCE OF OPIUM
SMOKING, THIS IS A OPIUM
SMOKING LAMP.
A FUNCTION WAS TO HEAT THE
OPIUM, IN THE HEATED OPIUM
WOULD PUT OFF FUMES THAT IS
WHAT WOULD BE SMOKED.
>> THIS AREA WAS FILLED WITH
BOARDING HOUSES WHERE
LABORERS RAILROAD WORKERS
LONG SHEERMEN LIVE PEOPLE
LIVED RIGHT AROUND HEAVY
INDUSTRY, AND THE BUSINESSES
THAT THEY WORKED IN.
>> AND THIS -- THERE ARE
MANY SIGNS OF FAMILY LIFE.
>> WE FOUND A WHOLE SET OF
PORCELAIN DOLLS WOULD HAVE
BEEN SEWN ON, CLOTH, OTHER
PORT TREAT THIS ONE IS
PARTICULARLY --
AND YOU FIND LOTS OF MARBLES,
FROM -- CHILDREN, A MARBLE
ACTUALLY MADE FROM MARBLE,
HERE IS A BEAUTIFUL AGATFRE

>> ONLY SMOKING TOBACCO IN
THIS TOO TIE -- SNIPE AS FAR
AS WE KNOW.
>> OKAY.
>> SOMETIMES YOU FIND COINS
AS WELL.
AND I GUESS UNLESS IT IS
WOULD FALL OUT OF POCKETS
WHEN PEOPLE USING PRIVY
UNLESS A 5 DOLLAR GOLD
PIECES NOBODY IS GOING TO GO
AFTER IT.
>> GOOD POINT.
>> THERE'S A -- A BONE,
TOOTHBRUSH, WITH A BRISTLES
GONE NOW OF COURSE, HERE IS
A READING GLASS, AND YOU CAN
SEE THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT BE
PUT IN A PARLOR, MOST
EXCITING THING WHEN WE MAKE,
DISCOVERIES ABOUT HOW PEOPLE
LIVED IN THE PAST THAT WERE

MATT: FORMERLY THE BALLPARK IN 
ARLINGTON NOW GOING BY AMERICA 
QUEST FIELD.
A LITTLE EARL, "PRIME TIME 
PADRES" AS YOUR PADRES GET READY
FOR THE TEXAS RANGERS TONIGHT.
WELCOME BACK, MATT VASGERSIAN 
ALONG WITH MARK GRANT, AND FANS 
READY TO PUT THIS BASKETBALL 
THING BEHIND THEM.
MARK: THE MAVS LOST TO THE HEAT 
LAST NIGHT.
THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE.
I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR THEM.
MATT: PEOPLE RIDING OFF THE 
MAVERICKS AFTER THE SEASON NOW, 
AND SOME MAY HAVE WRITTEN OFF 
VINNY CASTILLA, BUT LOOK AT HIM 
NOW.
MARK: 14 GAMES IN JUNE, THE 
SLUGGING PERCENTAGE, .591 IS THE
ONE THAT STICKS OUT.
THIS BALL OVER THE HEART OF THE 
PLATE AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, 
VINNY, YOU ARE NOW FREE TO MOVE 
ABOUT SECOND BASE, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH.
DID YOU SWEE THAT SWING?
MOSTLY UPPER BODY, STAYING BACK 
ON IT, GOING TO RIGHT CENTER 
FIELD.
TWO TIMES, VINNY TO LEFT CENTER 
AND RIGHT CENTER FIELD.
THIS IS ONE GUY THAT THE PADRES 
NEED TO KEEP HOT IN THEY WANT TO
STAY IN THE RACE WITH.
MATT: GOT A DEAL GOING ON WITH 
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, NOW, TOO?
MARK: NONSTOP TO CHICAGO.
MATT: BEN JOHNSON RETURNS TO THE
BIG LEAGUE LEVEL AND HE MADE AN 
IMPACT LAST NIGHT.
HE HAS A CONVERSATION WITH MUD 
NEXT.
WE'LL SEE HOW MANY NOT SO MODEST
PLUGS MY PARTNER WITH THROW IN 
THERE.
MARK: WELCOME BACK TO HOT, 
WINDY, STICKY TEXAS AND WE'RE 
GOING TO BE JOINED WITH THE 
MEMPHIS FLASH, BEN JOHNSON AND 
HE PAID DIVIDENDS YESTERDAY, 
BACK TO THE BIG LEAGUES.
GREAT TO BE BACK, I WOULD 
SUPPOSE, BEN, AND THE FIRST 
QUESTION IS THE DIFFERENCES.
YOU'VE BEEN BACK AND FORTH A 
COUPLE OF TIMES.
PSYCHOLOGICALLY HOW DO YOU DEAL 
WITH THAT?
>>BEN: YOU HAVE TO STEP INTO A 
DIFFERENT ROUTINE WHEN YOU GET 
CALLED INTO THE MAJOR LEAGUES.
DIFFERENT BUS TIMES, HITTING 
TIMES, IT DEFINITELY -- THERE IS
A TRANSITION PERIOD.
I KNOW IT HELPS, THOUGH, KNOWING
WHAT TO EXPECT FIRSTHAND.
IT HELPS ME WITH THE TRANSITION,
MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER, I 
GUESS, YEAH.
MARK: THE MINOR LEAGUES IN 
PORTLAND YOU'RE PLAYING EVERY 
DAY.
YOU CAN COME TO THE BALLPARK AND
COME GEARED TO PLAY EVERY DAY.
IN THE BIG LEAGUES HOW DOES THAT
WORK MENTALLY, WHEN YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO?
>>BEN: I TRY TO GET SWINGS IN 
AND WORKING OUT IN THE OUTFIELD.
TODAY I GOT TO THE BALLPARK 
EARLIER, AND BOCH TOLD ME I 
WOULDN'T BE PLAYING, SO CAME 
HERE, GOT A GOOD WORK OUT IN, 
LIFTED WEIGHTS FOR 35, FORTY 
MINUTES, AND YOU CAN MAKE EVERY 
DAY PRODUCTIVE.
MARK: TALK TO ME ABOUT THE TEAM 
IN PORTLAND, HOW IS EVERYBODY 
DOING THERE?
>>BEN: EVERYBODY IS DOING WELL.
BATS ARE STARTED COMING AFRNLTD 
AND WE WERE SCUFFLING A LITTLE 
BIT THERE FOR A WHILE BUT 
THERE'S A GOOD BALL TEAM THERE, 
TOO.
MARK: TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE 
IN THE BATS BETWEEN TRIPLE-A AND
THE BIG LEAGUES.
YOU'VE GOT GUYS COMING UP AND 
VETERANS COMING DOWN.
TALK ABOUT THE SCOUTING REPORT.
IS IT AS ADVANCED AS IT IS HERE?
>>BEN: NO, WAY, A LOOT OF TIMES 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS PITCHING 
THAT DAY UNTIL HE STEPS ON THE 
MOUND.
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
NO VIDEO WORK.
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BALLPARK 
EARL AND EXPECT TO SEE PITCHES 
FROM A GUY.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR NOTES AND 
WORD OF MOUTH IS THE BEST WAY TO
GET A SCOUTING REPORT ON THE 
GUY.
MARK: TALK ABOUT BOCH BECAUSE HE
LIKES TO FILL EVERYBODY IN IN 
THEIR ROLE AND WHAT YOU WERE 
CALLED UP, WHAT DES TO SAY?
>>BEN: WHEN HE PUTS ME IN THERE 
HE WANTS ME TO GIVE IT ALL I 
GOT.
HE'S TOLD ME THAT FROM TIME TO 
TIME, I WANT TO SEE HOW FAST YOU
CAN GO.
HE HASN'T SAID A WHOLE LOT SINCE
EYE BEEN HERE YET.
MARK: TALK ABOUT GROWING UP IN 
MEMPHIS EXAMINE PLAYING HERE IN 
TEXAS IT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE USED
TO.
I KNOW YOU LIKE PLAYING IN SAN 
DIEGO, BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY 
THE BEST WEATHER IN THE UNITED 
STATES, BUT GROWING UP IN THE 
MEMPHIS AREA AND HERE IN TEXAS.
>>BEN: YOU CAN HAVE THE 
HUMIDITY, MARK, AND THERE'S NO 
BETTER WEATHER THAN SAN DIEGO.
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO GET 
LOOSE, HERE, I GUESS, SPRINTS, 
YOU GOT SWEAT GOING, BUT I'D 
RATHER TAKE THE DRY HEAT OVER 
THE HU HEAT.
MARK: BEN, WHEN DO YOU FEEL 
LIKE -- DO YOU HAVE THE SENSE 
NOW THAT YOU'RE LIKE, MAN, THERE
IS A LEARNING CURVE BUT WHEN DO 
YOU GET THAT FEELING THAT YOU'RE
DOING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.
>>BEN: BREAKING CAMP WITH THE 
TEAM I THOUGHT THERE WAS A 
CHANCE THAT I WOULD BE HERE FOR 
THE LONG HAUL, BUT THINGS 
HAPPEN, GUYS GET HURT AND THAT 
AFFECTS ME IN THE CHAIN, YOU 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN, BUT I FEEL 
LIKE I CAN PLAY HERE, I WANT TO 
GET OUT THERE AND GET SOME 
AT-BATS.
DO I BELONG?
I'D SAY SO.
I THINK I'M A MAJOR LEAGUE 
PLAYER.
I TRY TO GO OUT THERE EXAMINE 
PROVE THAT FROM TIME TO TIME.
MARK: YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE 
BENCH TONIGHT BUT THAT DOESN'T 
MEAN YOU WON'T GET AN AT-BAT, A 
GUY LIKE KEFB MILLWOOD, WHAT 
WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO 
PREPARE FOR THE GAME?
>>BEN: I WOULD SEE HOW HE IS 
WORKING ALL THE OTHER 
RIGHT-HANDED HITTERS, MIKE 
CAMERON, MIKE PIAZZA, HOW HE'S 
GOING AFTER THOSE GUYS AND MAKE 
MY APPROACH FROM THERE.
MARK: TALK ABOUT MERV, THE 
HITTING COACH, MERV RETTENMUND, 
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SIT 
DOWN WITH MERV AND GO OVER YOUR 
TENDENCIES?
>>BEN: MERV AND I HAVE SPOKEN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, AND 
BASICALLY HE'S TRYING TO GET ME 
TO SLOW EVERYTHING DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS TRYING 
TO DO THAT'S WORKED WITH ME.
HIM AND I -- I'M LISTENING, AND 
THINGS ARE WORK OUT.
MARK: YOU AND I CROSSED PATHS 
YESTERDAY AND YOU HAD A CUP OF 
COFFEE IN MY HAND.
WHAT DID I SAY TO YOU?
>>BEN: WHAT DID YOU SAY?
MARK: I SAID THAT CUP OF COFFEE 
IS ALWAYS BETTER IN THE MAJOR 
LEAGUES THAN IT IS IN THE MINOR 
LEAGUES.
>>BEN: YEAH, YOU DID, AND 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE.
MARK: MORE COMING UP.
GAME 2 FROM ARLINGTON, COMING UP
AFTER THIS.
@G@K
MATT: IN SAN DIEGO MATCHED UP 
WITH ONE OF THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE'S TOP OFFENSES LAST NIGHT
IT WAS A 6-5 WIN OVER THE 
RANGERS FOR THE PADRES.
TONIGHT ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST 
STARS MAKES HIS RETURN TO THE 
LOAN STAR STATE AS EX-RANGER 
CHRIS YOUNG LOOKS TO WIN A 7TH 
HIGH OF THE YEAR TONIGHT.
IT'S PART 2 OF THE PADRES TEXAS 
2-STEP SO GRAB A PARTNER AND 
SWING AROUND.
GAME 2 OF THE PADRES AND 
RANGERS, NEXT.
AMERIQUEST FIELD, WHERE YOUR 
PADRES CONTEND WITH THE RANGERS.
COUPLE OF DIVISION LEADERS AT IT
AGAIN TONIGHTMENT WELCOME BACK 
TO ARLINGTON, MATT VASGERSIAN 
ALONG WITH MARK GRANT, THE 
PADRES WIN IN A SERIES OPENER, 
IT DID NOT COME WITHOUT NOISE 
FROM THE RANGERS' BATS, THEY 
HAVE SWUNG THEM BIG ALL YEAR 
LONG.
MARK: THE RANGERS LEAD ALL OF 
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WITH 174 
DOUBLES, 10 TRIPLES, AND THE 
HOME RUNS ARE DOWN, BUT THE 
DOUBLES ARE UP.
1 THROUGH 9 THEY CAN HURT YOU.
THEY'RE AGGRESSIVE WITH THAT 
SHILLELAGH AND THEY'RE GOING TO 
GET EXTRA HITS AT THIS BALLPARK.
MATT: TONIGHT IT'S ABOUT A GREAT
PITCHING MATCH-UP.
CHRIS YOUNG FOR SAN DIEGO AS 
GOOD AS HE'S BEEN OVERALL HE'S 
BEEN BETTER ON THE ROAD THIS 
YEAR.
>>> YOU'D LOOV TO HAVE A GUY 
LIKE CHRIS YOUNG ON THE ROAD TO 
TAKE THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND 
WIN YOU BALL GAMES. THESE ARE 
GREAT NUMBERS, BUT LET'S FA IT, 
CHRIS YOUNG WAS IN A TEXAS 
UNIFORM.
THEY KNOW WHAT HE OFFERS OUT 
THERE.
THIS COULD BE A GREAT MATCH-UP.
CHRIS YOUNG KNOWS THEIR 
WEAKNESSES, AND THE HITTERS KNOW
WHAT HE HAS TO OFFER.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ONE.
MATT: THIS IS AN ASSIGNMENT THAT
CHRIS HAS BEEN LOOKING FORWARD 
TO FOR SOME TIME AS WE HAVE AS 
WELL.
THE OTHER HALF OF THE MATCH-UP, 
ONE OF THE ACES ON THE TEXAS 
STAFF, RIGHT HANDER KEVIN MILL 
ROAD WHO HAS HAD HIS SHARE OF 
TROUBLE AT HOME.
A PADRE STARTER GOOD ON THE 
ROAD, A RANGER WHO STRUGGLED IN 
ARLINGTON, SHOULD BE GOOD.
OPENING PITCH, PADRES AND 
RANGERS, COMING UP NEXT.
MATT: WELCOME BACK.
TIME FOR BASEBALL, THE PADRES 
AND THE RANGERS IN GAME 2 OF 
THIS 3-GAME SERIES, TOMORROW'S

BELLHORN FOUR THROUGH 6, FIRST

OF DAYS ON THIS ROAD TRIP, 
GREENE, CASTILLA AND BARFIELD 
ROUND THINGS OUT FOR SAN DIEGO.
GOOD NUMBERS BY A HANDFUL OF 
FRIARS ON THE TRIP.
AND RIGHT HANDER MILLWOOD WILL 
HAVE HIS HANDS FULL.
MILLWOOD 8-3 OVERALL AND HE IS 
AMONG LEADERS IN A CATEGORIES, A
COUPLE, THAT HE'S PROUD OF AND 
HE'S ALSO A LEADER IN 
CATEGORIES, WHICH HE WOULD 
PREFER TO STAY AWAY FROM, THINGS
LIKE HITS ALLOWED, AND HE'S BEEN
HIT HARD AT HOME THIS YEAR.
>>> ON THE ROAD HE IS PITCHING 
LIGHTS OUT BUT HERE IN ARLINGTON
THE NUMBERS DON'T SEEM TO BE IN 
HIS FAVOR.
HE IS A GUY THAT LATE IN THE 
BALL GAME YOU LOOK UP AND HE'S 
GOING TO GO 8 SOLID INNINGS ON 
YOU.
THERE ARE CHANCES YOU CAN GET TO
THE RIGHT HANDER MILLWOOD.
HE'S DEVELOPED INTO A PITCHER AS
HE'S GOTTEN OLDER.
EARL IN THE DAYS HE THREW HARD, 
BUT ALONG WITH THAT FASTBALL 
HE'S INCORPORATED A 2-SEAMER, 
HE'LL CUT THE FASTBALL AND HE 
HAS A CURVE BALL AND A 
CHANGE-UP.
MATT: KEVIN 
MILLWOOD READY 
FOR HIS 16TH 
ASSIGNMENT OF 
THE YEAR, PRICEY

TOUGH DECISION 
WITH BOCH 
STARTING WITH

PREGAME

THEY SAID IT WAS
A 90-DEGREE IN 
DAY, MAY 9TH, 
ACCORDING TO THE
FOLKS I TALKED 
TO HERE AND THEY
HIT HIM OFF THE 
FIRST CYCLE.
THEY THINK THE 
HEAT MAY HAVE 
DONE SOMETHING 
ABOUT THAT 
OUTING.
MATT: AND MIKE 
CAMERON HIT BY A
PITCH, SO MIKE 
ABOARD THE HARD 
WAY WITH 1 GONE 
TO START T 
NIGHT.
THAT'S THE 
SECOND PADRE TO 
HAVE BEEN HIT IN
THE SERIES.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
A 2-SEAMER, YOU 
CAN TELL BY THE 
ROTATION OF THE 
BASEBALL. IT 
GETS IN ON HIM A
LITTLE BIT.
GERALD LAIRD WAS
DOWN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE PLATE.
I THINK HE 
WANTED TO POUND 
THE INNER THIRD 
AND IT GOT AWAY 
FROM HIM.
LIKE ANY PITCHER
YOU WANT TO GET 
THAT 1, 2, 3 
INNING UNDER 
YOUR BELT.
NOW HE WILL HAVE
TO WORK OUT OF 
THE STRETCH.
MATT: SEE IF 
MIKE CAMERON 
LOOKS TO RUN.
GILES NOW, IT 
WAS GILES THAT 
WAS HIT BY A 
PITCH YESTERDAY,
ALONG THE COURSE
OF A 1-4 SERIES 
OPENER FOR BRIAN
YESTERDAY.
HE'S HAD A GREAT
ROAD TRIP 
THROUGH THE A.L.
WEST, 8 FOR 17, 
AND NOW WITH 5 
STARTS ON THE 
TRIP.
SEE IF CAM ROON 
LOOKS FOR A 
CHANCE TO RUN, 
HERE.
MIKE IS ONE OF 
THOSE GUYS WE'VE
NOTED IN THE 
PAST THAT HAS 
THAT PHILOSOPHY,
IF YOU HIT ME 
IT'S GOING TO 
COST YOU TWO 
BASES.
MARK: THAT'S A 
DOUBLE.
MATT: THE 
PROBLEM IS 
TONIGHT GERALD 
LAIRD BEHIND THE
PLATE HAS THROWN
OUT 9 OF 15 BASE
STEELERS, THIS 
YEAR 
MARK: THAT'S 60%
AND THE MAJOR 
LEAGUE AVERAGE 
IS ABOUT 32%.
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON STAYS 
PUT, THAT 
BOUNCES AWAY 
FROM LAIRD AND 
CAMERON IS GOING
TO GET THAT BASE
ANY WAY.
SO A RUNNER IN 
SCORING POSITION
NOW.
MARK: GREAT 
REACTION BY 
CAMERON.
AS SOON AS THAT 
BALL WAS IN THE 
DIRT, IT WAS A 
BREAKING BALL 
AND AS SOON AS 
HE SEES DAYLIGHT
THERE HE IS OFF 
AND RUNNING.
MATT: RUNNER AT 
SECOND, STILL NO
DECISION BY THE 
OFFICIAL SCORER 
AS TO HOW THEY 
GET CAMERON OVER
THERE, WILD 
PITCH OR PASS 
BALL AND GILES 
CATCHES INTO THE
GAP IN RIGHT 
CENTER, AND IT'S
ON, SAN DIEGO IS
ON THE 
SCOREBOARD, 1 
OUT INTO THE 
NIGHT AGAINST 
KEVIN MILLWOOD.
A COSTLY, WILD 
PITCH AS WE 
LEARNED IN THE 
EYES OF THE 
OFFICIAL SCORER,
CONTRIBUTES INTO
A RUN SCORING 
START TO THE 9TH
FOR SAN DIEGO.
MARK: IT LOOKED 
EARLY ON LIKE 
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
WAS GOING TO GO 
AFTER GILES 
AWAY.
SOFT STUFF AWAY,
SINKERS, AWAY.
HE WANTED TO GET
THAT ONE IN 
HERE.
IF YOU WANT TO 
COME IN AGAINST 
A GUY LIKE 
GILES, YOU 
BETTER DARN WELL
GET IT IN THERE 
AND TIE HIM UP.
THAT LEAK OVER 
THE HEART OF THE
PLATE AND THE HE
SMOKED IT.
THAT'S A GOOD 
SIGN, MIKE 
CAMERON SCORING 
A RUN, AND HIGH 
FIVE'S ALL THE 
WAY AROUND.
MAYBE IT WILL BE
901 TONIGHT FOR 
BRUCE BOCHY.
MATT: MIKE 
PIAZZA NOW UP TO
THE PLATE, 
TRYING TO PICK 
UP GILES AND GET
HIM IN.
THE LEAD CHANGED
HANDS 3 TIMES 
LAST NIGHT AND 
THIS IS AS CLOSE
AS YOU GET, THE 
KIND OF GAME 
WHERE YOU CAN'T 
COUNT ANYTHING 
DONE UNTIL 
EVERYBODY IS 
SHOWERING.
1-1 TO PIAZZA.
THE RANGERS, BY 
THE WAY, AFTER 
THE SERIES 
OPENER START 
PLAY TONIGHT 
TECHNICALLY TIED
FOR A SHARE OF 
THE WESTERN 
LEAGUE DIVISION 
OF THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE AS 
OAKLAND WAS SHUT
OUT FOR THE 
SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE GAME
IN DENVER 
YESTERDAY.
, AND PIAZZA 
BOUNCES THAT TO 
YOUNG.
THAT'S OUT NO. 
2.
HAVE YOU LOOKED 
AT IT ON PAPER, 
MUD CAT, JUST IN
TERMS OF 
RECORDS, TEXAS 
38 AND 33, SAN 
DIEGO, 37 AND 
33, BUT THESE 
COULDN'T BE MORE
DIFFERENT TEAMS?
MARK: 
ABSOLUTELY.
PITCH AND GO 
DEFENSE FOR THE 
PADRES, YOU LOOK
AT THE STAFF 
THEY'RE SECOND 
IN THE NATIONAL 
LEAGUE, BUCK 
SHOWALTER'S 
TROOPS, 8TH, 
GIVING UP NEARLY
FIVE RUNS A 
GAME.
TEXAS IS 5TH IN 
DEFENSE IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE,
ALSO.
MATT: HERE IS 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
NOW.
TALK ABOUT 
PADRES HAVING 
GREAT ROAD 
TRIPS.
SWING AND A 
MISS.
ADRIAN WENT DEEP
AGAIN LAST 
NIGHT, 10 ON THE
YEAR, LEADING 
OFF THE SEK.
AND THERE WAS 
LITTLE QUESTION 
THAT THIS WAS 
GOING TO GET 
OUT.
MARK: THAT WAS A
PRETTY SWING.
MATT: EITHER 
YOU'RE PLEASED 
WITH THE 
RESULTS, AND 
GONZALEZ HAS 
BEEN SWINGING 
THE BAT SO WELL 
IN THE MONTH OF 
JUNE, BUT IT'S 
THE SMALL THINGS
THAT LEAD TO THE
GOOD RESULTS 
THAT HAVE BEEN 
PLEASING TO 
BRUCE BOCHY.
MARK: ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT BE 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
TURNING ON THE 
FASTBALL.
YOU KNOW, WE 
KNOW THAT ADRIAN
GONZALEZ, HIS 
STRENGTH IS 
GOING DOWN THE 
LEFT FIELD LINE 
AND SPLITTING 
THE GAP IN LEFT 
CENTER, AND THAT
WAS A GREAT SIGN
LAST NIGHT.
HE GOT A 
FASTBALL, 
MIDDLE, MIDDLE 
IN AND HE TURNED
ON IT.
USUALLY EARL IN 
THE SEASON WHEN 
DE PULL A 
PITCHED BALL?
MATT: BREAKING 
BALL.
MARK: WHEN IT 
WAS A BREAKING 
BALL.
MATT: EVEN ON 
BREAKING BALLS, 
HE WASN'T -- HE 
IS MORE OFTEN 
THAN NOT LOOKING
TO CARVE THAT 
PITCH INTO THE 
OPPOSITE FIELD, 
WHICH IS FINE, 
BUT WHEN YOU 
HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO 
TURN ON A 
BALL -- 
EVERYBODY WAS 
HAPPY TO SEE 
THAT LAST NIGHT.
THERE IS A SWING
AND A MISS TO 
END THE TOP OF 
THE FIRST.
SAN DIEGO IS ON 
THE BOARD, GILES
NOKZ IN A RUN.
1-0 SAN DIEGO.
MATT: 1-NOTHING 
SAN DIEGO AS WE 
GO TO THE HOME 
HALF OF INNING 
NO. 1 AND LOOK 
AT THE RANGERS 
STARTING LINE 
UP.
RICOH BRINGS 
THIS TO YOU.
GARY MATTHEWS, 
YOUNG, MARK 
TEIXEIRA, HANK 
BLALOCK, MARK 
DeROSA, MENCH, 
BRAD WILKERSON, 
KINSLER AND 
GERALD LAIRD 
ROUND THINGS 
OUT.
A NIELT THAT 
CHRIS YOUNG HAS 
LOOKED FORWARD 
TO EVER SINCE HE
LEARN OF THE 
TRADE THAT SENT 
HIM FROM THE 
RANGERS TO THE 
PADRES.
NOBODY HAS BEEN 
BETTER IN TERMS 
OF STARTERS IN 
THE MONTH OF 
JUNE.
CHRIS IS COMING 
OFF A 
NO-DECISION IN A
LOSING EFFORT TO
THE DODGERS, 
MOST RECENTLY 
BUT THAT HARDLY 
BLOCKS WHAT HE 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO
DO OVER THE LAST
FEW STARTS.
MARK: MATTY, 
WE'VE TALKED 
ABOUT THE 
NUMBERS ON THE 
ROAD FOR CHRIS 
YOUNG.
OUTSTANDING.
HE HAS TO STAY 
WITHIN HIMSELF.
HE'S PLAYING 
AGAINST HIS 
FORMER TEAM, 
GUYS GET A 
LITTLE FIRED UP 
TOO MUCH, AND 
THEY START TO 
OVERTHROW TOO 
MUCH, AND 
HOPEFULLY HE CAN
FIND AN EARLY 
GROOVE AND GET 
LOCKED IN, THAT 
TUNNEL VISION TO
WHERE HE IS 
HITTING HIS 
SPOTS AND LOOK 
UP TO WHERE HE'S
DEEP IN THE BALL
GAME.
MATT: GARY 
MATTHEWS, 3-1, 
NOW.
CHRIS ALLOWED A 
COUPLE OF EARNED
YOUNGS IN THAT 
LAST START.
2 EARNED RUNS IN
5 INNINGS OF 
WORK AND THAT 
WAS MORE DAMAGE 
THAN ANYBODY HAD
DONE AGAINST 
CHRIS YOUNG IN 
ABOUT A MONTH.
GARY MATTHEWS 
TAKES A STRIKE 
AND IT'S 3-2, 
FULL COUNT NOW.
HERE IS THE PAY 
OFF HOME.
CHRIS SPENDS A 
LOT OF TIME -- 
HE SPENT A LOT 
OF TIME TODAY 
LOOKING AT VIDEO
OF RANGERS THAT 
HE'S NOT 
NECESSARILY 
FAMILIAR WITH, 
SOME OF THE 
NEWER ADDITIONS 
TO THE LINE UP, 
LIKE IAN 
KINSLER, HERE.
STRIKES OUT GARY
MATTHEWS, 1 
GONE.
THE DEFENSE 
LIKES PLAYING 
BEHIND CHRIS AS 
YOU WORKS FAST 
ON THE MOUND AND
THIS IS A LOOK 
AT THE DEFENSE 
ACTIVE UNIT 
TONIGHT BROUGHT 
TO YOU BY 
OCEAN'S 11 
CASINO.
A SIMILAR LOOK 
AS TO LAST 
NIGHT'S OPENER, 
WITH THE 
EXCEPTIONS BEING
PIAZZA CATCHING 
TODAY, AND E.Y. 
IN LEFT FIELD.
BARFIELD GETS A 
REST.
MARK: HE GETS TO
SPEND SOME TIME 
AT HOME WITH HIS
MOM AND DAD IN 
HOUSTON, 
ENJOYING A BIG 
LEAGUE BALL 
GAME, WATCHING 
THEIR SON PLAY 
SECOND BASE.
ONE GONE FOR 
YOUNG, WHO HAD A
COUPLE OF KNOCKS
YESTERDAY, AND 
YOUNG QUICKLY IN
THE HOLE, 0-2.
STARTS WITH 
ALL-STAR 
NUMBERS, .328 
BATTING AVERAGE 
NUMBERS.
MARK: MATTY, YOU
AND I WERE AT 
THE BALLPARK 
TODAY AND I 
ASKED, WHAT DO 
YOU THINK OF 
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
JUST ONE OF 
THOSE QUESTIONS 
THAT YOU WANT TO
HEAR A GUY 
ELABORATE ON, 
AND HE SAID HE 
LIKES THIS GUY, 
HE HAD HIM ON 
TOUR IN JAPAN, 
THE WHOLE 
PACKAGE.
MATT: HE LIKES 
THE PERSONALITY 
AND THE GUY 
INSIDE THE 
UNIFORM, AS WELL
AS THE NUMBERS.
2-2 THE COUNT.
MARK: THIS MIGHT
BE A CASE OF -- 
I'M NOT GOING TO
PUT WORDS IN 
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
MOUTH, BUT 
FIRST-INNING 
JITTERS, MAYBE 
NOT TRUSTING HIS
STUFF, GOING 
AFTER GUYS HOOR 
HERE EARLY ON.
MATT: IT WAS A 
PITCH COUNT THAT
GOT IN CHRIS 
YOUNG'S WAY 
AGAINST THE 
DODGERS, LAST 
WEEK AT HOME AND
HE WAS ONLY ABLE
TO GO FIVE 
INNINGS IN THAT 
ONE.
IT'S A GAME THAT
THE DODGERS, 
SALVAGED IN THE 
SERIES TO GET 
OUT OF THERE 
WITH ONE WIN.
A SLIDER THAT 
MISSED, 3-2.
MARK: I THINK 
THAT'S BEEN A 
GREAT PITCH FOR 
CHRIS YOUNG THE 
LAST 5, 6, MAYBE
7 STARTS.
BOTH TO RIGHTIES
AND LEFTIES.
MATT: FULL TO 
THE SECOND 
STRAIGHT BATTER 
TO START THE 
BALL GAME.
THAT'S BEEN THE 
DIFFERENCE FOR 
CHRIS IN TERMS 
OF HIS EVOLUTION
FROM A FLY BALL 
PITCHER TO A GUY
THAT CAN PUNCH 
PEOPLE OUT, 
RECORD OUTS ON 
THE GROUND, AND 
THIS IS NOT THE 
GUY THAT THE 
RANGERS WATCHED 
PITCH FOR AN 
ENTIRE YEAR HERE
IN 2005.
MARK: I THINK 
ONE OF THE 
REASONS WHY 
CHRIS YOUNG HAS 
GROWN INTO THE 
PITCHER THAT 
WE'VE SEEN AS A 
PADRE, HE'S 
TRUSTING MORE OF
HIS 4-SEAMER.
REMEMBER, HERE 
IN TEXAS THE 
BALL HAS A 
NDENCY TO FLY.
A LOT OF 
PITCHING COACHES
MIGHT SAY, OH, 
YOU GOT TO GO TO
A TWO-SEAMER, 
WE'VE GOD TO 
WORK GROUNDERS, 
GROUNDERS, 
GROUNDER IS, AND
YOU FORGET ABOUT
THE FACT THAT HE
CAN THROW THE 
BALL 90, 92 
MILE-PER-HOUR.
MATT: SINGLED IN
TO LEFT FIELD.
CURIOUS TO LOOK 
AT THAT AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW IF 
THAT WAS A 
SLIDER THAT HE 
MISSED WITH.
IT WAS A 
FASTBALL.
MARK: YEP.
IT'S GOOD 
LOCATION, THAT'S
ONE OF THOSE 
SITUATIONS WHERE
MICHAEL YOUNG 
HAS TO PROTECT, 
RIGHT?
HE GOES DOWN TO 
GET IT.
HE'S SO FAR BACK
HE HOLDS HIS 
HANDS, THERE, TO
KEEP THEM BACK.
HE FOUND A HOLE 
ON THE LEFT SIDE
THERE FOR A BASE
KNOCK.
MATT: SO A 1-OUT
BATTER AS THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
SECOND STARTS 
OUT IN SIMILAR 
FASHION AS TO 
SAN DIEGO'S 
RUN-SCORING TOP 
OF THE FIRST.
AND NOW MARK 
TEIXEIRA 2 FOR-5
YESTERDAY, 
NUMBERS THAT ARE
DOWN 
SUBSTANTIALLY 
FROM LAST YEAR.
THE 
SWITCH-HITTER 
TEIXEIRA, AND 
THEN THE 
LEFT-HANDED HANK
BLALOCK UP NEXT.
HE DOESN'T GET 
CHEATED UP 
THERE, DOES HE?
A BIG SWING ASK 
A MISS.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE THAT UPPER 
CUT, THAT 
AGGRESSIVE 
SWING.
ONE BALL, NO 
STRIKES, WHAT 
KIND OF A SWING 
ARE YOU GOING TO
TAKE?
OH YEAH!
I LOVE THAT.
HOW MANY PEOPLE 
DID YOU TALK TO 
TODAY, MATTY, 
THAT THOUGHT 
THAT BALL WAS 
FAIR OFF THE BAT
OF TEIXEIRA LAST
NIGHT?
MATT: FUNNY THE 
WAY THAT BROKE 
DOWN, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE AT THE 
BALLPARK THOUGHT
THAT BALL WAS 
FAIR AND OTHERS,
THOSE THAT WORK 
HERE THAT HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN
BASEBALL FOR A 
LONGER TIME, 
LESS KNEE-JERKY,
THEY AGREED WITH
US, THEY DIDN'T 
THINK IT WAS 
ANYTHING BUT 
FOUL FROM THE 
MOMENT IT LEFT 
THE BAT.
MARK: TREVOR 
SAID HE WAS 
SURPRISED THE 
BALL DIDN'T HOOK
MORE THAN IT 
DID.
FROM HIS VANTAGE
POINT HE 
COULDN'T SEE HOW
IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN FAIR.
HE THOUGHT IT 
WAS FOUL.
MATT: YOUNG RUNS
AND TEIXEIRA 
BOUNCES IT TO 
SECOND BASE, 
THEY STAY OUT OF
THE DOUBLE PLAY 
BY STARTING A 
RUNNER, AND THEY
GET TEIXEIRA ON 
A GROUND BALL.
MARK: THAT BALL 
WAS HIT HARD.
IF HE HITS THAT 
BAUM 10 FEET 
EITHER SIDE OF 
JOSH BARFIELD, 
THERE IS A 
CHANCE THAT BALL
SQUEAKS THROUGH.
HE HIT IT HARD, 
BUT YOU KNOW 
WHAT, CHRIS 
YOUNG HIT THE 
SPOT AND MUSER 
ALIGNING THE 
DEFENSE THERE IN
THE INFIELD.
THERE'S TONY 
MUSER.
MATT: SO NOW 
HANK BLALOCK, 49
RUNS BATTED IN 
LEAD THE 
RANGERS, 2 FOR-5
WITH AN RBI 
YESTERDAY, HE'S 
TRYING TO PICK 
UP YOUNG AT 
SECOND BASE WITH
2 GONE, AND HE 
TAKES A STRIKE.
MARK: FIRST 
PITCH BREAKING 
BALL.
PIAZZA WENT OUT 
AND HAD A CHAT 
WITH YOUNG 
BEFORE BLALOCK 
GOT INTO THE 
BOX, AND HE 
SAID, HEY, LET'S
PUT SOMETHING ON
THIS GUY.
MATT: THAT'S 
PART OF THE 
LUXURY OF THE 
3-CATCHER 
EQUATION, IS 
THAT, YOU KNOW, 
BY THE TIME YOU 
GET THROUGH THE 
5 STARTERS, THE 
GUYS IN THE 
BULLPEN, THERE 
IS GOING TO BE A
CATCHER THAT 
EVERYBODY LIKES.
BIG SWING AND A 
MISS.
BOY, THEY ARE UP
THERE HACKING.
MARK: GRIP IT 
AND RIP IT.
YOU SAW MARK 
TEIXEIRA, HANK 
BLALOCK FROM THE
LEFT SIDE, ALSO.
BIG GUY, BIG 
SWING.
ONCE IN A WHILE 
THEY'RE GOING TO
RUN INTO ONE.
MATT: SO NOTHING
AND 2 ON HANK 
BLALOCK, MARK 
DeROSA NEXT.
THE 0-2 PITCH IS
POPPED FOUL, 
THAT WILL BE OUT
OF PLAY.
WHEN WE GOT TO 
THE BALLPARK 
TODAY AND LOOKED
OVER THE 
STARTING LINEUP 
FOR SAN DIEGO, 
YOU NOTICE 
PIAZZA CATCHING 
BECAUSE WE WERE 
ALL UNDER THE 
ASSUMPTION THAT 
HE WAS GOING TO 
D.H. THE ENTIRE 
ROAD TRIP.
BRUCE BOCHY TOLD
US THERE ARE A 
COUPLE OF THINGS
WORKING HERE, 
BARD STILL 
TENDER, AND HE 
HOPES TO HAVE 
BARD TOMORROW, 
BUT HE WANTED 
MIKE CATCHING AT
LEAST ONE DAY ON
THE TRIP SO AS 
NOT TO GET 
COMPLETELY RUSTY
BEHIND THE 
PLATE.
SO A GOOD 
OPPORTUNITY, 
TODAY, WITH BARD
A LITTLE BANGED 
UP, AND BOCH 
WANTING MIKE TO 
GET SOME WORK 
BEHIND THE PLATE
TO HAVE MIKE 
CATCH CHRIS 
YOUNG, AND CHRIS
LIKES WORKING TO
MIKE, TO MAKE IT
EVEN A BETTER 
FIT TONIGHT.
NO SWING BY 
BLALOCK ON THE 
APPEAL, 2-2.
MARK: FIRST BASE
IS OPEN SXUFSHGS
A RIGHT HANDER 
ON DECK, MARK 
DeROSA, YOU 
MIGHT SEE 
ANOTHER BREAKING
BALL HERE, MAYBE
BACK DOOR OR 
DOWN AND IN TO 
BLALOCK.
MATT: [CHUCKLES]
UP AROUND THE 
LIPS.
I'M TELLING YOU 
THESE GUYS DO 
NOT GET CHEATED 
AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S AMAZING, 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE OFFENSIVE 
NUMBERS THE 
RANGERS PUT UP, 
YOU WOULD THINK 
THEY PUNCH OUT 
LIKE FREAKS, YOU
WOULD THINK THEY
WOULD LEAD THE 
LEAGUE IN 
PUNCH-OUTS, NOT 
THE CASE.
THEY'RE AMONG 
TRAILERS, IN 
STRIKEOUTS IN 
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE.
AGGRESSIVE, YET 
DISCIPLINED.
MARK: YEAH.
MATT: IF THERE 
CAN BE SUCH AN 
ANIMAL.
ON 2-2 AGAIN.
AND A DIVE AND A
SMATER BY 
BARFIELD, HERE 
GOING TO WAVE 
YOUNG AROUND.
MARK: TAG HIM, 
TAG HIM, TAG 
HIM, MIKE, GO 
TAG THE RUNNER.
MATT: HOME PLATE
UMPIRE FILLED 
MIKE IN AS HE 
APPLIES THE TAG.
MARK: YES, SIR.
MATT: I WOULD 
LOVE TO BE A FLY
ON THE WALL IN 
THE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN WILKIE 
AND PIAZZA.
TAKE A LOOK AT 
IT AGAIN.
NEVER TOUCHED 
THE PLATE.
HOW DID THAT GO 
AGAIN?
MATT: SOMEBODY 
GET MARK CUBAN 
ON THE PHONE, 
MORE CONTROVERSY
FROM A SPORTS 
TEAM FROM 
DALLAS.
WE'LL LOOK AT IT
AGAIN.
MARK: YOUNG 
THINKS HE TAGS 
THE BACK POINT 
OF HOME PLATE, 
AND QUITE 
HONESTLY, I 
THINK THE PADRES
CATCH A BREAK, 
YOU SEE IT, HIS 
HAND COVERS IT.
MATT: NO, NO, HE
MISSED THE 
PLATE.
YOU'RE BEING A 
REVERSE HOMER.
LOOK, WATCH.
HE MISSES IT, 
MARK.
MARK: NO, I 
THINK HE GOT IT.
MATT: THIS IS 
WHERE IT GETS 
INTERESTING.
PIAZZA, HE 
ASSUMES THAT 
YOUNG TAGGED THE
PLATE.
MEANWHILE 
BELLHORN LEADS 
THINGS OFF AND 
THEN IT GOT FUN.
WHEN MIKE WANTED
TO PUT THE TAG O
WATCH THE MOVE.
THIS IS, AGAIN, 
THE MISSED TAG, 
YOUNG THINKS HE 
TOUCH THE PLATE.
WATCH THE MOVE.
THIS IS FROM 
MIKE'S STREET 
ROOTS PLAYING 
PICKUP 
BASKETBALL.
[CHUCKLES] WHAT 
WAS THAT 
SHOULDER MOVE HE
PUT ON HIM?
MARK: THAT WAS 
FUNNY.
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND A STRIKE, 
THE COUNT TO 
BELLHORN LEADING
THINGS OFF IN 
THE SECOND.
MARK: YOU KNOW, 
WHEN A TEAM IS 
GOING GOOD, YOU 
GET THOSE CALLS,
RIGHT?
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: ONCE 
AGAIN, I THINK 
THE UMPIRE WAS 
BLOCKED.
HE COULDN'T SEE 
WHERE HIS HAND 
WAS TOUCHING 
HOME PLATE.
MATT: UN, AFTER 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
SLID, HE ALMOST 
GAVE HIMSELF UP 
BY TURNING BACK 
TO LOOK AT THE 
UMPIRE.
I THINK.
BELLHORN LINES 
INTO RIGHT.
AND HE STOPS 
AROUND FIRST, 
WISELY SO, AS 
MARK DeROSA GOT 
ON IT QUICKLY.
A LEAD-OFF BASE 
HIT IN THE 
SECOND.
MATT: WATCH 
YOUNG AFTER THE 
PLAY, I'M SAFE, 
RIGHT?
RIGHT?
LITTLE CUP CHECK
THERE, AND 
MARK: AND HE 
KNOWS HE'S GOING
TO BE TAGGED, 
BUT HE'S GOING 
TO TALK TO THE 
UMPIRE, LIKE, 
"DUDE, WHAT'S UP
WITH THAT?"
MATT: I LOVE 
THAT MOVE.
HERE IS KHALIL 
GREENE WITH 
BELLHORN ABOARD.
GREENIE 
YESTERDAY 1-4.
AND A FASTBALL 
STARTS HIM WITH 
A STRIKE.
MARK: THAT'S A 
WAY TO HANG HIM,
MATTY.
MATT: A PAIR OF 
CONTROVERSIAL 
CALLS YESTERDAY 
IN THE 9TH.
WOUN A GROUND 
BALL OUT OFF THE
BAT OF GARY 
MATTHEWS, AND 
THEN, OF COURSE,
THE HOME RUN OR 
FOUL BALL CALL 
THAT WAS 
CONTESTED BY THE
RANGERS.
I THINK THE 
COWBOYS OPEN IN 
JACKSON VILLE 
THIS YEAR AS 
GREENE GROUNDS 
TO THIRD, HANK 
BLALOCK TO IAN 
KINSLER, BACK TO
TEIXEIRA, NO 
CONTROVERSY ON 
THAT ONE, SCORE 
IT 5 TO 4 TO 3 
AND THERE ARE 2 
GONE IN THE 
SECOND.
MARK: PITCHERS 
KNOW WHEN 
THEY'RE ON THE 
MOUND AND YOU 
HAVE GUYS 
STRUGGLING, YOU 
TRY TO THROW 
QUALITY PITCHES 
AND TAKE THE 
STING OUT OF THE
BAT.
HE TRIED TO 
FORCE THAT AND 
PULL THAT BALL, 
KHALIL DID, AND 
HE HIT IT FOR 
THE DOUBLE PLAY.
MATT: SO 2 GONE 
NOW FOR THE RED 
HOT VINNY 
CASTILLA, 3 FOR 
4 YESTERDAY.
WHERE WAS I 
GOING WITH THAT,
YESTERDAY, YOU 
ASKED?
THE COWBOYS, 
OPENING IN 
JACKSON
JACKSON
JACKSON
JACKSONVILLE?
LET'S SEE IF IT.
O. IS INVOLVED 
IN A 
CONTROVERSIAL 
CALL COIN TO SAY
OR SOMETHING.
SO AS WE TALKED 
ABOUT, WHEN WE 
WENT ON THE AIR,
VINNY CASTILLA 
WHO HAS GOTTEN 
RED HOT HERE IN 
JUNE, WE LEARNED
TODAY IN 
SPEAKING WITH 
BRUCE BOCHY THAT
VINNY WAS HOURS 
AWAY FROM 
BECOMING A BENCH
PLAYER.
WHEN HE STARTED 
TO GET HOT AND 
REALLY WHEN 
PEOPLE TOOK 
NOTICE IN 
ANAHEIM, BOCH 
HAD A 
CONVERSATION 
WITH VINNY AND 
TOLD HIM, I GOT 
TO MAKE A 
CHANGE, BELL 
MORE THAN IS 
GOING TO BE OUR 
THIRD BASEMAN, 
AND VINNY SAID, 
WHAT IF I GET A 
COUPLE OF HITS 
TOD
>> 1-NOTHING SAN
DIEGO AS WE GO 
TO THE BOTTOM 
HALF OF INNING 
NO. 2.
CHRIS YOUNG GOES
BACK TO WORK, HE
GETS MARK 
DeROSA, MENCH 
AND BRAD 
WILKERSON AS HE 
GOES TO WORK.
MARK DeROSA HA 
THREE SINGLES IN
YESTERDAY'S 
RANGER LOSS TO 
OPEN THE SERIES.
1 BALL AND 1 
STRIKE.
SUCH A GREAT 
TURNAROUND FOR 
MARK DeROSA THIS
YEAR AS A 
RANGER.
A GOOD PLAYER 
DURING HIS TIME 
IN ATLANTA, BUT 
NEVER WITH THE 
KIND OF NUMBERS 
EVEN CLOSE TO 
WHAT HE'S IN THE
MIDST OF NOW.
DIGGING IN, 
HITTING .343 AS 
YOU SAW A MOMENT
AGO.
MARK DeROSA'S 
PREVIOUS HIGH A 
.297 AVERAGE 
OVER 72 GAMES, 
HIS FIRST REAL 
TASTE OF BIG 
LEAGUE PITCHING 
WITH THE BRAVES 
IN 2002.
BIG HACK AND A 
MISS, 3 BALLS 
AND 2 STRIKES.
MAN!
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT?
THAT'S THE KIND 
OF HACK YOU 
WANT, 3-1.
YOU GET A 
FASTBALL, SURE, 
IT'S OUTER THIRD
AND IT'S UP, 
TRYING TO CARVE 
THAT BALL THE 
OTHER WAY OR 
WHATEVER.
MATT: STRUCK HIM
OUT.
MARK: GOT HIM 
OFF BALL AND OUT
OF THE BOX AFTER
SWINGING OFF 
BALL.
MATT: SECOND OF 
THE GAME FOR 
CHRIS YOUNG.
THE A'S COME TO 
TOWN STARTING 
THE 27TH.
TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY'S 
GAMES ARE AT 
7:05 AND 
THURSDAY'S AT 
12:35, CHECK OUT
PADRES.COM.
MARK: I HERE 
CAMPY HAS BEEN 
SWINGING A HOT 
BAT.
MATT: YEAH, AND 
HE BILLY NORTH 
AT THE TOP OF 
THE A.'S ORDER.
HERE IS MENCH 
NOW, YESTERDAY, 
0 FOR 4.
HE HAS HAD MUCH 
MORE SUCCESS 
WHEN STARTING IN
RIGHT FIELD AS 
OPPOSED TO 
STARTING AT D.H.
MEN
MENCH GETTING 
THE CALL 
TONIGHT, AND -- 
MARK: THIS GUY 
WILL HIT 20 PLUS
HOME RUNS, 
PRETTY MUCH MARK
IT DOWN.
IF HE STAYS 
HEALTHY.
MATT: YOUNG 
BEHIND HIM 3-0.
CHRIS HAS FALLEN
BEHIND NOW 5 OF 
THE FIRST 6 
HITTERS THAT 
HE'S FACED 
TONIGHT.
AND HE LOSES HIS
FIRST OF THE 
BALL GAME, 
THERE'S MENCH, 
WALK NO. 1.
CHRIS WALKED 3 
AGAINST THE 
DODGERS ON 
THURSDAY.
3 WALKS IS HIS 
SEASON HIGH, 
HE'S DONE THAT 
ON A HANDFUL OF 
OCCASIONS THIS 
YEAR.
SO FOR THE 
SECOND STRAIGHT 
INNING THE 
RANGERS HAVE A 
1-OUT BASE 
RUNNER TO WORK 
WITH.
NOW IT'S THE 
LEFT HANDER, 
BRAD WILKERSON.
WILKERSON WAS 
AMONG THOSE THAT
CHRIS YOUNG WAS 
TRYING TO 
FAMILIARIZE 
HIMSELF WITH 
BEFORE THE GAME 
TONIGHT AS BRAD 
WILKERSON IS IN 
HIS FIRST YEAR 
AS A RANGER.
HE AND CHRIS 
WERE NEVER 
TEAMMATES, SO 
THE 13 HOME RUNS
AND WITH A 
STROKE THAT'S A 
BY THE 
UNFAMILIAR TO 
C.Y., CHRIS WAS 
PAYING ATTENTION
TO HIM ON VIDEO 
BEFORE THE GAME.
MISSED THE 
CORNER THERE, 
2-0.
MARK: YOU 
MENTIONED LAST 
NIGHT THAT BRAD 
WILKERSON 
STRIKES OUT A 
LOT, SO A 
PITCHER TAKES 
THAT INTO 
CONSIDERATION.
HE'S FALLEN 
BEHIND, 2-0, 
WILKERSON IS 
SHOWING 
PATIENCE, HERE, 
AND HE KNOWS HE 
WILL CHASE OUT 
OF THE STRIKE 
ZONE, ESPECIALLY
WITH 2 STRIKES.
HE IS GETTING 
THERE QUICKLY.
MATT: OUT OF 
STRETCH WITH 
MENCH ABOARD.
A SWING AND A 
HIGH FLY BALL 
INTO RIGHT FIELD
FOR GILES.
THAT'S OUT NO. 
2.
FIRST TIME 
THROUGH THE 
ORDER, AND THE 
RANGERS ARE 
TAKING SOME BIG 
SWINGS AGAINST 
CHRIS YOUNG 
TONIGHT.
MARK: AND, YOU 
KNOW, HERE AT 
ARLINGTON, THE 
FLIES ARE GOING 
STRAIGHT IN WITH
SOME AUTHORITY.
YOU WOULD THINK 
BY THESE HACKS, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
WIND HERE AT THE
BALLPARK, BE WAW -- 
BEWARE FOR THE 
WIND AT THE 
BALLPARK AND 
HANG ONTO YOUR 
HAT.
MATT: THERE'S A 
STRIKE TO START 
THE AT-BAT WITH 
IAN KINSLER.
CHRIS HAS THROWN
42
42 PITCHES AND 
BE NOT YET 
COMPLETED WITH 2
INNINGS.
THAT PITCH COUNT
MAY STAND IN THE
WAY OF A LONG 
START.
MARK: HE NEEDS A
6 OR 8-PITCH 
INNING.
MATT: BULLPEN 
GOT A LOT OF 
WORK YESTERDAY, 
AND FOR SAN 
DIEGO, AFTER THE
DAY OFF MONDAY, 
A WE WILL-RESTED
BULLPEN WAS 
UTILIZED.
5 GUYS PITCHED 
AFTER THE 
STARTER 
YESTERDAY.
MARK: BOCH TODAY
IN THE OFFICE 
SAID EVERYONE IS
GOOD TO GO.
AFTER HIS 900TH 
WIN LAST NIGHT.
WALKED INTO HIS 
OFFICE, THERE 
WAS A BASEBALL 
SITTING ON HIS 
DESK.
TREVOR HOFFMAN, 
WHO USUALLY 
KEEPS HIS SAVE 
BALLS, HE 
COLLECTS THEM, 
EACH AND EVERY 
SAVE?
AFTER THAT BALL 
GAME, TREVOR 
HOFFMAN MARKED 
IT UP WITH 900TH
VICTORY AND 
PRESENTED IT TO 
MANAGER BRUCE 
BOCHY.
MATT: THAT'S 
NEAT.
MARK: VERY NICE.
BOCH WAS VERY 
IMPRESSED.
MATT: TELL YOU, 
I MEAN, TREVOR 
IS VERY MUCH 
AWARE THAT HE 
HAS BOCH TO 
THANK FOR A LOT 
OF HIS CAREER 
SUCCESS.
MENCH RUNS.
IT'S LINED INTO 
THE SEATS FOUL.
TREVOR COMING 
OFF INJURY AND 
BOCH HAVING ALL 
THE CONFIDENCE 
IN THE WORLD IN 
HIS CLOSER.
YOU KNOW, WHAT 
TOTALS GET TO BE
AT THE POINT 
WHERE TREVOR'S 
ARE, THERE HAS 
TO BE A 
RELATIONSHIP 
WITH MANAGERS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE THAT 
MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES IF
MANAGERS AREN'T 
CONFIDENT IN 
YOU.
BIG SWING ASK A 
FOUL BALL.
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT, TREVOR GOT
THE SAVE LAST 
NIGHT, FOR HIS 
17TH, AND THAT'S
GOOD NEWS FROM 
THE SKIPPER THAT
HE'S GOOD TO GO 
AGAIN TONIGHT.
GAVE UP A HIT 
LAST NIGHT AND 
THAT WAS IT.
MATT: THE 
ANGLES, BEAT THE
GIANTS EARLIER 
THIS AND A 
COUPLE OF OTHER 
GAMES BEGIN 
SHORTLY, SEATTLE
AT L.A., ONE OF 
THOSE.
WE'LL CONTINUE 
TO KEEP OUR EYES
ON THOSE.
BY MY UNOFFICIAL
COUNT THIS IS 
THE 4TH FULL 
COUNT AGAINST 
CHRIS YOUNG IN 8
BATTERS FACED.
MENCH RUNS ON 
3-2 AND IT'S 
FOULED BACK.
MARK: HE'S GOING
TO THROW 50 
PITCHES IN 2 
INNINGS.
MATT: AND SHUT 
OUT INNINGS.
MARK: I WAS 
GOING TO SAY 
FROM AN 
OFFENSIVE 
STANDPOINT FROM 
TEXAS I HAVEN'T 
SEEN ONE GUY TRY
TO CARVE THE 
BALL THE 
OPPOSITE WAY.
EVEN WITH THE 
RUNNER GOING 
RIGHT THERE, 2 
OUTS.
YOU KNOW?
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS, STRIKE 
3, NO CARVING 
TONIGHT.
3 PUNCH-OUTS BY 
THE EX-RANGER.
MATT: TAKE A 
GUIDED BEHIND 
THE SCENES TOUR 
OF PETCO PARK, 
OFFERED ON 
SUNDAYS
SUNDAY TUESDAY 
THROUGH SUNDAYS,
VISIT 
PADRES.COM.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
GOES BACK TO 
WORK, 1-NOTHING 
FRIARS, AND JOSH
BARFIELD HAS 
BEEN SITTING 
AROUND WATCHING 
THESE BIG HACKS 
AND SAYS "I WANT
ME UN."
MARK: DO YOU 
THINK IT'S 
PSYCHOLOGICAL, 
SOME GUYS SEE 
THAT AND GET UP 
THERE AND GET 
FROGGY?
DO YOU THINK IT 
CARRIES OVER A 
LITTLE ABOUT?
MATT: WHY NOT?
SURE.
JOSH BEHIND, 
0-2.
BALL AND 2 
STRIKES TO JOSH 
BARFIELD.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
KNOWS WHAT IT'S 
LIKE TO MAKE 
GUYS SWING AND 
MISS.
HE HAS STRUCK 
OUT 66 ON THE 
YEAR, ONLY 17 
WALKS AND HE 
ANNUALLY HAS 
GOOD STRIKEOUT 
TO WALK NUMBERS.
MISSES HIGH 
AGAIN, SO 2-2 
NOW AFTER BEING 
BEHIND NOTHING 
AND 2 TO 
BARFIELD.
LAST YEAR KEVIN 
MILLWOOD WON 
ONLY 9 GAMES AND
I SAY "ONLY" 
BECAUSE HE LED 
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE IN 
E.R.A., .2E.R.A.E.E.R.A.
E.R.A., 2.86.
HE IS AN ACTIVE 
BIG LEAGUER TO 
HAVE 
ACCOMPLISHED 
THAT AREAEST OF 
HITTING
HIT FETING FEATS, 
NO-HITTERS, BACK
IN PHILLY.
IT'S INCREDIBLE,
THERE HAVE BEEN 
NO NO-HITTERS, 
JOHNSON'S '04 
BEING THE MOST 
RECENT.
MARK: REALLY?
MATT: YEAH.
ACCORDING TO 
"CHYRON BOB" 
WEHRSDORFER.
YOUNG THROWING 
TO FIRST TO 
RETIRE ERIC 
YOUNG BY A STEP.
IT'S THE SECOND 
TIME E.Y. HAS 
GROUNDED OUT TO 
HIS NAME SAKE 
AND ON THAT 
OCCASION IT WAS 
VERY CLOSE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE HOW MICHAEL 
YOUNG, THE 
SHORTSTOP, ONCE 
HE GETS THIS 
BASEBALL, AND 
THEN HE KNOWS HE
HAS TO GEAR UP 
THE ARM, LOAD UP
THAT HOSE, BANG!
GOT HIM BY WHAT,
MAYBE A FOOT?
THAT'S A NICE 
PLAY.
MATT: SO NOW 
MIKE CAMERON 
WITH 2 GONE AND 
THE BASES EMPTY.
YOU KNOW HOW 
WHENEVER A GUY 
THROWS A 
NO-HITTER ON 
THAT RARE 
OCCASION, IT 
GIVES THE STATS 
PEOPLE THE 
NUMEROLOGIST, 
THE TRIVIA 
FANATIC 
PARTICULARSES
PARTICULARS -- 
FANATIC 
PARTICULARS, 
THEY SINK THEIR 
TEETH INTO IT.
MATT: THE LAST 3
PITCHERS, TO 
NO-HIT THE 
GIANTS, ALL 
NAMED KEVIN.
KEVIN BROWN, 
KEVIN MILLWOOD, 
AND KEVIN 
JOHNSON.
BOTH OF THEM 
AGAINST THE 
GIANTS.
TERRY 
MULLHOLLAND DID 
THE FIRST.
THAT'S THAT 
JASON STARK 
STUFF THAT COMES
OUT THAT WE, 
FRANKLY LOVE.
MARK: IT'S GOOD 
STUFF.
DOES HE LABEL 
THAT AS USELESS 
INFORMATION?
MATT: THAT'S 
RIGHT.
MARK: IT'S GOOD 
STUFF.
MATT: SAN DIEGO 
SCORING ON AN 
RBI BY GILES IN 
THE FIRST.
MARK: CHRIS 
YOUNG HAS 
PITCHED WELL, 
BECAUSE KEVIN 
MILLWOOD WHEN 
HE'S OUT THERE 
STARTING FOR 
TEXAS HE IS 
GETTING 5 AND A 
HALF RUNS OF 
SUPPORT, SO 
FIRST TIME 
THROUGH THE LINE
UP, LOOKS LIKE 
CHRIS YOUNG HAS 
DONE EXTREMELY 
WELL.
MATT: FULL COUNT
NOW, 3-2.
TALKING ABOUT 
THE DEAL THAT 
BROUGHT MILLWOOD
OVER FROM 
CLEVELAND IN THE
OFF-SEASON, 
RANGERS WERE 
THRILLED TO BE 
ABLE TO POACH 
THE REIGNING REIGNER REIGN LEADER
IN THE FIELD.
MARK: BEAUTIFUL 
APPROACH.
TALKING ABOUT 
MAKING 
ADJUSTMENTS, 
OPPOSITE SIDE OF
THE PLATE, NOT A
LOT OF UPPER 
BODY MOVEMENT, 
HE JUST THREW 
THE HANDS THAT 
WAY.
WE'VE SEEN HIM A
FEW THEMS THIS 
ROAD TRIP GOING 
TO RIGHT CENTER 
FIELD AND TO 
RIGHT CENTER 
SAFELY.
MATT: SO NOW 
BRIAN GILES WITH
A RUNNER ABOARD.
SEE IF CAMERON 
LOOKS TO STEAL A
BASE HERE.
MIKE, AFTER 
BEING HIT BY A 
PITCH ADVANCED 
ON A WILD PITCH 
IN THE FIRST.
CAMERON HAS ONLY
BEEN THROWN OUT 
ONCE ALL YEAR 
AND THAT WAS 
SATURDAY IN 
ANAHEIM.
GILES IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE GAMES ONLY 
RUN THIS FAR 
WITH AN RBI 
DOUBLE AND THAT 
HIT LIKE A SHOT 
A FAIR BALL INTO
THE RIGHT FIELD 
CORNER, CAMERON 
TO THIRD.
THAT BALL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY 
SMOKED.
GILES HAS A 
LAUGH ABOUT IT.
MARK: JUST OUT 
OF THE REACH OF 
TEIXEIRA, AND 
NEARLY HITTING 
FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE TIM 
MCLELLAN.
A 2-OUT KNOCK 
FOR THE FRIARS.
THAT'S A 
DANGEROUS AREA 
WHEN YOU THROW 
THAT BREAKING 
BALL DOWN AND 
INTO THE 
LEFTIES, THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR IT.
MATT: SO NOW BIG
OPPORTUNITY FOR 
PIAZZA, RUNNERS 
AT THE CORNERS 
WITH 2 GONE.
MIKE BOUNCED OUT
TO SHORTSTOP IN 
HIS FIRST TRY 
TONIGHT.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
VERY QUIETLY HAS
AMASSED A RATHER
HIGH PITCH 
COUNT.
BOUNCED TO HANK 
BLALOCK AND 
MILLWOOD WILL 
ESCAPE THIS JAM.
NOTHING COMES OF
BACK-TO-BACK 
TWO-OUT SINGLES,
1-NOTHING SAN 
DIEGO.
MATT: WE GO TO 
THE BOTTOM HALF 
OF INNING NO. 3 
AND TAKE A LOOK 
AT OUR ESURANCE 
COMPARISON OF 
THE GAME 
TONIGHT.
QUOTE AND 
COMPARE 
INSTANTLY AT 
ESURANCE.COM.
TAKE A LOOK AT 
THE NUMBERS OF 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA.
IT'S A SURPRISE 
THAT ADRIAN IS 
OUTSLUGGING AND 
OUTHOMERING A 
GUY THAT BEAT UP
ON THE BIG 
LEAGUES LAST 
YEAR.
MARK: YEAH, HE 
SPLIT TIME BEING
HURT IN TEXAS 
AND 38 HOME 
RUNS.
TEIXEIRA PROVED 
HE CAN PUT UP 
SERIOUS 
NUMBERS -- OH MY
GOSH, WHAT 
HAPPENED THERE?
MATT: GOT IN THE
WIND AND ADRIAN 
DIDN'T HAVE A 
PLAY ON IT.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
TO GERALD LAIRD,
YOU'LL HAVE 
ANOTHER CHANCE 
IN AN 0-1 COUNT.
MARK: ADRIAN 
ANTICIPATED THAT
BALL BEING HIT A
LITTLE FARTHER.
HE NEEDS TO GO 
DOWN A BY THE TO
GET THAT BALL UP
TO ADRIAN.
MATT: POPPED IT 
UP AGAIN.
SEE WHAT THE 
WIND DOES TO 
THIS BALL.
BARFIELD HANGS 
WITH IT TO MAKE 
THE CATCH.
MARK: TELL YOU 
WHAT, THIS IS 
CANDLESTICK-LIKE
, HUH?
HAVE TO KEEP 
YOUR FEET 
MOVING.
MATT: WE TALKED 
ABOUT IT 
YESTERDAY.
IT SEEMS TO 
CHANGE 
DIRECTIONS NOT 
BY THE INNING, 
NOT BY THE 
AT-BAT, BUT BY 
THE PITCH.
HERE IS GARY 
MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR, NOW, 
STRUCK OUT IN 
THE FIRST.
YOU KNOW, JASON 
STARKS-TYPE 
STUFF, YOU TALK 
ABOUT GARY 
MATTHEWS AND HIS
FATHER, SENIOR, 
THEY TALK ABOUT 
JUNIOR, SON OF OF 
SENIOR.
JERRY
ENGINEER JERRY 
HAIRSTON IS 
HERE, SON OF 
JERRY SENIOR AND
GRANDSON OF 
JERRY.
CHET LEMON -- AS
THAT BALL IS 
FOULED AWAY, THE
GREAT TIGER AND 
WHITE SOX, HIS 
SON MARCUS WAS 
THE RANGERS'S 
FOURTH-ROUND 
PICK THIS PAST 
JUNE, A COUPLE 
WEEKS AGO.
IF YOU GET INTO 
A TIME CAPSULE 
FOR A FEW YEARS 
AND GOT OUT OF 
IT AND YOU SAW 
LEMON, MAYBERRY,
JERRY HAIRSTON 
AND GARY 
MATTHEWS, YOU 
WOULD THINK 
THOSE GUYS WERE 
HAVING 
INCREDIBLE 
CAREERS INTO 
THEIR 50s.
2 BALLS, 2 
STRIKES TO GARY.
GOT 'EM 
SWINGING.
MARK: YOU THINK 
THIS TEAM SYSTEM
A HIGH, 
FASTBALL-HITTING
TEAM?
YOU BET.
RIGHT AT THE 
LETTERS, JUNIOR 
HAS TO PROTECT.
MATT: THAT'S THE
FIRST STRIKEOUT 
FOR CHRIS THAT 
HASN'T COME IN A
FULL-BLOWN HACK.
MARK: I WAS JUST
GOING TO SAY 
THAT. THAT'S 
THE FIRST 
DEFENSIVE SWING 
I THINK TONIGHT 
BY THE RANGERS.
MATT: SO NOW 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
WITH 2 GONE.
MARK: NICE.
MATT: 1-1.
CHRIS IS EN 
ROUTE TO WHAT 
WOULD BE HIS 
LOWEST PITCH 
COUNT INNING.
THAT WAS PITCH 
NO. 12 HERE IN 
THE THIRD.
MARK: WHAT ELSE 
DO YOU NOTICE 
ABOUT WHY UNG 
YOUNG SECOND 
TIME AROUND 
AGAINST THESE 
RANGERS?
ONE THING I 
NOTICE HE'S 
THROWING MORE 
SLIDERS, AND 
DROPPING THE 
HAMMER A LITTLE 
MORE, ALSO.
TAKE A LOOK AT 
THE BREAKDOWN, 
61 PITCHES, 62.
SLIDER ON THE 
HALF SHELL 
MATT: THAT'S THE
WEAPON NOW IN 
CHRIS' ARSENOL 
THAT HE DIDN'T 
HAVE AS A 
RANGER, SO YOU 
CAN UNDERSTAND 
IF THE RANGERS 
ARE CONFUSED BY 
THAT.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE THE FRONT 
SIDE OPEN UP ON 
YOUNG, THERE?
MATT: THE 2-2.
UP AND IN WITH A
FASTBALL, FULL 
COUNT, NOW.
VERY FINE LINE 
BETWEEN TRYING 
TO OUTTHINK YOUR
OPPONENT AND 
OUTTHINKING 
YOURSELF, AND 
CHRIS SEEMS TO 
HAVE WALKED THAT
LINE WELL 
TONIGHT.
MARK: HE HAS TO 
BE SHORT AND 
QUICK, FOR THE 
HITTER.
AND HE WAS ON 
THAT FASTBALL 
INSIDE.
MATT: ALMOST GOT
IT UP TO THE HER
MET
HERMETICALLY-
SEALED WINDOW, 
UP HERE TONIGHT.
THEY ONLY OPEN 
IT UP FOR FOOD, 
THEN THEY'LL 
CRANK IT OUT 
REAL FAST.
2-2 TO MARK 
TEIXEIRA.
TO YOUNG, 
RATHER.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
STANDING ON DECK
NEXT.
NO TV TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON.
THIS ROAD TRIP 
CONCLUDES WITH 
AN 11 A.M. SAN 
DIEGO START TIME
TOMORROW EXAMINE
THEN BACK HOME 
FOR THE MARINERS
ON FRIDAY.
THIS WAS GOING 
TO BE CHRIS 
YOUNG'S QUICKEST
PITCH COUNT 
INNING.
THIS WILL BE THE
9TH PITCH OF THE
AT-BAT ON ITS 
WAY TO MICHAEL 
YOUNG.
IN THE AIR AND 
SLICING INTO THE
CORNER.
OUT OF PLAY.
MARK: THAT BALL 
WASN'T FAR FROM 
STAYING FAIR AND
HITTING THAT 
FAIR POLE OUT 
THERE.
MATT: YOU KNOW, 
THE ANGLE WE SEE
DOWN THERE, WE 
SEE THE CORNER 
IT CUTS AND IT 
SAYS 349 AND AS 
YOU MENTIONED, 
THERE IS A 
PADDING THERE 
AND THE WALL 
SHOOTS IN A 
LITTLE BIT.
THE WAY THE 
BALLS TRAVEL 
RIGHT FIELD IN 
THE SERIES, IT 
ALMOST SEEMS 
LIKE IT'S 330 
DOWN THERE.
TRY IT AGAIN.
LINED TO THIRD 
AND VINNY GOB 
BELLS IT UP FOR 
THE FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
YOUNG GETS THE 
RANGERS IN 
ORDER, STILL 1-0
SAN DIEGO.
MATT: 1-NOTHING 
SAN DIEGO AS WE 
GO TO THE TOP 
HALF OF INNING 
NO. 4 BACK WITH 
MARK GRANT, MATT
VASGERSIAN, 
PADRES SCORING A
RUN IN THE 
FIRST, AND THAT 
LEAD HAS HELD SO
FAR FOR CHRIS 
YOUNG.
HERE IS ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ LEADING
THINGS OFF IN 
THE VISITORS' 
FOURTH.
YOU KNOW, WE 
WERE TALKING 
TODAY WITH OUR 
ASSOCIATE 
PRODUCER "CHYRON
BOB" 
WEHRSDORFER, AS 
WE STARTED 
RUNNING DOWN 
ACTIVE BIG 
LEAGUERS, FROM 
SAN DIEGO.
WE STARTED TO 
THINKING ABOUT 
THAT'S A GOOD 
TEAM YOU COULD 
PUT TOGETHER.
AS GONZALEZ 
SPRAYS TO CENTER
FIELD FOR 
MATTHEWS.
AND DOING IT OFF
THE TOP OF YOUR 
HEAD AS "CHYRON 
BOB" WEHRSDORFER
DID IN ABOUT 3 
MINUTES, THIS 
ISN'T EVERYBODY 
BUT THIS IS THE 
KIND OF TEAM YOU
COULD PUT 
TOGETHER IF YOU 
WANT TO TAKE 
GUYS WHO HAVE 
THEIR ROOTS IN 
SAN DIEGO AND 
PUT THEM ON THE 
FIELD TOGETHER.
FIRST OF ALL 
IT'S A HECK OF A
STAFF, PRIOR AND
HARANG, THIRD 
BASE WE PUT 
PEREZ THERE BUT 
YOU COULD PUT 
HANK BLALOCK ON 
THERE, TOO.
MARK: SURE.
MATT: WE HEAR A 
LOT, ESPECIALLY 
WHEN YOU COME TO
TEXAS, OF TEXANS
IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES.
YOU KNOW, 
YESTERDAY 
JENNINGS SHUT 
OUT THE A. 
SXAESHGS THEY 
STARTED OFF BY 
SAYING, BAYLOR 
GRAD AND SUCH 
AND SUCH HIGH 
SCHOOL, JASON 
JENNINGS SHUTS 
OUT THE A.'S.
MARK: HOW ABOUT 
DARREN BALSLEY 
LEADING THE 
PITCHING STAFF 
AS COACH.
MATT: SURE.
STRIKE TO 
BELLHORN TO MAKE
IT 1-2.
HOW ABOUT THE 
COACH, JOHN 
CATERRA?
MARK: NICE.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS, 
STRIKEOUT FOR 
MILLWOOD.
THIRD OF THE 
GAME FOR HIM.
LET'S TAKE A 
LOOK AT OUR 
AFLAC TRIVIA 
QUESTION TONIGHT
AS WE CONTINUE 
TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE
FACT THAT WE'VE 
GOT SOME RANGER 
HISTORY TO 
DISCUSS, A 
UNIFORM WE DON'T
SEE OFTEN 
THROUGH THE 
COURSE OF THE 
REGULAR SEASON.
TONIGHT WE ASK 
"WHICH RANGER 
PITCHER STARTED 
A GAME 22 DAYS 
AFTER BEING THE 
CLUB'S FIRST 
ROUNDER IN 
1973?"
HERE IS KHALIL 
GREENE.
SPEAKING OF 
FIRST-ROUNDERS, 
A FLY BALL TO 
RIGHT FOR MARK 
DeROSA.
IT'S THE 
QUICKEST OF 1, 
2, 3 INNINGS FOR
KEVIN MILLWOOD.
MATT: 1-NOTHING 
SAN DIEGO, WE GO
TO THE BOTTOM 
HALF OF THE 4TH 
AND ANSWER THE 
AFLAC TRIVIA 
QUESTION.
THE PITCHER THAT
STARTED THE GAME
HERE FOR THE 
RANGERS 22 DAYS 
OFF BEING A 
FIRST-ROUND 
CHOICE IN WEIGH 
73, DAVID CLYDE,
A TEXAN, HOUSTON
NATIVE, AND THEN
BOB SHORT 
ORDERED 
MANAGEMENT TO 
DRAFT HIM BUT 
PUT HIM RIGHT IN
THE BIG LEAGUES,
AND HE THOUGHT 
HE WAS A GENIUS 
AFTER CLYDE WON 
A FEW GAMES, 
PACKED A FEW 
HOUSES, BUT THE 
STORY DID NOT 
HAVE A HAPPY 
ENDING, 
NECESSARILY, HE 
PITCHED HERE FOR
THREE YEARS AND 
HE WAS DONE.
YOU TALK ABOUT 
RUSHING A GUY, 
THAT BECAME A 
VERB, TO DAVID 
CLYDE SOMEBODY 
WAS TO RUSH 
SOMEBODY TO THE 
BIG LEAGUES.
MARK: I REMEMBER
HEARING STORIES 
OF HIM THROWING 
140, 150 PITCHES
A GAME, THEY 
JUST LEFT HIM 
OUT THERE.
MATT: THE 
CONSENSUS 
OPINION BY THE 
BASEBALL PEOPLE 
WAS HE WASN'T 
READY, BUT OWNER
WANTED A 
PROMOTIONAL POP,
AND THEY BLEW 
THE KID OUT.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
LEADS THINGS OFF
IN THE 4TH, 
TEIXEIRA, 
BLALOCK AND MARK
DeROSA FOR THE 
RANGERS.
THOSE EARL DAYS 
OF THE RANGERS 
ARE CHRONICLED 
IN WHAT IS STILL
ONE OF MY 
PERSONAL 
FAVORITE 
BASEBALL BOOKS 
EVER WRITTEN AND
I'M REMISS FOR 
NOT RECALLING 
THE NAME OF THE 
AUTHOR, BUT HE 
WAS A FORMER 
BEAT WRITER THAT
FOLLOWED THE 
RANGERS IN THEIR
EARLY DAYS WHEN 
THEY CAME HERE 
FROM WASHINGTON 
AND RELOCATED AS
THE SENATORS TO 
THE RANGERS, THE
NAME OF THE BOOK
IS CALLED 
"SEASONS IN 
HELL" AND IT 
DOCUMENTS THE 
FIRST TWO YEARS 
OF RANGERS 
HISTORY REPLETE 
WITH STORIES OF 
GUYS BABYINGING 
CURFEW AND ALL 
THAT FUN, OFF 
THE FIELD STUFF 
THAT WE'VE COME 
TO EXPECT IN 
SPORTS STUFF.
SWING AND A MISS
FOR TEIXEIRA, 
AND THAT'S 
STRIKEOUT NO. 5 
FOR CHRIS YOUNG 
TONIGHT.
MARK: HOW WAS HE
GOING TO MISS 
THAT?
THAT'S A GOOD 
FASTBALL DOWN 
THE MIDDLE OF 
THE PLATE.
YOU CAN GET HURT
THERE MANY 
TIMES.
NOT THAT TIME.
MATT: SO NOW 
HANK BLALOCK, 2 
FOR 5 YESTERDAY,
AND HE'S SINGLED
TONIGHT.
USE USED TO 
IMITATE TONY 
GWYNN AS A KID.
HANK HAS SAID HE
WAS NEVER A BIG 
GUY GROWING UP, 
AND HE'S FILLED 
OUT AS A MAJOR 
LEAGUER, BUT AS 
A SMALL GUY THAT
WASN'T ABLE TO 
GRIP IT AND RIP 
IT, HE LEARNED 
HOW TO CARVE AND
HIT LIKE TONY 
GWYNN.
INTO LEFT 
CENTER, CAMERON 
CALLING OFF 
YOUNG TO MAKE 
THE CATCH.
MARK: THERE WE 
GOT CHANNEL 4 
FANS, MATTY.
MATT: THAT 
CLEARLY GOT THE 
CHECK YESTERDAY,
THAT GUY.
MARK: THE AKIMAS
THAT LIVE IN 
TEXAS, FAMILY 
LIVES IN 
OCEANSIDE.
I GOT THE LETTER
RIGHT HERE, HI 
FROM BETH 
MARSHALL, YOU 
PEOPLE OUT IN 
OCEANSIDE.
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THAT, 
MATTY?
MATT: THINK IT'S
GREAT.
HERE IS MARK 
DeROSA NOW WITH 
2 GONE.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT
OF PADRE FANS 
HERE IN THIS 
SERIES.
MARK: DID YOU 
GET YOUR LETTERS
SENT YOUR WAY?
MATT: NO.
IT'S OKAY.
MARK: I DIDN'T 
THINK SO.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND NO STRIKES 
THE COUNT TO 
MARK DeROSA.
MATT: INTO RIGHT
CENTER, CAMERON 
HAS TO MOVE AND 
IT GETS UP AND 
OVER HIS HEAD, 
MARK DeROSA 
ROUNDING INTO 
SECOND BASE.
HAVING A HECK OF
A SERIES, HERE.
INCH YOU KNOW, 
WE'VE TALKED 
ABOUT HOW THE 
BALL TRAVELS 
HERE IN RIGHT 
CENTER FIELD.
IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE ROUTE FOR 
MIKE CAMERON, I 
DON'T THINK HE 
ANTICIPATED THAT
BALL GOING OVER 
HIS HEAD.
HE THOUGHT HE 
HAD A BEAD ON 
THAT, AND THAT 
BALL WAS HIT 
HARDER THAN MIKE
THOUGHT.
YOU CAN SEE MIKE
SMILING THERE 
AND SHAKING HIS 
HEAD.
MATT: TAKE A 
LOOK AT THE 
SWING BY MARK 
DeROSA, AND 
WATCH HOW SOFT 
HE IS ON THE 
FRONT FOOT.
KEPT ALL OF HIS 
WEIGHT BACK 
THERE AND THOSE 
ARE AMONG THE 
ADJUSTMENTS THAT
HE HAS MADE WITH
RUDY JARAMILLO, 
THE FINE BATTING BATTING BATTING
INSTRUCTOR HERE.
THE RANGERS ARE 
PROUD OF WHAT 
HE'S 
ACCOMPLISHED.
MARK: THE HARD 
LANDING MESSES 
EVERYTHING ELSE 
ON YOUR BODY, 
MATTY.
MATT: NOTHING-1 
THE COUNT TO 
MENCH.
APPARENTLY MARK 
DeROSA USED TO 
DIVE A LOT.
AND HE WOULD GET
CAUGHT OUT HIS 
FRONT FOOT AND 
THAT WOULD MAKE 
HIM VULNERABLE 
INSIDE AND 
PITCHERS WOULD 
FIND IT EASY TO 
BUST HIM IN, AND
THE RESULTS ARE 
GREAT, HITTING 
.345.
MENCH SLICES A 
FLY BALL INTO 
THE RIGHT FIELD 
CORNER.
1-2.
MENCH LINES UP 
THE MIDDLE, AND 
HERE COMES MARK 
DeROSA WITH THE 
TYING STRIKE.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MATT: A 2-OUT 
RANGER RALLY 
EVENS THE SCORE 
AT 1 APIECE.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
MARK DeROSA AND 
MENCH AND THEIR 
APPROACH THE 
LAST TIME UP 
JUST SHORTENED 
UP A LITTLE BIT.
THIS BALL IS A 
HIGH, HANGING 
CUTTER OR A 
SLIDER, AND YOU 
CAN SEE YOU 
CAN'T TAKE THAT 
BIG HACK.
HE CUT BACK, AND
BOTH GUYS CUT 
BACK ON THEIR 
APPROACH.
MATT: THE INNING
STARTED OUT 
INNOCENTLY 
ENOUGH, HANK 
BLALOCK LINED 
OUT, MARK 
TEIXEIRA LINED 
OUT, THAT WAS 7 
IN A ROW, THEN 
MARK DeROSA'S 
DOUBLE, MENCH 
SINGLES HIM HOME
AND WE'RE BACK 
AT 1 APIECE.
0-1 TO BRAD 
WILKERSON.
A BIG SWING ASK 
A MISS THERE.
NOTHING-2.
BRAD WILKERSON 
WILL PUNCH OUT.
HE LEADS BIG 
LEAGUE BASEBALL 
WITH 84 
STRIKEOUTS ON 
THE YEAR.
AND HE IAN 
KINSLER IAN 
KINSLER THE 
SECOND BASEMAN, 
NEXT.
THAT WAS THE 
KIND OF PITCH 
YOU THROW WHAT 
YOU WANT A NEW 
BASEBALL, AND 
YOU CALL TIME.
MARK: I'M 
SURPRISED THEY 
CALLED A 
PITCH-OUTRIGHT 
THERE.
MATT: MENCH 
RUNS, THEY 
SMELLED 
SOMETHING BUT IT
DOESN'T MATTER 
AS BRAD 
WILKERSON SWINGS
AND MISSES, IT'S
STRIKE 3.
MARK: THAT'S WHY
BECAUSE HE'S 
VULNERABLE TO 
THE STRIKEOUT.
MATT: RANGERS 
TIE IT.
NOT TOO CLOSE; WHATTA YA' THINK
I GOT THAT INSURANCE ?
WHAT INSURANCE
IS THAT YOGI ?
AFLAC.
[ Duck grunts ]
THE ONE YA' REALLY
NEED TO HAVE...
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED IT.
NEED WHAT ?
AFLAC.
WELL, IF YOU GET HURT
AND MISS WORK IT WON'T HURT
TO MISS WORK.
HUH ?
AND THEY GIVE YA' CASH
WHICH IS JUST AS GOOD AS MONEY.
AFLAC.
ASK ABOUT IT AT WORK.
[ Duck grunts ]
MATT: YOUR 
VIEJAS MID GAME 
RECAP, A 1-1 
DRAW THROUGH 4, 
TOP OF THE 5TH, 
AND VINNY 
CASTILLA, 
SWINGING THROUGH
MILLWOOD.
MARK: GOOD 
OLD-FASHIONED 
PITCHERS' DUAL, 
IN A BALLPARK 
WHERE THE BALL 
FLIES, AND CHRIS
YOUNG PITCHING 
WELL ON THE 
ROAD, AND KEVIN 
MILLWOOD, WHO IS
STRUGGLING AT 
HOME.
MATT: NOT THE 
CASE TONIGHT.
1 GONE FOR JOSH 
BARFIELD.
THERE'S A KNOCK 
BACK UP THE 
MIDDLE.
MATT: KEVIN 
MILLWOOD WITH 
8-3, AND 3-3 
WITH A 6.65 
E.R.A. HERE AT 
HOME AND FOR THE
GUY THAT'S IN 
THE FIRST YEAR 
OF A 4-YEAR, 
NEARLY $50 
MILLION DEAL, I 
THINK THAT'S A 
BUSINESS 
DISCONCERTING 
FOR THE RANGERS.
MARK: 
ABSOLUTELY.
HE WAS GETTING 5
AND A HALF RUNS 
OF SUPPORT EACH 
START, AND ONE 
OF HIS PITCHES 
IN HIS REP
IN LINE UP, IS A
CUTTING SLIDER, 
AND HE LEARNED 
THAT FROM 
MADDUX.
MATT: E.Y.'S JAM
ROLLED OUT TO 
YOUNG.
MICHAEL HAS 
REALLY MADE 
ERIC'S NIGHT 
MISERABLE BACK 
HERE AT HIS OLD 
HOUNTS.
6-3, NOTHING IN 
THE FRIAR 5TH, 
MIDDLE OF THE 
NIGHT, STILL 
TIED AT 1.
@?
MATT: 1-1 TIE 
THROUGH 4 AND A 
HALF, IAN 
KINSLER LEADS 
OFF FOR THE 
RANGERS, 
KINSLER, LAIRD 
AND MATTHEWS FOR
TEXAS.
RANGERS GOT A 
LOAN STRIKE IN 
THE 4TH.
IAN KINSLER A 
STRIKEOUT VICTIM
IN HIS FIRST 
AT-BAT TONIGHT.
ONE OF SIX 
POSTED BY CHRIS 
YOUNG.
WE HAVE A FREPLY
WAGER OUT ON THE
LINE TONIGHT 
THAT WE SHOULD 
PROBABLY BRING 
FANS INTO.
THE RANGERS AS 
WE MENTIONED ARE
38-33, PADRES 
37-33, 
STATISTICLY, 
ALMOST A DEAD 
HEAT.
SO AS A RESULT 
OF TONIGHT, ONE 
OF THESE TWO 
TEAMS WILL CLAIM
A SLIGHTLY 
BETTER RECORD 
AND WE GOT 
TOGETHER WITH 
OUR FRIEND AND 
COLLEAGUE, WHO 
IS THE RADIO 
VOICE OF THE SAN
DIEGO CHARGERS, 
JOSH LEWIN AND 
WE WERE GOING TO
DO ONE OF THOSE 
BETTS WHERE IT'S
A BOX OF FISH 
TACOS IN 
EXCHANGE FOR A 
BRISKET EATER --
MARK: GO BOLTS.
MATT: AND WE 
KACHL UP WITH IF
THE PADRES BEAT 
THE RANGERS, 
THEN JOSH IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO
CARRY AROUND 
HANK BAUERS BAGS
DURING THE 
CHARGERS SEASON.
MARK: HE DOES 
THAT ANYWAY, 
DOESN'T HE?
MATT: YOU'RE 
RIGHT.
WHOEVER LOSES 
THIS GAME HAS TO
WEAR A BIG HANK 
BAUER BUTTON 
AROUND FOR AT 
LEAST 24 HOURS, 
WHICH FOR ME 
WOULD BE A BIG 
HONOR.
FOR JOSH IT 
WOULD BE 
AWKWARD, GIVEN 
THE NEXT TIME HE
WILL BE IN SAN 
DIEGO WOULD BE 
AT A CHARGERS 
PRACTICE.
I THINK JOSH 
SHOULD HAVE TO 
WEAR A HAMMER 
BUTTON AROUND 
ALL THE TIME 
ANYWAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BETTS OFF.
HE SHOULD BE 
GLAD TO WEAR 
THAT BUTTON.
FLY BOUGHT OUT 
TO SHORT RIGHT 
FIELD, GILES 
CALLING OFF 
GARFIELD AND 
THAT WIND HAS 
BEEN A REAL 
PROBLEM TONIGHT,
FOLKS.
NOT TO MAKE ANY 
EXCUSES -- 
MARK: THAT'S A 
BALL THAT'S GOT 
TO BE CAUGHT.
THERE WAS 
COMMUNICATION 
DIFFICULTIES OUT
THERE, IN 
SHALLOW RIGHT 
FIELD.
JOSH BARFIELD, 
NOW HE SQUARES 
UP, BACK 
PEDALING, STILL,
BUT HE CALLS 
OFF, BUT JUDGING
BY LOOKING AT 
THESE TWO 
PLAYERS, I THINK
THAT'S GILES 
BALL, HE HAS TO 
TAKE CHARGE 
BECAUSE JOSH 
BARFIELD DID 
PEEL OFF.
MATT: SO IAN 
KINSLER IS 
ABOARD ON A 
WIND-BLOWN 
DOUBLE THAT WAS 
LOST IN THE 
DUSTY TEXAS 
NIGHT AND NOW 
GERALD LAIRD HAS
A CHANCE TO 
KNOCK IN THAT 
RUN.
KINSLER AT 
SECOND, NOBODY 
DOWN. 
MARK: NOW THE 
BIG BOY IS GOING
TO HAVE TO REACH
BACK AND DO SOME
BIG LEAGUE 
PITCHING.
MATT: IAN 
KINSLER TAGS UP 
AND GETS TO 
THIRD.
WOW!
THAT BALL WAS 
NOT HIT VERY 
DEEP, MUD CAT.
MARK: HEADS-UP 
PLAY BY KINSLER.
AS SOON AS THAT 
BALL WAS HIT HE 
WAS IMMEDIATELY 
BACK TO THE BAG 
TO TAG UP AND 
HE'S CHALLENGING
THE OUTFIELDERS 
OF THE PADRES.
BRIAN CIRCLES 
THE BALL, HE 
COMES UP 
THROWING.
ALL THEY NEED 
SNOU A FLY BALL.
MATT: THEY'RE 
GOING TO CHANGE 
THE SCORING 
SDWIGS ON THAT 
BALL THAT 
KINSLER HIT AND 
HANG AN ERROR ON
GILES, SO IT'S 
AN E-9 THAT PUT 
THE LEAD-OFF 
HITTER AT 
SECOND, THAT MAN
AT THIRD WITH 
ONE GONE FOR 
MATTHEWS WHO 
STRUGGLED IN THE
SERIES, 0-6, 
HE'S PUNCHED OUT
TWICE TONIGHT.
MARK: INFIELD 
ABOUT HALFWAY 
IN, MATTY, DID 
YOU SEE THAT?
HOPEFULLY A 
ONE-HOPPER AT 
ONE OF THE 
INFIELDERS, 
TRYING TO CUT 
DOWN THAT RUN.
NOT ALL THE WAY 
IN AND NOT ALL 
THE WAY BACK.
THE WAY THE 
SCORING IS GOING
TONIGHT YOU WANT
TO GET THAT RUN 
AT THE PLATE.
MATT: INTO RIGHT
FIELD FOR GILES,
DOES HE SEE IT?
HE DOES.
AND THAT'S MORE 
THAN ENOUGH TO 
TAG AND SCORE 
KINSLER WITH THE
GO-AHEAD RUN.
CREDIT GARY 
MATTHEWS WITH 
HIS 38TH RBI OF 
THE YEAR.
TEXAS TAKES 
THEIR FIRST LEAD
OF THE NIGHT.
MARK: MATTY, DID
IT SEEM LIKE 
THAT BALL WAS 
HANG NG UP THERE
FOREVER AND 
EVER?
MATT: IT WAS 
HARD TO READ HIS
BODY LANGUAGE 
OUT THERE, IT 
APPEARED FOR A 
MINUTE LIKE HE 
DIDN'T SEE IT.
IT.
MARK: IT LOOKS 
TO ME LIKE THE 
CORNER IS DARK, 
AND IT LOOKS 
LIKE THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH LIGHT OUT
THERE.
HE MAY HAVE LOST
IT THERE FOR A 
SECOND.
THAT'S GOT TO BE
THE WORST 
FEELING.
MATT: MICHAEL 
YOUNG NOW WITH A
RUN IN.
MARK: MATTY FROM
OUR VANTAGE 
POINT UP HERE IN
THE BOOTH, LOOK 
AT HOW IT HAS A 
LOT OF LIGHT 
THERE AND YOU 
LOOK AT THE 
CORNER 
OUTFIELDERS, AND
IT'S DARK.
MATT: THERE 
LOOKS LIKE A 
DARK SPOT, 
ESPECIALLY IN 
RIGHT.
THAT WILL GET 
OUT OF -- INTO 
THE STANDS.
0-2 TO MICHAEL 
YOUNG.
MARK: BAD 
CANDLES IN THE 
OUTFIELD.
MATT: THAT'S A 
GOOD SHOT THAT 
ILLUSTRATES THAT
DARK SPOCHLT I'M
NOT SURE IF IT 
HAS SOMETHING TO
DO WITH THE ROOF
IN RIGHT FIELD 
OR THE 
PAVILLION.
MARK: WHO KNOWS?
I THINK WE 
SHOULD CALL HANK
BAUER AND ASK 
WHAT HE THINKS.
MATT: WHAT ARE 
THE CHANCES IF 
THE THINGS WERE 
REVERSED THAT 
HANK WOULD WEAR 
A JOSH LEWIN 
BUTTON AROUND?
MARK: HANK WOULD
DO IT ANYWAY.
MATT: HE WOULD 
SAY WHY DO I 
NEED TO WEAR A 
JOSH LEWIN 
BUTTON EVERY 
NIGHT WHEN I 
JUST PACK HIM UP
AND TAKE HIM 
WITH ME EVERY 
NIGHT.
HAS THE HAMMER 
DONNIE JAIL 
TIME?
[CHUCKLES]?
SERIOUSLY, UNTHE
GUY BETTER THAN 
I DO.
HE'S A TREAT.
REDEFINING 
POLITICAL 
INCORRECTNESS 
WITH EVERY WORD.
A CALLED STRIKE 
3 TAKEN BY 
YOUNG.
ANOTHER 
STRIKEOUT FOR 
C.Y. BUT A RUN 
FOR THE RANGERS 
AND FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT TEXAS 
LEADS.
2-1.
MATT: PADRES 
TAKE ON THE 
MARINERS ON 
FRIDAY NIGHT, 
AND EVERYBODY 
GETS A BEACH 
TOWEL, TICKETS 
ARE AVAILABLE AT
PADRES.COM OR 
CALL 
877-FRIARS-TIX.
MIKE CAMERON 
LEADS OFF INNING
NO. 5 AND FOR 
THE FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT THE 
PADRES TRAIL 
TEXAS.
MIKE HAS SCORED 
THE ONLY SAN 
DIEGO RUN THUS 
FAR.
MARK: THIS IS 
THE GOOD PART OF
THE LINE UP FOR 
THE PADRES IF 
THEY CAN GET TO 
MILLWOOD.
2 HITS FOR 
GILES, 1 FOR 
CAMERON, MIKE 
SCORED A RUN, 
ALSO, AS MATTY 
MENTIONED.
MILLWOOD WITH 
THE FASTBALL, 
GETTING IT UP TO
94.
WE KNOW IF HE 
HITS THE SWEET 
SPOT OF THE 
PLATE, PADRE 
HITTERS CAN DO 
SOME DAMAGE.
MATT: KEVIN 
MILLWOOD YET TO 
WALK A BATTER 
TONIGHT.
MIKE CAMERON 
LINES TO LEFT.
THAT BALL WAS 
HIT HARD BUT 
MENCH IS IN 
FRONT TO MAKE 
THE CATCH.
PROBABLY 
OVERUSEDED THE 
TERM "STRIKE 
THROWER" AND 
WHEN I SPEAK OF 
"WE" I SPEAK OF 
US AS AN 
INDUSTRY.
HE IS ALWAYS 
AROUND THE 
PLATE, ONLY 17 
WALKS THIS YEAR 
IN ALMOST 100 
INNINGS.
HIS WALKS PER 
9-INNING RATIO 
IS AMONG THE 
BEST IN MAJOR 
LEAGUE BASEBALL,
AROUND FEWER 
THAN 1 AND A 
HALF PER START.
GILES NOW WITH 1
GONE. 
MARK: YOU LOVE 
THAT AS A 
MANAGER, OF 
COURSE AS A 
PITCHING COACH, 
BUT ALSO YOUR 
DEFENSE.
WE TALK ABOUT IT
SO MANY TIMES.
YOU WANT A GUY 
TO BE AROUND THE
PLATE AND YOU 
WANT ACTION IN 
THE INFIELD AND 
IN THE OUTFIELD.
MAKE THEM EARN 
THEIR WAY ON.
MATT: GILES 
GROUNDS TO 
SHORTSTOP, 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
HAS IT AND 
THROWS HIM OUT.
2 AWAY.
WELL, IN STARK 
CONTRAST TO THE 
SLUG FES THE 
PADRES ENJOYED 
LAST NIGHT, ONLY
1 EXTRA-BASE 
HIT, AND THIS 
COMING ON THE 
HEELS OF LAST 
NIGHT, WHERE WE 
SAW THEM HIT 6 
EXTRA BASE HITS 
LAST NIGHT.
AND THAT HAS 
EVERYTHING TO DO
WITH KEVIN 
MILLWOOD.
MARK: HE'S 
GOTTEN 
GROUNDERS, WHEN 
HE REALLY NEEDED
IT, COUPLE 
DOUBLE PLAYS, 2 
TURNED BY TEXAS 
TONIGHT.
MATT: 0-1 THE 
COUNT TO PIAZZA.
MIKE IS HITLESS 
TONIGHT, 0-2.
SWING AND A HIGH
DRIVE INTO THE 
OPPOSITE FIELD, 
MARK DeROSA ON 
THE MOVE, 
LOOKING UP AND 
IT'S GONE!
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] SOLO 
SHOT FOR MIKE, 
HIS 9TH OF THE 
YEAR AND SAN 
DIEGO GETS IT 
RIGHT BACK, TIED
AT 2 APIECE.
THAT'S WHY THE 
BIG BOY IS IN 
THERE.
MARK: I LOVE THE
FOLLOW-THROUGH 
OF MIKE PIAZZA 
WHEN HE GOES TO 
THE OPPOSITE 
FIELD.
WATCH THE 
RECOIL.
HEAD DOWN, OH, 
YEAH!
THAT'S SOME 
KINDA NICE.
395-FOOT SHOT 
FOR THE BIG BOY!
MATT: NO. 406 IN
THE HALL OF FAME
CAREER OF 
PIAZZA, NEXT UP 
ON THE ALL-TIME 
LIST, DO YOU 
COME SNYDER AND 
40TH PLACE, 
ALL-TIME.
SO NOW ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ, WITH A
2-0 COUNT.
MARK: MATTY, 
ONLY THE 9TH 
HOME RUN GIVEN 
UP BY MILLWOOD 
THIS YEAR.
MATT: HE IS 
STILL SOME KIND 
A STRONG.
2-1 THE COUNT TO
ADRIAN, NOW.
3-1 TO GONZALEZ.
BELLHORN NEXT, 
2-OUT BASES 
EMPTY, TIED AT 2
AFTER THE PIAZZA
SHOT.
NOW IT'S 3-2 TO 
GONZAL.
TURNING INTO A 
PRETTY GOOD 
SERIES FOR MIKE.
2 RUNS BATTED IN
YESTERDAY, ONE 
IN A HOME RUN 
TONIGHT.
HE'LL BE IN 
THERE TOMORROW 
AT THE D.H. 
SPOT.
GONZALEZ FOLLOWS
WITH A DRIVE 
INTO THE 
OPPOSITE FIELD.
GARY MATTHEWS 
READ IT WELL OFF
THE BAT AND RUNS
IT DOWN.
RARE LONG BALL 
SUCCESS AGAINST 
KEVIN MILLWOOD, 
MIKE PIAZZA GOES
DEEP FOR THE 9TH
TIME THIS YEAR.
WE'RE TIED AT 2.
MATT: 2-2 TIE AS
WE GO TO THE 
HOME HALF OF 
INNING NO. 6, 
SAN DIEGO 
COUNTERING THE 
RANGERS 5TH 
INNING RUN WITH 
A PIAZZA SOLO 
BLAST AND WE ARE
TIED ONCE AGAIN,
A 2-2 DRAW AS 
CHRIS YOUNG GOES
TO WORK ON MARK 
TEIXEIRA.
MARK: MATTY, THE
IDEAL SITUATION 
HERE FOR CHRIS 
YOUNG AND THE 
PADRES, AFTER 
THE 108TH SPICH 
A QUICK INNING 
HERE IN THE 6TH,
KEEP IT TIED SO 
HE CAN BE THE 
PITCHER OF 
RECORD AND 
HOPEFULLY THE 
PADRES THE NEXT 
HALF OF THE 
INNING CAN ADD 
ON AND HAVE THAT
MAN, THE BIG, 
6-10 RIGHT 
HANDER GET THEM 
TO VICTORY.
MATT: 2-2 TO 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
0-2 TONIGHT.
WE TALK ABOUT 
THIS OFTEN, 
GETTING IN ASK 
OUT OF TOWN 
WHILE A TEAM'S 
PREMIERE POWER 
GUY IS HURTING A
BY THE.
MARK: OH, MY.
MATT: HE 
DISCARDED THE 
BAT THINKING IT 
WAS 0-4, HE'LL 
HAVE A SLICE OF 
HUMBLE PIE.
MARK: WHAT DID I
TELL YOU ABOUT 
GETTING BREAKS, 
MATTY?
LOOK AT THIS 
PITCH.
I THINK IT'S A 
BALL.
BUT YOU KNOW 
WHAT?
CHRIS YOUNG IS 
GETTING ANOTHER 
CRACK.
MATT: WE TALKED 
ABOUT THE 
DROP-OFF BETWEEN
LAST YEAR AND 
THIS FOR MARK 
TEIXEIRA.
BATTING AVERAGE 
IS A WASH AND IN
THE SAME NUMBER 
OF AT-BATS AFTER
71 GAMES THE 
REAL DIFFERENCE 
COMES WITH 
POWER.
20 HOME RUNS AT 
THIS POINT OF 
THE SEASON LAST 
YEAR, AND ONLY 6
AS WE STAND 
TODAY.
MATT: 3-2.
DRAMATIC UPPER 
CUT ON THAT 
SWING AS HE POPS
IT INTO SHORT 
RIGHT FOR JOSH 
BARFIELD.
1 GONE.
KEEP 'EM QUIET.
BE SURE TO TUNE 
INTO A BRAND NEW
EDITION OF "SAN 
DIEGO INSIDER" 
TONIGHT.
SOME SAY MIRAMAR
IS THE ANSWER 
FOR THE AIRPORT,
BUT THE MILITARY
SAYS NO.
WILL JOINT USE 
WORK?
SOME SURPRISING 
ANSWERS ON THE 
ISSUE ON "SAN 
DIEGO INSIDER 
MAGAZINE."
RIGHT AFTER THE 
GAME TONIGHT.
HANK BLALOCK 
WITH 1 GONE NOW.
TALKED ABOUT IT 
EARLIER, THE 
FACT THAT HANK 
BLALOCK GREW UP 
WATCHING TONY 
GWYNN AND HIS 
SWING.
YOU COULD FILL 
OUT A TEAM OF 
CURRENT BIG 
LEAGUERS WHO 
INITIAL WATCHING
OF SWINGS CAME 
FROM WATCHING 
TONY GWYNN.
MARK: HEY, LOOK 
AT THAT?
CHRIS YOUNG 
FINISHES UP IN A
NICE FIELDING 
POSITION AND 
MAKES THE SNAG.
MATT: LOOK AT 
THAT.
HE'S AN ATHLETE,
NOW.
UP TO 116 
PITCHES, HERE, 
AND WITH 2 GONE 
HE'LL GO TO WORK
ON MARK DeROSA, 
A GUY WHOSE 
GIVEN EVERYBODY 
TROUBLE THIS 
SERIES, 4 FOR 6.
GOTTA FIGURE, 
MUD CAT THAT 
WITH THE PITCH 
COUNT GETTING TO
1200, CHRIS 
YOUNG WILL NOT 
BE BACK.
MARK: YEAH, AND 
THAT'S WHY I WAS
SAYING.
JOHN ADKINS, LOW
CARB THERE IN 
THE PADRE 
BULLPEN.
MATT: 0-2 TO 
MARK DeROSA.
MARK: I THINK HE
MIGHT DROP THE 
HAMMER ON HIM 
RIGHT HERE.
NO, HIGH HEAT.
MATT: BALL AND 2
STRIKES.
MENCH NEXT, IN 
FACT, THE 5 AND 
6 SPOTS HAVE 
BEEN PRODUCTIVE 
FOR THE RANGERS 
TONIGHT.
AND THE 1-2.
ANOTHER HIGH 
FASTBALL FOULED 
BACK.
YOUNG'S NUMBERS 
IN THIS BALLPARK
LAST YEAR WERE 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
THAN HIS OVERALL
NUMBERS.
WHETHER THAT HAD
ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH THE FACT 
THAT THE RANGERS
THOUGHT HE WAS 
EXPENDABLE OR 
NOT, WE DON'T 
KNOW.
HE HAD A 4.86 
E.R.A. HERE LAST
YEAR AND OF HIS 
31 STARTS 20 OF 
THEM CAME IN 
THIS BALLPARK.
THE GUY WON 12 
GAMES AND TWHA 
TIED A ROOKIE 
RANGER'S RECORD.
MARK: I HEARD 
THAT THE PADRES 
WERE INTERESTED 
IN GERALD LAIRD,
THE CATCHER, BUT
THEY WANTED TO 
HANG ON TO HIM, 
BECAUSE HE'S THE
FUTURE FOR THEM 
IN CATCHERS, THE
NEXT YEARS, AND 
THAT'S WHEN 
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
NAME CAME UP AND
THEY JUMPED ON 
THE DEAL.
MATT: 2-2.
MARK: PRETTY 
GOOD PITCH.
MATT: THERE WAS 
YOUR HANK BAUER 
PITCH RIGHT 
THERE.
THAT'S WHAT WE 
WERE TALKING 
ABOUT, 12 WINS 
BY A ROOKIE 
PITCHER, A SHARE
OF THE FRANCHISE
RECORD WITH 
KEVIN BROWN AND 
EDWIN CORREA.
THERE'S BALL 4, 
HE LOST MARK 
DeROSA.
MARK: I THOUGHT 
HE HAD HIM WITH 
THAT BREAKING 
BALL.
MATT: HERE COMES
DARREN BALSLEY 
AND IT'S 
GENERALLY, AS WE
KNOW, A 
CONVERSATION 
WHEN DARREN 
BALSLEY COMES 
OUT AND A MOVE 
WHEN WE SEE 
BOCH, SO THIS 
WILL BE HOW DO 
YOU FEEL, DO YOU
WANT ONE MORE 
GUY?
MARK: LOOKING AT
THE BODY 
LANGUAGE OF 
CHRIS YOUNG, IT 
REALLY DOESN'T 
LOOK LIKE HE'S 
LABORING THAT 
MUCH, HE THREW A
NICE BREAKING 
BALL, COULD HAVE
BEEN EASILY 
CALLED STRIKE 3.
HE DID NOT GET 
THE CALL.
HE THREW A 
FASTBALL DOWN 
AND AWAY.
THE LEGS MIGHT 
BE GETTING 
HEAVY.
IT WOULD BE 
TOUGH TO GET IN 
THAT POINTING 
DOWN POSITION, 
EXACTLY WHERE HE
WANTS THE BALL.
MATT: KEVIN 
MENCH WALKED AND
SINGLED IN A RUN
TONIGHT.
MARK: YOU KNOW, 
I THINK THIS 
COMES DOWN TO A 
MOVE BRUCE BOCHY
WANTS -- HE 
WANTS TO HAVE 
CHRIS YOUNG GET 
THE VICTORY.
DON'T YOU THINK?
MATT: THERE GOES
MARK DeROSA ON 
THE FIRST PITCH 
AND THE SHOT 
FOULED.
I WOULD AGREE, I
THINK THAT'S THE
MOTIVATION FOR 
GIVING THE GUY 
THE CHANCE TO 
FINISH THE 
INNING.
ABSOLUTELY.
MARK: THE FIRST 
PITCH FASTBALL, 
THE RUNNER WAS 
GOING, BUT MENCH
CAN'T CATCH UP 
WITH IT, FOULING
IT OUT OF PLAY.
MATT: AT 125 
PITCHES, THIS IS
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
DEEPEST PITCH 
COUNT OF THE 
YEAR.
AND DARE I SAY 
THAT -- OR 
DIDN'T CHAN HO 
HAVE A START 
EARLIER WHERE HE
WENT 127, 131?
MARK: HE MAY 
HAVE.
MATT: THERE'S 
THE FORMER 
RANGER.
YOU KNOW, BOTH 
OF THE DEALS THE
PADRES HAVE 
WORKED OUT WITH 
TEXAS HAVE 
WORKED OUT 
PRETTY GOOD.
MARK: SURE.
MATT: OKAY FOR 
BOTH TEAMS, BUT 
REAL GOOD FOR 
SAN DIEGO.
MARK: REMEMBER 
ADAM EATON HAD 
THAT ADAM EATON 
SURGERY.
REMEMBER, WE 
TALKED ABOUT THE
SURGERY WITH 
ADAM HIMSELF IN 
FRONT OF THE 
DUGOUT THE OTHER
DAY AND WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT 
TAKING THE 
LIGAMENT OUT OF 
ONE ARM AND PUT 
IT GO IN HIS 
FINGER AND THE 
HIRSHISER 
SURGERY WAS THE 
ELBOW SURGERY, 
AND I DUBBED IT 
THE ADAM EATON 
SURGERY.
MATT: BOCH DID 
EVERYTHING HE 
CAN TO LET CHRIS
YOUNG FINISH THE
6TH, AND THEN A 
MISS REPLY A 
HARD HIT BALL 
AND THAT'S GOING
TO BE IT FOR 
C.Y.
HE COULDN'T WAIT
ANY LONGER.
HE HAD JOHN 
ADKINS UP P & IT
LOOKS LIKE 
EMBREE IS UP OUT
OF THE BULLPEN.
EVERYTHING IS 
ALWAYS ON SALE 
AT MOTOWORLD.
WE'LL BE BACK.
MATT: STILL A 
2-2 SDPIE CHRIS 
YOUNG FINALLY 
REMOVED.
BOY, AS WE 
MENTIONED A 
MOMENT AGO, BOCH
DID EVERYTHING 
HE COULD TO LET 
HIM FINISH THE 
INNING BUT HE 
ENDS WITH 7 
STRIKEOUTS 
TONIGHT.
MARK: HE WAS 
GOING UP THE 
LADDER, AND 
WE'VE SAID SINCE
GAME 1 OF THIS 
SERIES, THEY 
LIKE THE HIGH, 
FASTBALL.
OCCASIONALLY HE 
WOULD DROP A 
BREAKING BALL, 
THE SECOND AND 
THIRD TIME 
AROUND.
THAT WAS A 
BREAKING BALL 
RIGHT THERE.
A GREAT EFFORT, 
GOOD BIG LEAGUE 
OUTING FOR THE 
RIGHT HANDER.
AND NOW THEY'LL 
GO THE OTHER 
SIDE AND ALAN 
EMBREE WILL TRY 
TO END THIS.
MATT: HE WAS ONE
OF 5 PADRE 
RELIEVERS TO GET
INTO THE BOX 
SCORE LAST 
NIGHT.
HE WENT 2/3RD'S 
OF AN INNING.
HIS JOB IS 
SIMPLY TO GET 
THIS MAN AND 
FINISH THIS LAST
OF THE 6TH.
RERZ GO, FIRST 
PITCH TAKEN FOR 
A STRIKE.
HOW ABOUT THAT 
CALL?
MARK: GUTSY, 
YES.
YOU BETTER MAKE 
SURE THAT YOU 
CAN GET THOSE 
BAGS.
LOOK AT THE WAY 
THE DEFENSE IT 
PLAYING.
IT LOOKED LIKE 
CASTILLA WAS 
PLAYING BACK, 
THEY'RE LOOKING 
FOR HIM TO PULL,
THE INFIELD IS 
BACK.
MATT: MARK 
DeROSA WITH JUST
HIS SECOND 
STOLEN BASE AND 
MEFRJ IN HIS 
FIRST ATTEMPT OF
THE YEAR.
THAT CAUGHT 
EVERYBODY BY 
SURPRISE.
MARK: AND ALAN 
EMBREE OVER 
LOOKED THEM AT 
SECOND BASE, 
TOO.
MATT: JAM SHOT, 
POPPED HIM UP, 
GREENE READ IT 
WELL OFF THE BAT
AND IS THERE TO 
FINISH THE 
INNING.
NOTHING COMES, 2
RUNNERS LEFT 
STRANDED, WE 
PLAYED 6.
TIED AT TWOO.
2 
MATT: FRIENDS, 
LOG ONTO 
PADRES.COM AND 
CASTILLA YOUR 
VOTES FOR THE 
'06 ALL-STAR 
TEAM, AND MAKE 
SURE THE PADRES 
ARE REPRESENTED 
IN PITTSBURGH.
YOU MIGHT WANT 
TO CHECK AND 
MAKE SURE THIS 
GUY ISN'T LIVING
IN YOUR ZIP CODE
WHILE YOU'RE ON 
YOUR COMPUTER.
DON'T MESS WITH 
TEXAS!
MARK BELLHORN 
LEADS THINGS OFF
IN THE SAN DIEGO
7TH.
BELLHORN, GREENE
AND CASTILLA, AS
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
CONTINUES, AND 
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
WHOSE PITCH 
COUNT AT 1 POINT
TONIGHT WAS ON 
LINE WITH THAT 
OF HIS OPPOSITE 
NUMBER HAS 
REALLY STARTED 
TO WORK QUICKLY 
NOW, SECOND AND 
THIRD TIME 
THROUGH.
HE HAD A 6-PITCH
4TH, A 5-PITCH 
5TH, AND EVEN 
WITH THE HOME 
RUN TO PIAZZA IN
THE 6TH INNING, 
HE HAD A QUICK 
6.
UP AND IN TO 
BELLHORN, 2-1.
MARK: EVEN 
THOUGH THAT WAS 
ONLY THE 77TH 
PITCH BY 
MILLWOOD, THE 
LAST COUPLE OF 
PITCHES HAVE 
BEEN UP.
I DON'T KNOW IF 
IT'S BY DESIGN, 
BUT I DOUBT IT.
A HIGH FASTBALL 
TO BELLHORN 
FOULED BACK AND 
THEN THE HIGH, 
BREAKING BALL.
STILL HAS THE 
2-SEAM RUNNING 
FASTBALL DOWN 
AND AWAY TO THE 
LEFTIES.
MATT: LAIRD SETS
UP WAY OUTSIDE, 
AND BELLHORN 
FOULS IT OFF.
TOMORROW, THE 
GAME 3 PITCHING 
MATCH-UP, AND, 
AGAIN, NO TV 
TOMORROW IN THE 
DAY GAME, 
HENSLEY FOR SAN 
DIEGO, JOHN 
RHEINECKER FOR 
THE RANGERS.
MARK: JOHN 
RHEINECKER?
MATT: FIRST-YEAR
LEFT HANDER, WHO
IS 2-1.
THE RANGERS HAVE
HAD TROUBLE WITH
THE FOUR AND 
FIVE SPOTS IN 
HIR ROTATION.
THEY JUST PUT 
KAMERON LOE ON 
THE DISABLED 
LIST YESTERDAY 
AND WE'RE TOLD 
THAT TEHADA IS 
GOING TO COME UP
FROM TRIPLE-A 
OKLAHOMA TO FILL
IN THAT SPOT 
NEXT WEEK.
2 BALLS, 2 
STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO 
BELLHORN.
FULL COUNT NOW.
MARK: I THINK 
THE PADRES AS WE
GO LATE IN THE 
BALL GAME, WE 
TALKED ABOUT 
LAIRD BEHIND 
HOME PLATE AND 
HIS SUCCESS AT 
THROWING OUT 
RUNNERS, THE 
PADRES ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO 
THIS VIA POWER 
OR TRYING TO GET
RUNNERS ACROSS.
THEY CAN THROW 
THE RUNNING GAME
OUT THE WINDOW 
UNLESS YOU PUT 
ON A HIT AND 
RUN.
MATT: JUST 
FOULED DOWN THE 
CORNER IN RIGHT.
THERE'S YOUR NET
RIGHT THERE, MUD
CAT.
MARK: THERE WAS 
ONE DOWN THE 
LEFT FIELD LINE,
ALSO.
HELLO, TEX.
MATT: THERE'S 
THE COWARD OF 
THE COUNTY 
HIMSELF, RIGHT 
THERE.
MARK: THAT'S A 
SWEET LID.
MATT: AND 
THERE'S BALL 4 
TO BELLHORN, THE
LEAD-OFF WALK 
ISSUED HERE IN 
THE 7TH.
MARK: HERE IS 
THE SITUATION I 
WAS JUST TALKING
ABOUT MATTY, 
WITH THE FIRST 
BASEMAN, 
TEIXEIRA HOLDING
ON THE RUNNER, 
BELLHORN, THERE 
IS A HUGE HOLE 
TO THE RIGHT 
SIDE.
MATT: GREENIE 
0-2 TONIGHT.
HE HAD A SINGLE 
IN YESTERDAY'S 
OPENER.
MARK: AND ALSO 
AT THIRD BASE, 
BLALOCK IS 
CREEPING IN.
I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER HE'S 
ANTICIPATING A 
BUNT OR 
WHATEVER, BUT HE
WAS UP ON THE 
GRASS A LITTLE 
BIT AGO.
MATT: OUT OF THE
STRETCH THE 
FIRST PITCH TO 
KHALIL, SLIDER, 
FOULED BACK.
THERE'S NOBODY 
UP THROWING IN 
THE RANGER 
BULLPEN YET, 
THOUGH A COUPLE 
OF GUYS ARE UP 
AND STANDING OUT
THERE AND THE 
RANGERS, LIKE 
THE PADRES, 
WORKED 
RELATIVELY DEEP 
INTO THEIR 
BULLPEN LAST 
NIGHT IN THE 
OPENER.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
TAKING
CONSIDERABLE 
TIME BETWEEN 
PITCHES HERE 
LATE.
AND OUT OF THE 
STRETCH AGAIN, 
GREENE SWINGS 
AND SENDS A 
DRIVE WELL HIT 
OUT TO RIGHT 
CENTER FIELD, 
GARY MATTHEWS ON
THE RUN AND HE 
MAKES THE WILL 
LEE MAYS GRAB.
A FINE CATCH BY 
GARY MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR.
MARK: I THOUGHT 
THIS BALL HAD 
EXTRA BASES 
WRITTEN ALL OVER
IT.
GARY MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR HAVING A 
HECK OF A YEAR 
AT THE PLATE AND
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NICELY DONE.
HE ALMOST 
OVERRAN THAT 
BALL IT LOOKS 
LIKE, A LITTLE 
BY THE.
THAT'S A HUGE 
OUT. 
MATT: VINNY 
CASTILLA NOW 
WITH 1 GONE, 
BELLHORN REMAINS
AT FIRST.
VINNY STILL 
TRYING TO 
CONVERT ON THE 
FIVE-GAME 
HITTING STREAK 
TONIGHT, 3 FOR 4
OPENER 
YESTERDAY, 
HITLESS IN 2 
AT-BATS TONIGHT.
MARK: TELL YOU 
WHAT, KEVIN 
MILLWOOD, HE 
KNOWS EXACTLY 
THE SCOUTING 
REPORT.
FIRST PITCH 
SLIDER AWAY.
HENESS HE'S 
HACKING EARLY IN
THE COUNT.
MATT: COME 
INSIDE AND HE 
POPS IT UP.
THAT'S GOING TO 
GET INTO THE 
SEATS.
MARK: BALL IS 
COMING BACK.
MATT: NOT INTO 
THE SEATS AT 
ALL.
IT'S COMING BACK
INDEED.
WOW!
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MATT: NEVER GIVE
UP ON A POP OVER
TO THAT THIRD 
BASE SIDE OFF 
THE RIGHT 
HANDER'S SIDE, 
AS HANK BLALOCK 
PROVES ME WRONG.
MARK: BOCH 
ALMOST HAD TO 
GET OUT OF THE 
WAY, JIM 
MALONEY.
THAT BALL TUCK 
18, 20 DIFFERENT
TURNS IN THE 
AIR.
HANK BLALOCK 
SQUEEZES IT FOR 
THE OUT. 
MATT: 2 GONE 
NOW.
UP TO BARFIELD 
TO TRY TO 
FURTHER THAT 
LEAD-OFF WALK.
JOSH HAS ONE OF 
SAN DIEGO'S 6 
HITS TONIGHT ON 
THE FIRST PITCH 
HE POPS INTO 
FOUL TERRITORY.
TEIXEIRA MAKING 
THE CATCH.
MILLWOOD 
TIGHTENS UP 
AFTER THE 
LEAD-OFF WALK.
7TH INNING 
STRETCH IN 
ARLINGTON.
TIED AT 2.
MATT: COME OUT 
TO THE BALLPARK 
ON SATURDAY FOR 
GAME 2 OF THE 
WEEK END SERIES 
WITH THE 
MARINERS AND GET
THERE EARLY FOR 
FIESTA, CON LOS 
PADRES.
MARK: CALL 
877-FRIAR-TIX, 
OR PADRES.COM.
MATT: JOHN 
ADKINS GETS THE 
CALL AND IS ON 
THE MOUND NOW.
MARK: POSSIBLY 
FOR ADKINS, 
SOMEBODY OUT OF 
THE BULLPEN, 
HOPEFULLY, AND 
THE BOTTOM OF 
THE ORDER FOR 
JOHN.
MATT: IAN 
KINSLER LEADS 
THINGS OFF FOR 
TEXAS.
IT WILL BE 
KINSLER, LAIRD 
AND MATTHEWS, 
FOR THE RANGERS.
2 RUNS ON 6 
HITS, 2 ERRORS 
COMMITTED BY SAN
DIEGO TONIGHT, 
AND 2 RUNS, 4 
HITS, NO ERRORS 
BY THE RANGERS.
THIS IS WHAT WE 
EXPECTED COMING 
OUT TO THE 
BALLPARK 
TONIGHT.
WITH MILLWOOD 
VERSUS YOUNG, 
YOU DIDN'T LOOK 
FOR THIS TO BE 
THE OFFENSIVE 
NIGHT THAT BOTH 
TEAMS ENJOYED 
LAST NIGHT.
MARK: SO IT 
SEEMS LIKE THE 
MISSQUES ARE 
GOING TO BE THE 
STORY TONIGHT, 
HUH?
THANK GOODNESS 
THE ERROR IN THE
6TH BY VINNY 
CASTILLA DIDN'T 
SCORE ANY RUNS, 
LEFT TWO RUNNERS
STRANDED.
MATT: IS THAT 
JOE CAMEL?
I DON'T THINK 
THAT'S FAMILY 
FRIENDLY TO HAVE
A CIGARETTE 
MASCOT HERE.
MARK: I'M 
TALKING TO YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
SEE YOU, BIG 
BOY.
LOOK AT THE 
MULLET ON THAT 
GUY. 
MATT: I THINK 
THE "T" IS FOR 
TIRED.
GROUNDED OUT TO 
SHORTSTOP, 
KHALIL MAKES THE
PLAY.
DOESN'T THAT 
LOOK LIKE JOE 
CAMEL?
MARK: IT DOES 
LOOK LIKE HIM?
MATT: IAN 
KINSLER RETIRED 
FOR THE FIRST 
OUT OF THE 
INNING.
[CHUCKLES] 
MARK: YOU KNOW, 
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO 
GIVE TOM 
CETERSKI A POINT
IN THE TRUCK, IT
LOOKS LIKE 
FABIO.
MATT: GERALD 
LAIRD THE BATTER
NOW, AND HE 
GROUNDS TO 
GREENE.
GREENIE HAS NOT 
TAKEN ANY OF HIS
OFFENSIVE WOES 
TO THE FIELD 
WITH HIM THIS 
MONTH, THOUGH 
IT'S BEEN A HOT 
AND COLD MONTH 
AT THE PLATE, 
HE'S BEEN 
OUTSTANDING 
DEFENSE SIL.
MARK: HE KNOWS 
THAT HIS GLOVE 
IS VALUABLE, 
ESPECIALLY AT 
THE SHORTSTOP 
POSITION, 
THERE'S NO DOUBT
ABOUT THAT.
HE'S PROVEN IT 
SINCE HIS FIRST 
DAY IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES.
THAT'S A SERIOUS
TALENT RIGHT 
THERE.
MATT: THEY COULD
PUT HIM ON THAT 
NEW SHOW WITH 
REGIS.
GARY MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR WITH 2 
GONE AND HE 
PICKS ON THE 
FIRST PITCH AND 
BOUNCES IT INTO 
RIGHT FOR HIS 
FIRST HIT OF THE
SERIES.
SO THE 2-OUT 
SINGLE AGAINST 
ADKINS AND NOW 
JOHN WILL GO TO 
WORK AGAINST 
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
WHO IS 1-3 
TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, WE 
TALKED ABOUT THE
DISCREPANCY IN 
THESE TEAMS' 
RECORDS IN 1-RUN
DECISIONS LAST 
NIGHT.
THE RANGERS HAVE
NOT FAIRED WELL 
IN ONE-RUN BALL 
GAMES, LOSING 
ONE YESTERDAY, 
AND YOU STA TO
THINK ABOUT THAT
KIND OF NUMBER 
LATE IN A TIE 
GAME.
RANGERS ARE 8-13
IN ONE-RUN 
AFFAIRS THIS 
YEAR.
THEY'VE PLAYED 
IN A LOT OF 
CLOSE ONCE, TOO.
ONLY THE OAKLAND
A.'S HAVE PLAYED
IN MORE GAMES 
DECIDED BY 2 OR 
FEWER RUNS AMONG
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
CLUBS.
SPEAKING OF 
OAKLAND, THEY'RE
IN ACTION IN 
DENVER.
A.'S AND ROCKIES
TIED IN THE 4TH,
AND THE ANGLES 
DEFEATED 
SAN FRANCISCO, 
TODAY, AND THE 
DODGERS AND 
MARINERS ARE 
JUST GETTING 
UNDERWAY NOW.
THE WHITE SOX 
PUTTING THE HURT
ON ST. LOUIS 
AGAIN TONIGHT.
MARK: THEY HAD A
BIG NIGHT LAST 
NIGHT.
MATT: 12-4 IN 
THE 7TH INNING 
AT U.S. 
CELLULAR.
MARK: HAWK IS 
HAVING A HEY 
DAY, HUH?
MATT: I GOTTA 
BELIEVE THAT 
CARDINAL BULLPEN
IS PRETTY BEAT 
UP.
MARK: I THINK 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
TRIED TO PULL A 
FAST ONE, HE 
CAUGHT THAT BALL
AND ACTED LIKE 
THE BALL GOT BY 
HIM.
LET'S SEE THE 
ACTING JOB 
ADRIAN DOES.
SEE THAT?
MATT: GARY SAYS,
NIE TRY.
BIG SWING AND A 
MISS TO RETIRE 
THE SIDE.
ADKINS STRIKES 
OUT YOUNG, 
NOTHING IN THE 
RANGER 7TH, ON 
TO THE 8TH, 
STILL TIED 2 
APIECE.
MATT: TUNE IN 
FOR FORFRONT AND
MEET A MAN WHO 
FOR MORE THAN 3 
DECADES 
ANNOUNCED PADRES
GAMES AND HAS 
WRITTEN ABOUT 
HIS EXPERIENCES,
YOU SEE HIM ON 
THE LEFT, BOB 
CHANDLER, LONG 
TIME SAN DIEGO 
VOICE, ON 
FORFRONT 
TOMORROW NIGHT 
AT 4:30 AND 
8:30, LOG ONTO 
4SD.COM FOR MORE
INFORMATION.
E.Y. LEADS OFF 
TONIGHT.
AND HE HAD GOOD 
NUMBERS AGAINST 
MILLWOOD AND 
THAT WAS PART OF
THE DECISION 
THAT BRUCE BOCHY
MADE WHEN HE 
DECIDED TO START
YOUNG OVER BEN 
JOHNSON.
E.Y. TRYING TO 
VALIDATE THAT 
START TONIGHT.
MARK: HE COULD 
HAVE HAD A HIT 
EARLIER IN THE 
THIRD INNING, 
BUT MICHAEL 
YOUNG MADE A 
HECK OF A PLAY, 
TAKING A HIT 
AWAY FROM E.Y.
MATT: 1 BALL, 1 
STRIKE TO HERR TO HER 
RICK YOUNG.
MICHAEL YOUNG 
HAS TAKEN AWAY 
ALL 3 OF ERIC 
YOUNG'S PLATE 
APPEARANCES 
TONIGHT.
MILLWOOD ROCKS 
AND FIRES THE 
1-1, TURNS OVER 
A SLIDER, 2 
BALLS AND A 
STRIKE.
CHECK THAT, 2-2 
TO YOUNG.
AND, AGAIN, IT'S
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
FRUSTRATING E.Y.
TONIGHT.
SO ERIC YOUNG 
0-4 AGAINST 
MILLWOOD.
AND NOW MIKE 
CAMERON WHO HAS 
HAD A GOOD 
NIGHT, SINGLED, 
AND SCORED A 
RUN.
GILES NEXT AND 
THEN PIAZZA, AND
THIS MAY BE THE 
LAST OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE 
RUN-PRODUCING 
PART OF THE LINE
UP, YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO THINK 
THEY CAN GET 
SOMEBODY GOING 
WITH AT LEAST A 
BASE RUNNER TO 
PUT MILLWOOD OUT
OF THE STRETCH.
1-0 TO MIKE 
CAMERON.
THERE'S SOME 
TELLING NUMBERS 
FROM THE 8TH 
INNING ON IT HAS
NOT BEEN GOOD 
TIMES FOR KEVIN 
MILLWOOD.
THERE'S NOBODY 
UP BEHIND HIM 
RIGHT NOW.
INCH I WAS GOING
TO SAY, IN THE 
EVENT MAYBE OF 
AN EXTRA-BASE 
HIT OR 
SOMETHING, I 
KNOW BUCK 
SHOWALTER HAS A 
QUICK HOOK, 
ALTHOUGH 
MILLWOOD HAS 
BEEN AROUND A 
LONG, LONG TIME,
HE CAN FIGURE 
OUT WHICH WAY 
MILLWOOD IS 
GOING TO GO, BUT
I'M SURPRISED 
NOBODY IS UP IN 
THAT BULLPEN, 
EVEN THOUGH HE'S
ONLY THROWN 95 
PITCHES.
GOOD RATIO FOR 
KEVIN MILLWOOD, 
2-1.
MATT: CAMERON 
OFF THE END OF 
THE BAT, FRIEZ 
INTO SHORT RIGHT
CENTER FIELD, 
GARY MATTHEWS 
FOR OUT NO. 2.
OUTSIDE OF THE 
PIAZZA HOME RUN 
THERE HASN'T 
BEEN A LOT OF 
POP TONIGHT.
MIKE'S HOME RUN 
AND GILES R.B.I.
DOUBLE THE ONLY 
TWO EXTRA BASE 
HITS FOR SAN 
DIEGO, AND, 
AGAIN, NOT SO 
MUCH A CRITICISM
TO THE PADRES AS
IT IS TO KEVIN 
MILLWOOD AND 
WHAT HE'S DONE 
TONIGHT.
MARK: MILLWOOD 
HAS HAD GOOD 
DEFENSE BEHIND 
HIM.
WE'VE MENTIONED 
PLAYS THE 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
MADE, THE KHALIL
GREENE CENTER 
FIELD HIT BY 
GARY MATTHEWS, 
AND MILLWOOD HAS
HAD TWO DOUBLE 
PLAYS TONIGHT 
THAT HELPED HIS 
CAUSE, 
GROUNDERS, ON 
THE INFIELD, 
TOO.
MATT: A BALL AND
A STRIKE TO 
GILES.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF
THE WEAK SPOTS, 
IT'S BEEN AN
IT'S BEEN 
ACHILLES HEAL 
FOR THE RANGERS,
IS THE BULLPEN.
BUT WHEN THE 
STARTER STAYS 
OUT THERE FOR 8 
INNINGS, YOU 
DON'T HAVE A 
CHANCE TO GET 
INTO THAT.
HERE IS THE 1-2.
MARK: HE HAD A 
PITCH THERE, 
MATTY.
LOOKED LIKE HE 
WAS UP, MIDDLE 
OF THE PLATE AND
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
MAY BE RUBBING 
UP THAT NEW ROCK
OUT THERE 
THINKING, YOU 
KNOW, WHAT?
I JUST GOT AWAY 
WITH ONE.
MATT: A CROWD OF
NEARLY 30,000 
STRONG MAKING 
THEIR NOISE IN 
SUPPORT OF THEIR
STARTER, 2-2.
SO GILES FROM 
BEHIND IN THE 
DOWNTOWN A FULL 
COUNT NOW, 3-2, 
TRYING TO KEEP 
IT ALIVE FOR 
PIAZZA WHO HAS 
HOMERED TONIGHT.
MIKE WEIGHTS 
NEXT.
3-2 HOME.
BALL 4.
AND BY THE 
NARROWEST OF 
MARGINS, 
MILLWOOD HAS 
WALKED HIS 
SECOND HITTER OF
THE NIGHT.
SO NOW THE MAN 
RESPONSE I WILL 
FOR TONIGHT'S 
COORS LITE COLD,
HARD BLAST, MIKE
PIAZZA WHO 
STEPPED UP TO 
THE PLATE IN THE
6TH WITH 2 GONE.
THIS TIED IT. 
MIKE'S 9TH OF 
THE YEAR.
MARK: MATTY, 
WITH THAT WALK 
HE GOT A BEEHIVE
WORKING IN THAT 
TEXAS RANGERS 
BULLPEN.
THEY GOT UP IN A
HURRY.
RON MAHAY, THE 
LEFT HANDER, WE 
SAW HIM LAST 
NIGHT.
AND THE PITCHING
COACH BUYING 
TIME FOR THETHE 
LEFTY SO HE CAN 
GET LOOSE.
MATT: MIKE 41 ON
THE LIST OF MOST
CAREER HOME 
RUNS, AND IF HE 
KEEPS IT GOING 
IN 2007, HE WILL
SETTLE SOMEWHERE
IN THE HIGH 30'S
ON THE ALL-TIME 
HOME RUN LIST 
THIS YEAR.
ONE OF MIKE'S 9 
HAS COME TO WIN 
A BALL GAME.
REMEMBER THE 
DRAMATIC 9TH 
INNING HOME RUN 
AT WRIGLEY FIELD
IN APRIL?
PIAZZA TAKES A 
STRIKE HERE.
GOOD BREAKING 
BALL TO CATCH 
THE CORNER TO 
PUT MIKE IN THE 
HOLE, 0-2.
MARK: THAT WAS A
DANDY.
GREAT, PINPOINT 
CONTROL ON THE 
LAST 2 BREAKING 
BALLS.
STAY OUT OF THE 
HOT ZONE OF 
PIAZZA.
THAT'S A PERFECT
PITCH.
MAN!
YOU KNOW, FOR 
THROWING 104 
PITCHES, THAT 
BEING THE 105TH,
THAT'S PRETTY 
DARN GOOD.
MATT: FASTBALL 
THAT WAS TOO FAR
INSIDE FOR 
MILLWOOD TO GET 
HURT ON.
MARK: YEP.
MATT: GOOD 0-2 
PITCH.
36 TIMES IN MIKE
PIAZZA'S CAREER 
HE HAS COME UP 
WITH A MULTIPLE 
HOME RUN GAME.
MOST RECENTLY, 
LAST 
SEPTEMBER AS A 
MET IN 
WASHINGTON.
SPEAKING OF THE 
METS, THEY BLEW 
A LEAD AT HOME 
TONIGHT.
BILLY WAGNER 
BLEW A SAVE AS 
CINCINNATI CAME 
FROM BEHIND TO 
BEAT THEM.
THERE GOES GILES
AND THE THROW 
DOWN TO SECOND 
IS NOT IN TIME!
THE SNAEK ATTACK
STOLEN BASE BY 
GILES, HIS 5TH 
OF THE YEAR, 
HE'S IN SCORING 
POSITION NOW ON 
1-2 TO PIAZZA.
MARK: WE 
MENTIONED THAT 
LAIRD BEHIND 
HOME PLATE HAS 
THROWN OUT 60%, 
JUST IN TIME HE 
GETS UNDER THE 
TAG.
MATT: SLIDER 
MISSES OUTSIDE 
TO MAKE IT 2-2 
NOW, PIAZZA 
DOING A GOOD JOB
OF RECOGNIZING 
AND LAYING OFF.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
NEXT.
2-2 IS HIT ON 
THE FWROUND TO 
SHORTSTOP, YOUNG
IS THERE.
TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE 8TH, TIED, 2
APIECE.
MATT: SUNDAY AT 
PETCO PARK IS 
KIDS DAY, 14 AND
YOUNGER RECEIVE 
A GIVE AWAY ITEM
OF THE DECADE, 
MUD CAT.
MARK: WHAT'S 
THAT?
MATT: THE PADRES
MR. POTATO HEAD 
PADRE.
LOOK THAT.
THE ARM, THE 
EYES, THINK OF 
THE FUN.
MARK: THAT'S 
NICE.
MATT: TICKETS 
ARE AVAILABLE AT
PADRES.COM OR 
877-FRIAR-TIX.
THAT IS A VALID 
MR. POTATO HEAD,
TOO, NOT A 
KNOCK-OFF.
SCOTT GETS A 
FIRST PITCH OUT 
TONIGHT, AND HE 
MAKES HIS 33 HIS 33RD 
INNING.
YEAR.
A NEW CATCHER, 
HE IS WORKING, 
TOO, AS BOWEN 
HAS TAKEN OVER 
HIEN THE PLATE.
MATT: HERE IS 
HANK BLALOCK, 
NOW.
1 AWAY, BASES 
EMPTY, 2-2 TIE, 
LAST OF THE 8TH.
GOOD ONE 
TONIGHT.
HANK BLALOCK 
SENDS A DRIVE 
INTO CENTER, 
THIS WILL STAY 
PLAYABLE FOR 
MIKE CAMERON.
2 QUICK OUTS FOR
SCOTT LINEBRINK 
WHO IS PART OF 
WHAT IS 
STATISTICALLY 
THE BEST PULL 
BEEN IN MAJOR 
LEAGUE BASEBALL 
IN TERMS OF 
E.R.A., 3.23, 
THE LOWEST IN 
THE GAME.
MARK: CAN YOU 
SAY ROLAIDS 
RELIEF BULLPEN 
AWARD?
STARTERS LOVE 
THAT BUT IT'S A 
GREAT FEELING 
WHEN YOU LEAVE A
BALL GAME AND 
YOU HAVE 6, 7 
SOLID INNINGS 
AND YOU HAVE 
GUYS LIKE 
ADKINS, CASSIDY,
LINEBRINK COMING
IN.
HOPEFULLY THEY 
CAN BRIDGE THAT 
GAP TO TREVOR 
HOFFMAN, AS A 
FORMER FRIAR 
STARTS TO HEAT 
UP FOR THE 
RANGERS, AKINORI
OTSUKA.
MATT: AKI, OUR 
GUY.
MARK DeROSA 
STOLE A BASE 
TONIGHT, SECOND 
OF THE YEAR, AND
YOU TALKED ABOUT
IT YESTERDAY 
THAT WHAT AKI 
COMES IN IN A 
SAVE SITUATION 
IN ARLINGTON, 
THEY PLAY "HELLS
BELLS" OVER THE 
STADIUM INTERCOM
SYSTEM, AND AKI 
ABOUT A 
RESPECTFUL GUY 
THAT YOU WOULD 
EVER WANT TO 
MEET, AND BEFORE
THEY DID THAT, 
HE ASKED TREVOR 
IF IT WAS OKAY.
MARK: THAT'S 
AKI.
MATT: BASE HIT 
BACK UP THE 
HILGDZ.
MIDDLE.
MATT: 2-OUT 
SINGLE, SO MARK 
DeROSA IS ABOARD
AND NOW MENCH.
MARK: BOTH 
PITCHING STAFFS 
THIS EVENING, 
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
HAS GONE THE 
WHOLE WAY SO 
FAR, BUT 6 HITS 
SURRENDERED BY 
BOTH CLUBS, AND 
MARK DeROSA IS 
THE ONLY GUY IN 
THE LINE UP THAT
HAS 2 HITS.
MATT: HERE IS 
MENCH, NOW.
AGAIN, THE 5 AND
6 HOLES HAVE 
BEEN THE PROBLEM
SPOTS TONIGHT.
MENCH HAS A HIT 
AND AN R.B.I. 
HERE IS A 
QUESTION FOR YOU
MUD CAT.
MARK: OKAY.
MATT: WHAT DOES 
KEVIN MENCH HAVE
IN COMMON WITH 
OUR GOOD FRIEND 
GORDON SHAW FROM
THE CLEANERS?
MARK: UM 
MATT: I'LL GIVE 
YOU A HINT, IT'S
NOT HAT SIZE.
KEVIN MENCH 
WEARS AN 8.
THAT HAS EARNED 
HIM THE NICKNAME
SHREK.
THEY'RE BOTH 
DELAWARE GUYS. 
MARK: OH, YEAH, 
YEAH, YEAH. 
THAT'S RIGHT.
MATT: OUR GUY, 
GORDON?
MARK: THAT'S 
RIGHT.
NOT TOO MANY 
GUYS IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES FROM 
DELAWARE.
MATT: IT'S A 
PRETTY SHORT 
LIST.
I MEAN, ACTIVE 
BIG LEAGUERS, 
YOU KNOW, YOU 
GOT MENCH, 
DESHIELDS, LONG 
SINCE RETIRED.
MARK: WHAT'S 
THEIR NICKNAME?
MATT: SMALL 
STATE YOUR FULL 
NAME AND SPELL 
IT FOR THE 
RECORD 
MARK: THE 
FIGHTING 
PEACOCKS?
MATT: AND WHEN 
THOSE CLOTHES 
GET DIRTY, LOOK 
OUT...
THIS IS A BIG 
DOME.
WHAT SIZE DO YOU
WEAR?
MARK: 7 3/4.
MATT: WHAT DOES 
BOCH WEAR?
MARK: 8 PLUS.
MATT: AND THAT'S
WHAT MENCH 
WEARS.
BRAD WILKERSON 
ON DECK AS 
LINEBRINK IS 
CAREFUL NOT TO 
IGNORE MARK 
DeROSA AT FIRST.
A 2-2 TIE AND 
THIS IS WHERE 
EAVE BEEN SINCE 
THE PIAZZA HOME 
RUN IN THE TOP 
OF THE 6TH.
MARK: DID YOU 
MENTION THE 
STOLEN BASES 
MARK DeROSA HAS 
THIS YEAR?
MATT: I DID.
MENTION IT AGAIN
FOR THE PEOPLE.
MARK: IT'S ONLY 
ONE, FOLKS, BUT 
SOMETHING COULD 
BE ON, HERE.
2, I TAKE THAT 
BACK, 1 TONIGHT.
MATT: IT'S 3-1 
ON MENCH, NOW.
BRAD WILKERSON 
IS DUE UP AND 
HE'LL BE 
LINEBRINK'S 
HITTER.
EMBREE HAS BEEN 
USED FOR ONE 
HITTER TONIGHT.
MARK: THE PACE 
OF THIS GAME HAS
SLOWED DOWN, 
HUH?
MATT: YEAH, IT 
HAS.
AND THAT WILL 
FILL THE COUNT, 
3-2.
ALWAYS THOUGHT 
KEVIN MENCH WITH
HAIR WOULD LIKE 
LIKE KEVIN 
MILAR.
RUNNER GOES ON 
3-2 AND MENCH 
FOULS IT AWAY.
HE'S ANOTHER 
RANGER HITTER 
THAT DOES NOT 
GET CHEATED.
FORGET ABOUT 
SHORTENING UP 
THE 3-2 PITCH.
[CHUCKLES] 
MARK: MENCH 
LOOKS LIKE 
DYNAMO FROM 
RUNNING MAN.
MATT: THAT'S A 
GOOD CALL.
OBSCURE BUT 
GOOD.
RUNNER GOES 
AGAIN A SWING 
AND A MISS, AND 
LINEBRINK SETS 
THE RANGERS DOWN
WITHOUT, IN THE 
8TH.
ON TO THE 9TH.
TIED TWO APIECE. 
MATT: visit 
PADRES.COM, for 
the official 
baseball news, 
Padres on a 
mission.
.
unusual because 
when Trevor 
sanctioned 
"Hells Bells" 
for Aki, I guess
he didn't think 
he would be 
entering to 
that.
MARK: I was 
surprised at 
that, also.
MATT: as fans 
know, Aki did 
not begin the 
season as the 
closer.
after shuffling 
people around, 
they've settled 
in on Akinori 
Otsuka at the 
back of the 
bullpen. it's 
again a good 
decision.
as Mud 
mentioned, he's 
converted in 13 
of his 15 
opportunities 
this year.
Gonzalez gets to
it with a 
lead-off in the 
9th.
there's your 
potential 
go-ahead run to 
lead off inning 
No. 9.
going to have a 
pinch-runner as 
Adrian is lifted
for Ben Johnson.
with a D.H. in 
play, there are 
a lot of things 
that can happen.
there aren't 
constraints as 
far as where 
guys can play.
MARK: right, and
the guys 
remaining on the
bench now for 
San Diego, you 
can scratch 
Bowen off, but 
Blum and Bard, 
Bard had that 
foul tip off his
left foot last 
night.
MATT: nothing-1 
the count to 
Bellhorn, who 
has singled and 
walked.
MARK: you make a
good point, 
Matty, regarding
the American 
league.
every one talked
E.Y. about 
playing in the 
American league.
he said 
collecting a lot
of rust, not a 
lot of A.B. 
aechlts 
MATT: you don't 
find guys 
anxious to go to
American league 
teams as 
F-troopers.
you're not going
to get a lot of 
at-bats, 
comparatively 
speaking, that 
is.
ask Geoff Blum 
about that.
MARK: Blummer 
told us this 
spring, the 
world series, 
before the 
dramatic home 
run he said, you
know what?
I've seen one 
fastball in 
three weeks.
MATT: that was 
his -- it was 
game three of 
the world 
series, extra 
innings, the 
pinch-hit home 
run.
game 4, rather.
no, it was game 
3.
at any rate, 
pretty sure it 
was game 3.
what did Blumme 
tell us?
that was his 
first at-bat in,
what -- 
MARK: 3 weeks.
MATT: was it 3 
weeks?
MARK: yeah.
MATT: 2 balls 
and 1 strike the
count to Mark 
Bellhorn.
dare I say there
is no line up in
baseball more 
familiar with 
Aki than that of
the San Diego 
Padres.
a whole 
different 
experience with 
people behind 
him, however, 
and Bellhorn 
swings ask sends
a high drive to 
right.
Mark DeRosa has 
the play off the
bat and it 
looked like that
was going to get
out farther, 1 
gone.
MATT: have you 
ever purchased a
car from Mossy 
Nissan, the way 
to buy includes 
upfront 
information, use
of the IQ 
computers, 
compares the 
price of a 
vehicle at Mossy
to vehicle 
prices at other 
dealer ships, 
six locations in
San Diego 
county, National
City, say high 
to Tim Howell, 
Mossy Nissan.
here is
Khalil Greene 
with 1 out shs 1
on.
Castilla next, 
should it go 
farther.
anything short 
of a double play
ball and Vinny 
will have an 
at-bat, here.
you know, Aki 
kept his house 
in San Diego.
it was with a 
rather heavy 
heart that he 
was dealt to the
Rangers in the 
off-season.
he still loves 
it in San Diego.
in fact, he and 
his family make 
that their 
year-round home 
still.
kids are out of 
school, we 
understand, and 
heading to 
Arlington this 
week.
MARK: uh-huh.
it was recently 
that Aki blue a 
save and he got 
on the horn and 
talked to Trevor
and he said, 
help me try to 
deal with this.
he said the 
thing is to keep
up your 
confidence and 
turn the page 
MATT: Greene 
lines to left 
center, Johnson 
to second, and 
daying has 
something 
brewing here 
late against an 
old teammate.
MARK: we've seen
the opposition 
pitching against
Khalil Greene 
lately.
he's having with
the breaking 
ball down and 
away.
in the short 
time Merv 
Rettenmund has 
been here, he's 
been working 
with Khalil 
Greene.
he didn't hang 
that, it was a 
good pitch, he 
stayed on it 
nicely and hit 
it to left 
center.
MATT: the second
time tonight 
that San Diego 
has put together
more than one 
hit in an 
inning.
now it's up to 
Vinny, looking 
to convert on 
the 5-game 
hitting streak 
tonight.
0-3 thus far.
that one bounces
away from Laird,
throw gets away 
from Hank 
Blalock.
here comes 
Johnson and San 
Diego takes a 
leave-2 lead.
Greene to third.
did that remind 
you of Friday at
Anaheim?
MARK: good call.
MATT: wow!
same point of 
the night, top 
of the 9th.
Mike tried to 
get a runner in 
Anaheim, and -- 
boy.
this time it was
Laird who tried 
to make an 
all-star caliber
play, that was 
going to be 
awfully close at
third.
MARK: it looked 
like a catchable
ball for Blalock
at third, also.
MATT: so the 
infield in now 
forecast, swing 
and a miss, as 
he goes behind, 
or rather one 
ball, one strike
to Vinny, now.
irony of 
ironies, a run 
scores against 
Aki and now 
Trevor is up for
the bottom of 
the 9th.
MARK: well, we 
heard bells.
doesn't 
necessarily mean
that he has to 
follow those 
bells, right?
MATT: 1-2 to 
Castilla.
swing and a 
miss.
that's one of 
the four or five
Ak sliders 
that's in the 
toolbox.
so 2 Fwaun and 
now Josh 
Barfield, a 
costly throwing 
error hung on 
Gerald Laird 
here as he tried
to get the pinch
runner at third 
that bounce ad 
way from him.
MARK: it would 
be nice to get a
little Esurance,
here, how about 
a 2-out knock?
MATT: Josh takes
a strike.
you know, it's 
one thing when 
the angles, lose
a game, with a 
play like the 
one that 
happened on 
Friday.
it's another 
thing when it 
happens here.
the Rangers are 
a much better 
defensive team.
Aki has Josh 
Barfield 0-2.
slider fouled 
away.
MARK: the last 
game that we 
played in 
Anaheim, the 
angles had 56 
errors.
now the Rangers 
are 42, compared
to the 56 Angel 
errors.
MATT: an 
unrender run, 
Trevor time for 
the second 
straight night.
MATT: for the 
second straight 
night in the 
series, Trevor 
time on the 
road.
tonight Trevor 
looks for save 
No. 18, and, 
again, it's a 
1-run lead that 
he's called onto
protect here in 
Arlington.
MARK: last night
in the 9th it 
was 1, 2, 3 due 
up for the 
Rangers, tonight
the bottom 
third.
it is going to 
be Brad 
Wilkerson, Ian 
Kinsler and 
Gerald Laird, 
due up for the 
Rangers.
MATT: this is 
how the Padres 
reOrient 
defensively.
it will be Blum 
taking over for 
Gonzalez at 
first and the 
man that ran, 
Ben Johnson, 
takes over for 
Young in left.
here we go.
as Mud 
mentioned, 
bottom third of 
the order for 
Texas.
can Trevor 
continue to -- 
continue to make
a 1-run decision
a difficult 
thing for Buck 
Showalter to 
pallet?
here is 
Wilkerson, a 
swing and a miss
at a fastball, 
0-1.
Trevor making 
his 4th career 
appearance here 
in this yard.
MARK: even 
though that was 
first pitch 
swinging, he 
looked like he 
didn't know what
to expect from 
Trevor.
there really 
wasn't the good,
full, 
first-pitch rip.
MATT: just 
missing the 
corners, here, 
2-1.
Brad Wilkerson
has more
experience 
against Trevor 
Hoffman than 
anybody on this 
Rangers roster 
by virtue of his
days in the 
national league,
0-5 with 3 
strikeouts.
3-1 now.
Ian Kinsler next
and then Laird.
fastball right 
Doin the middle 
taken to fill 
the count, 3-2.
MARK: that's 
that pitch 
Trevor can throw
8 out of 10 
times behind in 
the count, when 
needed.
it's that 
4-seamer, hit 
the glove, you 
bet.
MATT: full 
count.
Bowen wants is 
on the corner 
and he stays 
alive.
Oakland and 
Colorado tied 1 
apiece, the 
giants have 
lost, the 
damagerdamage 
dodgers have a 
1-nothing lead 
on the Mariners 
in the third.
and they can 
pick up a full 
game in the 
division tonight
if they can pull
this one out.
MARK: how did 
that miss?
that pitch is 
not low.
MATT: Bill 
Welkie was the 
first base 
umpire last 
night and called
the ball foul 
off the bat of 
Mark Teixeira 
last night.
Ian Kinsler is 
0-3 tonight, 
reached on an 
error and scored
in the 5th.
MARK: almost 100
at-bats for Ian 
Kinsler, he has 
yet to ground 
into a double 
play.
MATT: I like 
where you were 
going with that,
put the Whammie 
on him.
MARK: believe 
it. 
MATT: ball and 
no strikes.
MARK: once 
against, Ian 
Kinsler has yet 
to ground into a
double play this
year.
MATT: got a 
pinch-runner at 
first base, 
Freddy Guzman, 
the former 
Padre, called up
from triple-A 
Oklahoma City 
yesterday to 
replace Kameron 
Loe on the 
roster.
if you missed 
his Padre career
you picked up 
change between 
the sofa 
cushions, though
at one point 
considered a top
perfect.
Greene to 
Barfield, back 
to Blum, what 
was that you 
said earlier?
MARK: he has yet
to ground into a
double play 
until now in the
ninth.
MATT: believe 
it.
2 gone in the 
9th.
MARK: see 
Greenie get rid 
of that hot 
potato?
that's mashed 
garlic right 
there.
MATT: not a bad 
pick by Blummer,
either?
MARK: no.
MATT: that puts 
$100 into the 
coffers by Jack 
in the Box for 
big brothers and
big SistersSisters.
1-1 the count.
the Trevor 
Hoffman family 
can make their 
plans for 
Pittsburgh.
MARK: good call.
I think even the
men of the 
square table 
would agree with
that.
MATT: popped him
up and this 
should do it.
almost 30,000 
with a 
collective Moan,
the type heard 
out of the 
Americas arena 
last night when 
the ma Mavs choked.
how about the 
Padre bullpen, 
combining for 3 
and a third of 
scoreless 
relief, 
finished, as 
always by Trevor
Hoffman, this 
program and this
award approved 
by the men of 
the square 
table, good 
call.
Friars 4-1 on 
the road trip.
win for a 
consecutive 
night tonight.
beer back.
MARK: time for the plays of the 
game, Matty, and they're brought
to you by Murray Lampert 
instruction.
making your remodel seamless.
that's the goal.
100% satisfaction since 1975.
what do you have for me?
MATT: Giles starting the offense
tonight and San Diego had a 
1-nothing lead as Mike Cameron 
came around.
that would hold until the bottom
of the 4th when Mench singled to
score Mark DeRosa, at 1-1 tie 
took us to the top of the 5th, 
or the last of the 5th, rather, 
when Gary Matthews, Junior, 
delivered a sacrifice fly that 
gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
the Padres tied it on a Piazza 
blast in the 6th, and they would
win it with a run in the 9th.
Aki's slider was too much for 
Laird to handle and as he tried 
to cut down Ben Johnson he threw
the ball away, and Johnson 
scored what would be the winning
run and San Diego has taken 
their second straight 1-run 
decision in Arlington, 3-2 
Friars the final score.
we're back after this. 
MATT: final game summary brought
to you by the staying county 
Ford dealers.
see them today. the Padres have
won threeing in a row, it's a 
4-1 trip through the A.L. west.
tonight's victory is for 
Linebrink, with a save by 
Trevor.
Piazza hit No. 406, not to be 
lost was Chris Young's effort, 7
strikeouts pitching into the 6th
inning and, Mud cat, there is 
plenty of sunshining on this 
dog's rear end right now.
MARK: this game boiled down to a
missque, and Kevin Millwood 
tried to keep the Rangers in 
this ball game and it was a bad 
throw to third base that was the
difference.
MATT: Friars willing to bed 
38-33 with at least a 1-game 
least in the national league 
west pending what happens with 
the dodgers, and Mariners 
tonight.
we'll next join you on Friday.
"Outta Left Field" starts at 6 
and game "Prime Time Padres" 
6:30.
and then we'll start the game.
MARK: don't mess with the 
Friars.
MATT: final score, San Diego 
wins, 3-2 Padres.

MARK: WELCOME BACK TO HOT, 
WINDY, STICKY TEXAS AND WE'RE 
GOING TO BE JOINED WITH THE 
MEMPHIS FLASH, BEN JOHNSON AND 
HE PAID DIVIDENDS YESTERDAY, 
BACK TO THE BIG LEAGUES.
GREAT TO BE BACK, I WOULD 
SUPPOSE, BEN, AND THE FIRST 
QUESTION IS THE DIFFERENCES.
YOU'VE BEEN BACK AND FORTH A 
COUPLE OF TIMES.
PSYCHOLOGICALLY HOW DO YOU DEAL 
WITH THAT?
>>BEN: YOU HAVE TO STEP INTO A 
DIFFERENT ROUTINE WHEN YOU GET 
CALLED INTO THE MAJOR LEAGUES.
DIFFERENT BUS TIMES, HITTING 
TIMES, IT DEFINITELY -- THERE IS
A TRANSITION PERIOD.
I KNOW IT HELPS, THOUGH, KNOWING
WHAT TO EXPECT FIRSTHAND.
IT HELPS ME WITH THE TRANSITION,
MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER, I 
GUESS, YEAH.
MARK: THE MINOR LEAGUES IN 
PORTLAND YOU'RE PLAYING EVERY 
DAY.
YOU CAN COME TO THE BALLPARK AND
COME GEARED TO PLAY EVERY DAY.
IN THE BIG LEAGUES HOW DOES THAT
WORK MENTALLY, WHEN YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO?
>>BEN: I TRY TO GET SWINGS IN 
AND WORKING OUT IN THE OUTFIELD.
TODAY I GOT TO THE BALLPARK 
EARLIER, AND BOCH TOLD ME I 
WOULDN'T BE PLAYING, SO CAME 
HERE, GOT A GOOD WORK OUT IN, 
LIFTED WEIGHTS FOR 35, FORTY 
MINUTES, AND YOU CAN MAKE EVERY 
DAY PRODUCTIVE.
MARK: TALK TO ME ABOUT THE TEAM 
IN PORTLAND, HOW IS EVERYBODY 
DOING THERE?
>>BEN: EVERYBODY IS DOING WELL.
BATS ARE STARTED COMING AFRNLTD 
AND WE WERE SCUFFLING A LITTLE 
BIT THERE FOR A WHILE BUT 
THERE'S A GOOD BALL TEAM THERE, 
TOO.
MARK: TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE 
IN THE BATS BETWEEN TRIPLE-A AND
THE BIG LEAGUES.
YOU'VE GOT GUYS COMING UP AND 
VETERANS COMING DOWN.
TALK ABOUT THE SCOUTING REPORT.
IS IT AS ADVANCED AS IT IS HERE?
>>BEN: NO, WAY, A LOOT OF TIMES 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS PITCHING 
THAT DAY UNTIL HE STEPS ON THE 
MOUND.
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
NO VIDEO WORK.
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BALLPARK 
EARL AND EXPECT TO SEE PITCHES 
FROM A GUY.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR NOTES AND 
WORD OF MOUTH IS THE BEST WAY TO
GET A SCOUTING REPORT ON THE 
GUY.
MARK: TALK ABOUT BOCH BECAUSE HE
LIKES TO FILL EVERYBODY IN IN 
THEIR ROLE AND WHAT YOU WERE 
CALLED UP, WHAT DES TO SAY?
>>BEN: WHEN HE PUTS ME IN THERE 
HE WANTS ME TO GIVE IT ALL I 
GOT.
HE'S TOLD ME THAT FROM TIME TO 
TIME, I WANT TO SEE HOW FAST YOU
CAN GO.
HE HASN'T SAID A WHOLE LOT SINCE
EYE BEEN HERE YET.
MARK: TALK ABOUT GROWING UP IN 
MEMPHIS EXAMINE PLAYING HERE IN 
TEXAS IT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE USED
TO.
I KNOW YOU LIKE PLAYING IN SAN 
DIEGO, BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY 
THE BEST WEATHER IN THE UNITED 
STATES, BUT GROWING UP IN THE 
MEMPHIS AREA AND HERE IN TEXAS.
>>BEN: YOU CAN HAVE THE 
HUMIDITY, MARK, AND THERE'S NO 
BETTER WEATHER THAN SAN DIEGO.
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO GET 
LOOSE, HERE, I GUESS, SPRINTS, 
YOU GOT SWEAT GOING, BUT I'D 
RATHER TAKE THE DRY HEAT OVER 
THE HU HEAT.
MARK: BEN, WHEN DO YOU FEEL 
LIKE -- DO YOU HAVE THE SENSE 
NOW THAT YOU'RE LIKE, MAN, THERE
IS A LEARNING CURVE BUT WHEN DO 
YOU GET THAT FEELING THAT YOU'RE
DOING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.
>>BEN: BREAKING CAMP WITH THE 
TEAM I THOUGHT THERE WAS A 
CHANCE THAT I WOULD BE HERE FOR 
THE LONG HAUL, BUT THINGS 
HAPPEN, GUYS GET HURT AND THAT 
AFFECTS ME IN THE CHAIN, YOU 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN, BUT I FEEL 
LIKE I CAN PLAY HERE, I WANT TO 
GET OUT THERE AND GET SOME 
AT-BATS.
DO I BELONG?
I'D SAY SO.
I THINK I'M A MAJOR LEAGUE 
PLAYER.
I TRY TO GO OUT THERE EXAMINE 
PROVE THAT FROM TIME TO TIME.
MARK: YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE 
BENCH TONIGHT BUT THAT DOESN'T 
MEAN YOU WON'T GET AN AT-BAT, A 
GUY LIKE KEFB MILLWOOD, WHAT 
WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO 
PREPARE FOR THE GAME?
>>BEN: I WOULD SEE HOW HE IS 
WORKING ALL THE OTHER 
RIGHT-HANDED HITTERS, MIKE 
CAMERON, MIKE PIAZZA, HOW HE'S 
GOING AFTER THOSE GUYS AND MAKE 
MY APPROACH FROM THERE.
MARK: TALK ABOUT MERV, THE 
HITTING COACH, MERV RETTENMUND, 
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SIT 
DOWN WITH MERV AND GO OVER YOUR 
TENDENCIES?
>>BEN: MERV AND I HAVE SPOKEN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, AND 
BASICALLY HE'S TRYING TO GET ME 
TO SLOW EVERYTHING DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS TRYING 
TO DO THAT'S WORKED WITH ME.
HIM AND I -- I'M LISTENING, AND 
THINGS ARE WORK OUT.
MARK: YOU AND I CROSSED PATHS 
YESTERDAY AND YOU HAD A CUP OF 
COFFEE IN MY HAND.
WHAT DID I SAY TO YOU?
>>BEN: WHAT DID YOU SAY?
MARK: I SAID THAT CUP OF COFFEE 
IS ALWAYS BETTER IN THE MAJOR 
LEAGUES THAN IT IS IN THE MINOR 
LEAGUES.
>>BEN: YEAH, YOU DID, AND 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE.
MARK: MORE COMING UP.

THERE ARE CHANCES YOU CAN GET TO
THE RIGHT HANDER MILLWOOD.
HE'S DEVELOPED INTO A PITCHER AS
HE'S GOTTEN OLDER.
EARL IN THE DAYS HE THREW HARD, 
BUT ALONG WITH THAT FASTBALL 
HE'S INCORPORATED A 2-SEAMER, 
HE'LL CUT THE FASTBALL AND HE 
HAS A CURVE BALL AND A 
CHANGE-UP.
MATT: KEVIN 
MILLWOOD READY 
FOR HIS 16TH 
ASSIGNMENT OF 
THE YEAR, PRICEY
FREE AGENT TO 
THE RANGERS OVER
THE COURSE OF 
THE WINTER.
AND BOCH GOT HIS
900TH WIN LAST 
NIGHT.
YOUNG, CAMERON 
AND GILES SET TO
GO.
MILLWOOD GETS A 
SIGN FROM 
CATCHER GERALD 
LAIRD, AND HERE 
IS OUR FIRST 
PITCH OF THE 
NIGHT.
FASTBALL TAKEN 
FOR A STRIKE.
WE MENTIONED THE
MATCH-UP NUMBERS
THAT FINDER RICK
YOUNG IN THE 
LINE UP TODAY, 
10 FOR 28 CAREER
AGAINST 
MILLWOOD.
TOUGH DECISION 
WITH BOCH 
STARTING WITH 
WHO WOULD HIT 
LEAD OFF AND 
PLAY LEFT FIELD 
TONIGHT, BECAUSE
BEN JOHNSON 
CERTAINLY DID 
NOTHING TO 
DESERVE A NIGHT 
ON THE BENCH 
TONIGHT.
HE HAD A FINE 
EVENING AS YOU 
DISCUSSED WITH 
BENGI IN OUR 
PREGAME 
INTERVIEW, BUT 
TO KEEP THE GUYS
GOING, ERIC 
YOUNG GETS THE 
CALL TONIGHT.
MARK: THAT'S 
WHAT YOUNG IS 
LOOKING FORWARD 
TO, GETTING A 
START TONIGHT.
AND BRUCE BOCHY 
LIKES IT, TOO W 
BECAUSE OF THE 
WEATHER GIVE THE
REGS TIME OFF TO
TAKE A BREAK.
HE HAS MANY 
OPTIONS.
SINCE DAVE 
ROBERTS IS D.L.,
BELLHORN, AND 
SEEING THE GUY 
AT THE PLATE, 
ERIC YOUNG ALONG
WITH MIKE 
CAMERON.
MATT: THE FORMER
RANGER, 1-2.
AFTER THE 
DODGERS, LOST TO
SEATTLE 
YESTERDAY, THE 
PADRES WITH A 
GAME LEAD OVER 
L.A., A GAME AND
A HALF BETTER AN
JOAQUIN ARIAS 
AND COLORADO.
THEY'VE PICKED 
UP A HALF GAME 
ON THE GIANTS IN
THE LAST COUPLE 
OF HOURS AS 
SAN FRANCISCO 
LOST AT HOME IN 
AN AFTERNOON 
START TO THE 
ANGLES.
MARK: MIKE 
THOMPSON DID A 
FINE JOB LAST 
NIGHT.
HE GAVE UP 9 
HITS, 4 RUNS, 
BUT THE PADRES 
DID A NICE JOB 
OF OUTSCORING 
THE RANGERS.
IN THE SCOUTING 
REPORT, WE 
ALWAYS TELL 
PADRES FANS HE'S
A STRIKE 
THROWER.
HE ONLY WALKED 1
RANGER LAST 
NIGHT.
MATT: YOUNG WITH
A LITTLE INFIELD
POP.
AND MICHAEL 
RETIRES ERIC FOR
OUT NO. 1 
TONIGHT.
RANGERS DEFENSE 
BROUGHT TO YOU 
BY KRAGEN.
THEY HAVE GOOD 
ONCE AT THE 
CORNERS, MARK 
TEIXEIRA SHINED 
BRIELTHS 
YESTERDAY AND 
HANK BLALOCK THE
SAN DIEGO 
PRODUCT, THE 
RANCHO BERNARDO 
HIGH, GUY, LAST 
YEAR RECORDED 
THE BEST 
FIELDING 
PERCENTAGE 
AMONGST AMERICAN
LEAGUE THIRD 
BASE MEN.
MARK: THIS IS A 
PRETTY WELL 
ROUNDED TEXAS 
TEAM AND WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT 
BUCK SHOWALTER 
CALLS MARK 
TEIXEIRA THE CON
TEIXEIRA THE 
CONDOR BECAUSE 
OF A COUPLE OF 
NICE PLAYS MARK 
TEIXEIRA MADE 
OVER THERE AT 
FIRST BASE LAST 
NIGHT.
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON HAS NOT 
FAIRED WELL 
AGAINST MILLWOOD
OVER THE YEARS.
IN FACT, HE IS 
ONE OF THE 
VETERANS WHO MAY
HAVE CRINGED 
WHEN THEY SAW 
THIS PITCHING 
MATCH UP EARLIER
IN THE WEEK.
CASTILLA, 
PIAZZA, MIKE 
CAMERON, ALL 
GUYS MILLWOOD 
HAS HANDLED 
QUITE WELL FOR 
THE PAST NUMBER 
OF YEARS.
1-1 THE COUNT TO
MIKE WITH 1 AWAY
AND THE BASES 
EMPTY.
WE'RE JUST 
UNDERWAY IN 
ARLINGTON 
TONIGHT.
MARK: FREE AND 
EASY IS KEVIN 
MILLWOOD.
NICE MOTION OVER
THE RUBBER, GETS
INTO A POWER 
POSITION, HE'S A
BIG BOY, WILL 
COME RIGHT AFTER
YA.
HE HAD A START 
AGAINST THE 
TWINS WHERE HE 
GOT KNOCKED 
AROUND.
THEY SAID IT WAS
A 90-DEGREE IN 
DAY, MAY 9TH, 
ACCORDING TO THE
FOLKS I TALKED 
TO HERE AND THEY
HIT HIM OFF THE 
FIRST CYCLE.
THEY THINK THE 
HEAT MAY HAVE 
DONE SOMETHING 
ABOUT THAT 
OUTING.
MATT: AND MIKE 
CAMERON HIT BY A
PITCH, SO MIKE 
ABOARD THE HARD 
WAY WITH 1 GONE 
TO START THE 
NIGHT.
THAT'S THE 
SECOND PADRE TO 
HAVE BEEN HIT IN
THE SERIES.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
A 2-SEAMER, YOU 
CAN TELL BY THE 
ROTATION OF THE 
BASEBALL. IT 
GETS IN ON HIM A
LITTLE BIT.
GERALD LAIRD WAS
DOWN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE PLATE.
I THINK HE 
WANTED TO POUND 
THE INNER THIRD 
AND IT GOT AWAY 
FROM HIM.
LIKE ANY PITCHER
YOU WANT TO GET 
THAT 1, 2, 3 
INNING UNDER 
YOUR BELT.
NOW HE WILL HAVE
TO WORK OUT OF 
THE STRETCH.
MATT: SEE IF 
MIKE CAMERON 
LOOKS TO RUN.
GILES NOW, IT 
WAS GILES THAT 
WAS HIT BY A 
PITCH YESTERDAY,
ALONG THE COURSE
OF A 1-4 SERIES 
OPENER FOR BRIAN
YESTERDAY.
HE'S HAD A GREAT
ROAD TRIP 
THROUGH THE A.L.
WEST, 8 FOR 17, 
AND NOW WITH 5 
STARTS ON THE 
TRIP.
SEE IF CAM ROON 
LOOKS FOR A 
CHANCE TO RUN, 
HERE.
MIKE IS ONE OF 
THOSE GUYS WE'VE
NOTED IN THE 
PAST THAT HAS 
THAT PHILOSOPHY,
IF YOU HIT ME 
IT'S GOING TO 
COST YOU TWO 
BASES.
MARK: THAT'S A 
DOUBLE.
MATT: THE 
PROBLEM IS 
TONIGHT GERALD 
LAIRD BEHIND THE
PLATE HAS THROWN
OUT 9 OF 15 BASE
STEELERS, THIS 
YEAR 
MARK: THAT'S 60%
AND THE MAJOR 
LEAGUE AVERAGE 
IS ABOUT 32%.
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON STAYS 
PUT, THAT 
BOUNCES AWAY 
FROM LAIRD AND 
CAMERON IS GOING
TO GET THAT BASE
ANY WAY.
SO A RUNNER IN 
SCORING POSITION
NOW.
MARK: GREAT 
REACTION BY 
CAMERON.
AS SOON AS THAT 
BALL WAS IN THE 
DIRT, IT WAS A 
BREAKING BALL 
AND AS SOON AS 
HE SEES DAYLIGHT
THERE HE IS OFF 
AND RUNNING.
MATT: RUNNER AT 
SECOND, STILL NO
DECISION BY THE 
OFFICIAL SCORER 
AS TO HOW THEY 
GET CAMERON OVER
THERE, WILD 
PITCH OR PASS 
BALL AND GILES 
CATCHES INTO THE
GAP IN RIGHT 
CENTER, AND IT'S
ON, SAN DIEGO IS
ON THE 
SCOREBOARD, 1 
OUT INTO THE 
NIGHT AGAINST 
KEVIN MILLWOOD.
A COSTLY, WILD 
PITCH AS WE 
LEARNED IN THE 
EYES OF THE 
OFFICIAL SCORER,
CONTRIBUTES INTO
A RUN SCORING 
START TO THE 9TH
FOR SAN DIEGO.
MARK: IT LOOKED 
EARLY ON LIKE 
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
WAS GOING TO GO 
AFTER GILES 
AWAY.
SOFT STUFF AWAY,
SINKERS, AWAY.
HE WANTED TO GET
THAT ONE IN 
HERE.
IF YOU WANT TO 
COME IN AGAINST 
A GUY LIKE 
GILES, YOU 
BETTER DARN WELL
GET IT IN THERE 
AND TIE HIM UP.
THAT LEAK OVER 
THE HEART OF THE
PLATE AND THE HE
SMOKED IT.
THAT'S A GOOD 
SIGN, MIKE 
CAMERON SCORING 
A RUN, AND HIGH 
FIVE'S ALL THE 
WAY AROUND.
MAYBE IT WILL BE
901 TONIGHT FOR 
BRUCE BOCHY.
MATT: MIKE 
PIAZZA NOW UP TO
THE PLATE, 
TRYING TO PICK 
UP GILES AND GET
HIM IN.
THE LEAD CHANGED
HANDS 3 TIMES 
LAST NIGHT AND 
THIS IS AS CLOSE
AS YOU GET, THE 
KIND OF GAME 
WHERE YOU CAN'T 
COUNT ANYTHING 
DONE UNTIL 
EVERYBODY IS 
SHOWERING.
1-1 TO PIAZZA.
THE RANGERS, BY 
THE WAY, AFTER 
THE SERIES 
OPENER START 
PLAY TONIGHT 
TECHNICALLY TIED
FOR A SHARE OF 
THE WESTERN 
LEAGUE DIVISION 
OF THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE AS 
OAKLAND WAS SHUT
OUT FOR THE 
SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE GAME
IN DENVER 
YESTERDAY.
, AND PIAZZA 
BOCES THAT TO 
YOUNG.
THAT'S OUT NO. 
2.
HAVE YOU LOOKED 
AT IT ON PAPER, 
MUD CAT, JUST IN
TERMS OF 
RECORDS, TEXAS 
38 AND 33, SAN 
DIEGO, 37 AND 
33, BUT THESE 
COULDN'T BE MORE
DIFFERENT TEAMS?
MARK: 
ABSOLUTELY.
PITCH AND GO 
DEFENSE FOR THE 
PADRES, YOU LOOK
AT THE STAFF 
THEY'RE SECOND 
IN THE NATIONAL 
LEAGUE, BUCK 
SHOWALTER'S 
TROOPS, 8TH, 
GIVING UP NEARLY
FIVE RUNS A 
GAME.
TEXAS IS 5TH IN 
DEFENSE IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE,
ALSO.
MATT: HERE IS 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
NOW.
TALK ABOUT 
PADRES HAVING 
GREAT ROAD 
TRIPS.
SWING AND A 
MISS.
ADRIAN WENT DEEP
AGAIN LAST 
NIGHT, 10 ON THE
YEAR, LEADING 
OFF THE SEK.
AND THERE WAS 
LITTLE QUESTION 
THAT THIS WAS 
GOING TO GET 
OUT.
MARK: THAT WAS A
PRETTY SWING.
MATT: EITHER 
YOU'RE PLEASED 
WITH THE 
RESULTS, AND 
GONZALEZ HAS 
BEEN SWINGING 
THE BAT SO WELL 
IN THE MONTH OF 
JUNE, BUT IT'S 
THE SMALL THINGS
THAT LEAD TO THE
GOOD RESULTS 
THAT HAVE BEEN 
PLEASING TO 
BRUCE BOCHY.
MARK: ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT BE 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
TURNING ON THE 
FASTBALL.
YOU KNOW, WE 
KNOW THAT ADRIAN
GONZALEZ, HIS 
STRENGTH IS 
GOING DOWN THE 
LEFT FIELD LINE 
AND SPLITTING 
THE GAP IN LEFT 
CENTER, AND THAT
WAS A GREAT SIGN
LAST NIGHT.
HE GOT A 
FASTBALL, 
MIDDLE, MIDDLE 
IN AND HE TURNED
ON IT.
USUALLY EARL IN 
THE SEASON WHEN 
DE PULL A 
PITCHED BALL?
MATT: BREAKING 
BALL.
MARK: WHEN IT 
WAS A BREAKING 
BALL.
MATT: EVEN ON 
BREAKING BALLS, 
HE WASN'T -- HE 
IS MORE OFTEN 
THAN NOT LOOKING
TO CARVE THAT 
PITCH INTO THE 
OPPOSITE FIELD, 
WHICH IS FINE, 
BUT WHEN YOU 
HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO 
TURN ON A 
BALL -- 
EVERYBODY WAS 
HAPPY TO SEE 
THAT LAST NIGHT.
THERE IS A SWING
AND A MISS TO 
END THE TOP OF 
THE FIRST.
SAN DIEGO IS ON 
THE BOARD, GILES
NOKZ IN A RUN.
1-0 SAN DIEGO.
MATT: 1-NOTHING 
SAN DIEGO AS WE 
GO TO THE HOME 
HALF OF INNING 
NO. 1 AND LOOK 
AT THE RANGERS 
STARTING LINE 
UP.
RICOH BRINGS 
THIS TO YOU.
GARY MATTHEWS, 
YOUNG, MARK 
TEIXEIRA, HANK 
BLALOCK, MARK 
DeROSA, MENCH, 
BRAD WILKERSON, 
KINSLER AND 
GERALD LAIRD 
ROUND THINGS 
OUT.
A NIELT THAT 
CHRIS YOUNG HAS 
LOOKED FORWARD 
TO EVER SINCE HE
LEARN OF THE 
TRADE THAT SENT 
HIM FROM THE 
RANGERS TO THE 
PADRES.
NOBODY HAS BEEN 
BETTER IN TERMS 
OF STARTERS IN 
THE MONTH OF 
JUNE.
CHRIS IS COMING 
OFF A 
NO-DECISION IN A
LOSING EFFORT TO
THE DODGERS, 
MOST RECENTLY 
BUT THAT HARDLY 
BLOCKS WHAT HE 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO
DO OVER THE LAST
FEW STARTS.
MARK: MATTY, 
WE'VE TALKED 
ABOUT THE 
NUMBERS ON THE 
ROAD FOR CHRIS 
YOUNG.
OUTSTANDING.
HE HAS TO STAY 
WITHIN HIMSELF.
HE'S PLAYING 
AGAINST HIS 
FORMER TEAM, 
GUYS GET A 
LITTLE FIRED UP 
TOO MUCH, AND 
THEY START TO 
OVERTHROW TOO 
MUCH, AND 
HOPEFULLY HE CAN
FIND AN EARLY 
GROOVE AND GET 
LOCKED IN, THAT 
TUNNEL VISION TO
WHERE HE IS 
HITTING HIS 
SPOTS AND LOOK 
UP TO WHERE HE'S
DEEP IN THE BALL
GAME.
MATT: GARY 
MATTHEWS, 3-1, 
NOW.
CHRIS ALLOWED A 
COUPLE OF EARNED
YOUNGS IN THAT 
LAST START.
2 EARNED RUNS IN
5 INNINGS OF 
WORK AND THAT 
WAS MORE DAMAGE 
THAN ANYBODY HAD
DONE AGAINST 
CHRIS YOUNG IN 
ABOUT A MONTH.
GARY MATTHEWS 
TAKES A STRIKE 
AND IT'S 3-2, 
FULL COUNT NOW.
HERE IS THE PAY 
OFF HOME.
CHRIS SPENDS A 
LOT OF TIME -- 
HE SPENT A LOT 
OF TIME TODAY 
LOOKING AT VIDEO
OF RANGERS THAT 
HE'S NOT 
NECESSARILY 
FAMILIAR WITH, 
SOME OF THE 
NEWER ADDITIONS 
TO THE LINE UP, 
LIKE IAN 
KINSLER, HERE.
STRIKES OUT GARY
MATTHEWS, 1 
GONE.
THE DEFENSE 
LIKES PLAYING 
BEHIND CHRIS AS 
YOU WORKS FAST
ON THE MOUND AND
THIS IS A LOOK 
AT THE DEFENSE 
ACTIVE UNIT 
TONIGHT BROUGHT 
TO YOU BY 
OCEAN'S 11 
CASINO.
A SIMILAR LOOK 
AS TO LAST 
NIGHT'S OPENER, 
WITH THE 
EXCEPTIONS BEING
PIAZZA CATCHING 
TODAY, AND E.Y. 
IN LEFT FIELD.
BARFIELD GETS A 
REST.
MARK: HE GETS TO
SPEND SOME TIME 
AT HOME WITH HIS
MOM AND DAD IN 
HOUSTON, 
ENJOYING A BIG 
LEAGUE BALL 
GAME, WATCHING 
THEIR SON PLAY 
SECOND BASE.
ONE GONE FOR 
YOUNG, WHO HAD A
COUPLE OF KNOCKS
YESTERDAY, AND 
YOUNG QUICKLY IN
THE HOLE, 0-2.
STARTS WITH 
ALL-STAR 
NUMBERS, .328 
BATTING AVERAGE 
NUMBERS.
MARK: MATTY, YOU
AND I WERE AT 
THE BALLPARK 
TODAY AND I 
ASKED, WHAT DO 
YOU THINK OF 
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
JUST ONE OF 
THOSE QUESTIONS 
THAT YOU WANT TO
HEAR A GUY 
ELABORATE ON, 
AND HE SAID HE 
LIKES THIS GUY, 
HE HAD HIM ON 
TOUR IN JAPAN, 
THE WHOLE 
PACKAGE.
MATT: HE LIKES 
THE PERSONALITY 
AND THE GUY 
INSIDE THE 
UNIFORM, AS WELL
AS THE NUMBERS.
2-2 THE COUNT.
MARK: THIS MIGHT
BE A CASE OF -- 
I'M NOT GOING TO
PUT WORDS IN 
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
MOUTH, BUT 
FIRST-INNING 
JITTERS, MAYBE 
NOT TRUSTING HIS
STUFF, GOING 
AFTER GUYS HOOR 
HERE EARLY ON.
MATT: IT WAS A 
PITCH COUNT THAT
GOT IN CHRIS 
YOUNG'S WAY 
AGAINST THE 
DODGERS, LAST 
WEEK AT HOME AND
HE WAS ONLY ABLE
TO GO FIVE 
INNINGS IN THAT 
ONE.
IT'S A GAME THAT
THE DODGERS, 
SALVAGED IN THE 
SERIES TO GET 
OUT OF THERE 
WITH ONE WIN.
A SLIDER THAT 
MISSED, 3-2.
MARK: I THINK 
THAT'S BEEN A 
GREAT PITCH FOR 
CHRIS YOUNG THE 
LAST 5, 6, MAYBE
7 STARTS.
BOTH TO RIGHTIES
AND LEFTIES.
MATT: FULL TO 
THE SECOND 
STRAIGHT BATTER 
TO START THE 
BALL GAME.
THAT'S BEEN THE 
DIFFERENCE FOR 
CHRIS IN TERMS 
OF HIS EVOLUTION
FROM A FLY BALL 
PITCHER TO A GUY
THAT CAN PUNCH 
PEOPLE OUT, 
RECORD OUTS ON 
THE GROUND, AND 
THIS IS NOT THE 
GUY THAT THE 
RANGERS WATCHED 
PITCH FOR AN 
ENTIRE YEAR HERE
IN 2005.
MARK: I THINK 
ONE OF THE 
REASONS WHY 
CHRIS YOUNG HAS 
GROWN INTO THE 
PITCHER THAT 
WE'VE SEEN AS A 
PADRE, HE'S 
TRUSTING MORE OF
HIS 4-SEAMER.
REMEMBER, HERE 
IN TEXAS THE 
BALL HAS A 
TENDENCY TO FLY.
A LOT OF 
PITCHING COACHES
MIGHT SAY, OH, 
YOU GOT TO GO TO
A TWO-SEAMER, 
WE'VE GOD TO 
WORK GROUNDERS, 
GROUNDERS, 
GROUNDER IS, AND
YOU FORGET ABOUT
THE FACT THAT HE
CAN THROW THE 
BALL 90, 92 
MILE-PER-HOUR.
MATT: SINGLED IN
TO LEFT FIELD.
CURIOUS TO LOOK 
AT THAT AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW IF 
THAT WAS A 
SLIDER THAT HE 
MISSED WITH.
IT WAS A 
FASTBALL.
MARK: YEP.
IT'S GOOD 
LOCATION, THAT'S
ONE OF THOSE 
SITUATIONS WHERE
MICHAEL YOUNG 
HAS TO PROTECT, 
RIGHT?
HE GOES DOWN TO 
GET IT.
HE'S SO FAR BACK
HE HOLDS HIS 
HANDS, THERE, TO
KEEP THEM BACK.
HE FOUND A HOLE 
ON THE LEFT SIDE
THERE FOR A BASE
KNOCK.
MATT: SO A 1-OUT
BATTER AS THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
SECOND STARTS 
OUT IN SIMILAR 
FASHION AS TO 
SAN DIEGO'S 
RUN-SCORING TOP 
OF THE FIRST.
AND NOW MARK 
TEIXEIRA 2 FOR-5
YESTERDAY, 
NUMBERS THAT ARE
DOWN 
SUBSTANTIALLY 
FROM LAST YEAR.
THE 
SWITCH-HITTER 
TEIXEIRA, AND 
THEN THE 
LEFT-HANDED HANK
BLALOCK UP NEXT.
HE DOESN'T GET 
CHEATED UP 
THERE, DOES HE?
A BIG SWING ASK 
A MISS.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE THAT UPPER 
CUT, THAT 
AGGRESSIVE 
SWING.
ONE BALL, NO 
STRIKES, WHAT 
KIND OF A SWING 
ARE YOU GOING TO
TAKE?
OH YEAH!
I LOVE THAT.
HOW MANY PEOPLE 
DID YOU TALK TO 
TODAY, MATTY, 
THAT THOUGHT 
THAT BALL WAS 
FAIR OFF THE BAT
OF TEIXEIRA LAST
NIGHT?
MATT: FUNNY THE 
WAY THAT BROKE 
DOWN, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE AT THE 
BALLPARK THOUGHT
THAT BALL WAS 
FAIR AND OTHERS,
THOSE THAT WORK 
HERE THAT HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN
BASEBALL FOR A 
LONGER TIME, 
LESS KNEE-JERKY,
THEY AGREED WITH
US, THEY DIDN'T 
THINK IT WAS 
ANYTHING BUT 
FOUL FROM THE 
MOMENT IT LEFT 
THE BAT.
MARK: TREVOR 
SAID HE WAS 
SURPRISED THE 
BALL DIDN'T HOOK
MORE THAN IT 
DID.
FROM HIS VANTAGE
POINT HE 
COULDN'T SEE HOW
IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN FAIR.
HE THOUGHT IT 
WAS FOUL.
MATT: YOUNG RUNS
AND TEIXEIRA 
BOUNCES IT TO 
SECOND BASE, 
THEY STAY OUT OF
THE DOUBLE PLAY 
BY STARTING A 
RUNNER, AND THEY
GET TEIXEIRA ON 
A GROUND BALL.
MARK: THAT BALL 
WAS HIT HARD.
IF HE HITS THAT 
BAUM 10 FEET 
EITHER SIDE OF 
JOSH BARFIELD, 
THERE IS A 
CHANCE THAT BALL
SQUEAKS THROUGH.
HE HIT IT HARD, 
BUT YOU KNOW 
WHAT, CHRIS 
YOUNG HIT THE 
SPOT AND MUSER 
ALIGNING THE 
DEFENSE THERE IN
THE INFIELD.
THERE'S TONY 
MUSER.
MATT: SO NOW 
HANK BLALOCK, 49
RUNS BATTED IN 
LEAD THE 
RANGERS, 2 FOR-5
WITH AN RBI 
YESTERDAY, HE'S 
TRYING TO PICK 
UP YOUNG AT 
SECOND BASE WITH
2 GONE, AND HE 
TAKES A STRIKE.
MARK: FIRST 
PITCH BREAKING 
BALL.
PIAZZA WENT OUT 
AND HAD A CHAT 
WITH YOUNG 
BEFORE BLALOCK 
GOT INTO THE 
BOX, AND HE 
SAID, HEY, LET'S
PUT SOMETHING ON
THIS GUY.
MATT: THAT'S 
PART OF THE 
LUXURY OF THE 
3-CATCHER 
EQUATION, IS 
THAT, YOU KNOW, 
BY THE TIME YOU 
GET THROUGH THE 
5 STARTERS, THE 
GUYS IN THE 
BULLPEN, THERE 
IS GOING TO BE A
CATCHER THAT 
EVERYBODY LIKES.
BIG SWING AND A 
MISS.
BOY, THEY ARE UP
THERE HACKING.
MARK: GRIP IT 
AND RIP IT.
YOU SAW MARK 
TEIXEIRA, HANK 
BLALOCK FROM THE
LEFT SIDE, ALSO.
BIG GUY, BIG 
SWING.
ONCE IN A WLE 
THEY'RE GOING TO
RUN INTO ONE.
MATT: SO NOTHING
AND 2 ON HANK 
BLALOCK, MARK 
DeROSA NEXT.
THE 0-2 PITCH IS
POPPED FOUL, 
THAT WILL BE OUT
OF PLAY.
WHEN WE GOT TO 
THE BALLPARK 
TODAY AND LOOKED
OVER THE 
STARTING LINEUP 
FOR SAN DIEGO, 
YOU NOTICE 
PIAZZA CATCHING 
BECAUSE WE WERE 
ALL UNDER THE 
ASSUMPTION THAT 
HE WAS GOING TO 
D.H. THE ENTIRE 
ROAD TRIP.
BRUCE BOCHY TOLD
US THERE ARE A 
COUPLE OF THINGS
WORKING HERE, 
BARD STILL 
TENDER, AND HE 
HOPES TO HAVE 
BARD TOMORROW, 
BUT HE WANTED 
MIKE CATCHING AT
LEAST ONE DAY ON
THE TRIP SO AS 
NOT TO GET 
COMPLETELY RUSTY
BEHIND THE 
PLATE.
SO A GOOD 
OPPORTUNITY, 
TODAY, WITH BARD
A LITTLE BANGED 
UP, AND BOCH 
WANTING MIKE TO 
GET SOME WORK 
BEHIND THE PLATE
TO HAVE MIKE 
CATCH CHRIS 
YOUNG, AND CHRIS
LIKES WORKING TO
MIKE, TO MAKE IT
EVEN A BETTER 
FIT TONIGHT.
NO SWING BY 
BLALOCK ON THE 
APPEAL, 2-2.
MARK: FIRST BASE
IS OPEN SXUFSHGS
A RIGHT HANDER 
ON DECK, MARK 
DeROSA, YOU 
MIGHT SEE 
ANOTHER BREAKING
BALL HERE, MAYBE
BACK DOOR OR 
DOWN AND IN TO 
BLALOCK.
MATT: [CHUCKLES]
UP AROUND THE 
LIPS.
I'M TELLING YOU 
THESE GUYS DO 
NOT GET CHEATED 
AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S AMAZING, 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE OFFENSIVE 
NUMBERS THE 
RANGERS PUT UP, 
YOU WOULD THINK 
THEY PUNCH OUT 
LIKE FREAKS, YOU
WOULD THINK THEY
WOULD LEAD THE 
LEAGUE IN 
PUNCH-OUTS, NOT 
THE CASE.
THEY'RE AMONG 
TRAILERS, IN 
STRIKEOUTS IN 
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE.
AGGRESSIVE, YET 
DISCIPLINED.
MARK: YEAH.
MATT: IF THERE 
CAN BE SUCH AN 
ANIMAL.
ON 2-2 AGAIN.
AND A DIVE AND A
SMATER BY 
BARFIELD, HERE 
GOING TO WAVE 
YOUNG AROUND.
MARK: TAG HIM, 
TAG HIM, TAG 
HIM, MIKE, GO 
TAG THE RUNNER.
MATT: HOME PLATE
UMPIRE FILLED 
MIKE IN AS HE 
APPLIES THE TAG.
MARK: YES, SIR.
MATT: I WOULD 
LOVE TO BE A FLY
ON THE WALL IN 
THE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN WILKIE 
AND PIAZZA.
TAKE A LOOK AT 
IT AGAIN.
NEVER TOUCHED 
THE PLATE.
HOW DID THAT GO 
AGAIN?
MATT: SOMEBODY 
GET MARK CUBAN 
ON THE PHONE, 
MORE CONTROVERSY
FROM A SPORTS 
TEAM FROM 
DALLAS.
WE'LL LOOK AT IT
AGAIN.
MARK: YOUNG 
THINKS HE TAGS 
THE BACK POINT 
OF HOME PLATE, 
AND QUITE 
HONESTLY, I 
THINK THE PADRES
CATCH A BREAK, 
YOU SEE IT, HIS 
HAND COVERS IT.
MATT: NO, NO, HE
MISSED THE 
PLATE.
YOU'RE BEING A 
REVERSE HOMER.
LOOK, WATCH.
HE MISSES IT, 
MARK.
MARK: NO, I 
THINK HE GOT IT.
MATT: THIS IS 
WHERE IT GETS 
INTERESTING.
PIAZZA, HE 
ASSUMES THAT 
YOUNG TAGGED THE
PLATE.
MEANWHILE 
BELLHORN LEADS 
THINGS OFF AND 
THEN IT GOT FUN.
WHEN MIKE WANTED
TO PUT THE TAG O
WATCH THE MOVE.
THIS IS, AGAIN, 
THE MISSED TAG, 
YOUNG THINKS HE 
TOUCH THE PLATE.
WATCH THE MOVE.
THIS IS FROM 
MIKE'S STREET 
ROOTS PLAYING 
PICKUP 
BASKETBALL.
[CHUCKLES] WHAT 
WAS THAT 
SHOULDER MOVE HE
PUT ON HIM?
MARK: THAT WAS 
FUNNY.
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND A STRIKE, 
THE COUNT TO 
BELLHORN LEADING
THINGS OFF IN 
THE SECOND.
MARK: YOU KNOW, 
WHEN A TEAM IS 
GOING GOOD, YOU 
GET THOSE CALLS,
RIGHT?
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: ONCE 
AGAIN, I THINK 
THE UMPIRE WAS 
BLOCKED.
HE COULDN'T SEE 
WHERE HIS HAND 
WAS TOUCHING 
HOME PLATE.
MATT: UN, AFTER 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
SLID, HE ALMOST 
GAVE HIMSELF UP 
BY TURNING BACK 
TO LOOK AT THE 
UMPIRE.
I THINK.
BELLHORN LINES 
INTO RIGHT.
AND HE STOPS 
AROUND FIRST, 
WISELY SO, AS 
MARK DeROSA GOT 
ON IT QUICKLY.
A LEAD-OFF BASE 
HIT IN THE 
SECOND.
MATT: WATCH 
YOUNG AFTER THE 
PLAY, I'M SAFE, 
RIGHT?
RIGHT?
LITTLE CUP CHECK
THERE, AND 
MARK: AND HE 
KNOWS HE'S GOING
TO BE TAGGED, 
BUT HE'S GOING 
TO TALK TO THE 
UMPIRE, LIKE, 
"DUDE, WHAT'S UP
WITH THAT?"
MATT: I LOVE 
THAT MOVE.
HERE IS KHALIL 
GREENE WITH 
BELLHORN ABOARD.
GREENIE 
YESTERDAY 1-4.
AND A FASTBALL 
STARTS HIM WITH 
A STRIKE.
MARK: THAT'S A 
WAY TO HANG HIM,
MATTY.
MATT: A PAIR OF 
CONTROVERSIAL 
CALLS YESTERDAY 
IN THE 9TH.
WOUN A GROUND 
BALL OUT OFF THE
BAT OF GARY 
MATTHEWS, AND 
THEN, OF COURSE,
THE HOME RUN OR 
FOUL BALL CALL 
THAT WAS 
CONTESTED BY THE
RANGERS.
I THINK THE 
COWBOYS OPEN IN 
JACKSON VILLE 
THIS YEAR AS 
GREENE GROUNDS 
TO THIRD, HANK 
BLALOCK TO IAN 
KINSLER, BACK TO
TEIXEIRA, NO 
CONTROVERSY ON 
THAT ONE, SCORE 
IT 5 TO 4 TO 3 
AND THERE ARE 2 
GONE IN THE 
SECOND.
MARK: PITCHERS 
KNOW WHEN 
THEY'RE ON THE 
MOUND AND YOU 
HAVE GUYS 
STRUGGLING, YOU 
TRY TO THROW 
QUALITY PITCHES 
AND TAKE THE 
STING OUT OF THE
BAT.
HE TRIED TO 
FORCE THAT AND 
PULL THAT BALL, 
KHALIL DID, AND 
HE HIT IT FOR 
THE DOUBLE PLAY.
MATT: SO 2 GONE 
NOW FOR THE RED 
HOT VINNY 
CASTILLA, 3 FOR 
4 YESTERDAY.
WHERE WAS I 
GOING WITH THAT,
YESTERDAY, YOU 
ASKED?
THE COWBOYS, 
OPENING IN 
JACKSON
JACKSON
JACKSON
JACKSONVILLE?
LET'S SEE IF IT.
O. IS INVOLVED 
IN A 
CONTROVERSIAL 
CALL COIN TO SAY
OR SOMETHING.
SO AS WE TALKED 
ABOUT, WHEN WE 
WENT ON THE AIR,
VINNY CASTILLA 
WHO HAS GOTTEN 
RED HOT HERE IN 
JUNE, WE LEARNED
TODAY IN 
SPEAKING WITH 
BRUCE BOCHY THAT
VINNY WAS HOURS 
AWAY FROM 
BECOMING A BENCH
PLAYER.
WHEN HE STARTED 
TO GET HOT AND 
REALLY WHEN 
PEOPLE TOOK 
NOTICE IN 
ANAHEIM, BOCH 
HAD A 
CONVERSATION 
WITH VINNY AND 
TOLD HIM, I GOT 
TO MAKE A 
CHANGE, BELL 
MORE THAN IS 
GOING TO BE OUR 
THIRD BASEMAN, 
AND VINNY SAID, 
WHAT IF I GET A 
COUPLE OF HITS 
TODAY?
AND HE SAID WELL
>> 1-NOTHING SAN
DIEGO AS WE GO 
TO THE BOTTOM 
HALF OF INNING 
NO. 2.
CHRIS YOUNG GOES
BACK TO WORK, HE
GETS MARK 
DeROSA, MENCH 
AND BRAD 
WILKERSON AS HE 
GOES TO WORK.
MARK DeROSA HA 
THREE SINGLES IN
YESTERDAY'S 
RANGER LOSS TO 
OPEN THE SERIES.
1 BALL AND 1 
STRIKE.
SUCH A GREAT 
TURNAROUND FOR 
MARK DeROSA THIS
YEAR AS A 
RANGER.
A GOOD PLAYER 
DURING HIS TIME 
IN ATLANTA, BUT 
NEVER WITH THE 
KIND OF NUMBERS 
EVEN CLOSE TO 
WHAT HE'S IN THE
MIDST OF NOW.
DIGGING IN, 
HITTING .343 AS 
YOU SAW A MOMENT
AGO.
MARK DeROSA'S 
PREVIOUS HIGH A 
.297 AVERAGE 
OVER 72 GAMES, 
HIS FIRST REAL 
TASTE OF BIG 
LEAGUE PITCHING 
WITH THE BRAVES 
IN 2002.
BIG HACK AND A 
MISS, 3 BALLS 
AND 2 STRIKES.
MAN!
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT?
THAT'S THE KIND 
OF HACK YOU 
WANT, 3-1.
YOU GET A 
FASTBALL, SURE, 
IT'S OUTER THIRD
AND IT'S UP, 
TRYING TO CARVE 
THAT BALL THE 
OTHER WAY OR 
WHATEVER.
MATT: STRUCK HIM
OUT.
MARK: GOT HIM 
OFF BALL AND OUT
OF THE BOX AFTER
SWINGING OFF 
BALL.
MATT: SECOND OF 
THE GAME FOR 
CHRIS YOUNG.
THE A'S COME TO 
TOWN STARTING 
THE 27TH.
TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY'S 
GAMES ARE AT 
7:05 AND 
THURSDAY'S AT 
12:35, CHECK OUT
PADRES.COM.
MARK: I HERE 
CAMPY HAS BEEN 
SWINGING A HOT 
BAT.
MATT: YEAH, AND 
HE BILLY NORTH 
AT THE TOP OF 
THE A.'S ORDER.
HERE IS MENCH 
NOW, YESTERDAY, 
0 FOR 4.
HE HAS HAD MUCH 
MORE SUCCESS 
WHEN STARTING IN
RIGHT FIELD AS 
OPPOSED TO 
STARTING AT D.H.
MEN
MENCH GETTING 
THE CALL 
TONIGHT, AND -- 
MARK: THIS GUY 
WILL HIT 20 PLUS
HOME RUNS, 
PRETTY MUCH MARK
IT DOWN.
IF HE STAYS 
HEALTHY.
MATT: YOUNG 
BEHIND HIM 3-0.
CHRIS HAS FALLEN
BEHIND NOW 5 OF 
THE FIRST 6 
HITTERS THAT 
HE'S FACED 
TONIGHT.
AND HE LOSES HIS
FIRST OF THE 
BALL GAME, 
THERE'S MENCH, 
WALK NO. 1.
CHRIS WALKED 3 
AGAINST THE 
DODGERS ON 
THURSDAY.
3 WALKS IS HIS 
SEASON HIGH, 
HE'S DONE THAT 
ON A HANDFUL OF 
OCCASIONS THIS 
YEAR.
SO FOR THE 
SECOND STRAIGHT 
INNING THE 
RANGERS HAVE A 
1-OUT BASE 
RUNNER TO WORK 
WITH.
NOW IT'S THE 
LEFT HANDER, 
BRAD WILKERSON.
WILKERSON WAS 
AMONG THOSE THAT
CHRIS YOUNG WAS 
TRYING TO 
FAMILIARIZE 
HIMSELF WITH 
BEFORE THE GAME 
TONIGHT AS BRAD 
WILKERSON IS IN 
HIS FIRST YEAR 
AS A RANGER.
HE AND CHRIS 
WERE NEVER 
TEAMMATES, SO 
THE 13 HOME RUNS
AND WITH A 
STROKE THAT'S A 
BY THE 
UNFAMILIAR TO 
C.Y., CHRIS WAS 
PAYING ATTENTION
TO HIM ON VIDEO 
BEFORE THE GAME.
MISSED THE 
CORNER THERE, 
2-0.
MARK: YOU 
MENTIONED LAST 
NIGHT THAT BRAD 
WILKERSON 
STRIKES OUT A 
LOT, SO A 
PITCHER TAKES 
THAT INTO 
CONSIDERATION.
HE'S FALLEN 
BEHIND, 2-0, 
WILKERSON IS 
SHOWING 
PATIENCE, HERE, 
AND HE KNOWS HE 
WILL CHASE OUT 
OF THE STRIKE 
ZONE, ESPECIALLY
WITH 2 STRIKES.
HE IS GETTING 
THERE QUICKLY.
MATT: OUT OF 
STRETCH WITH 
MENCH ABOARD.
A SWING AND A 
HIGH FLY BALL 
INTO RIGHT FIELD
FOR GILES.
THAT'S OUT NO. 
2.
FIRST TIME 
THROUGH THE 
ORDER, AND THE 
RANGERS ARE 
TAKING SOME BIG 
SWINGS AGAINST 
CHRIS YOUNG 
TONIGHT.
MARK: AND, YOU 
KNOW, HERE AT 
ARLINGTON, THE 
FLIES ARE GOING 
STRAIGHT IN WITH
SOME AUTHORITY.
YOU WOULD THINK 
BY THESE HACKS, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
WIND HERE AT THE
BALLPARK, BE WAW -- 
BEWARE FOR THE 
WIND AT THE 
BALLPARK AND 
HANG ONTO YOUR 
HAT.
MATT: THERE'S A 
STRIKE TO START 
THE AT-BAT WITH 
IAN KINSLER.
CHRIS HAS THROWN
42
42 PITCHES AND 
BE NOT YET 
COMPLETED WITH 2
INNINGS.
THAT PITCH COUNT
MAY STAND IN THE
WAY OF A LONG 
START.
MARK: HE NEEDS A
6 OR 8-PITCH 
INNING.
MATT: BULLPEN 
GOT A LOT OF 
WORK YESTERDAY, 
AND FOR SAN 
DIEGO, AFTER THE
DAY OFF MONDAY, 
A WE WILL-RESTED
BULLPEN WAS 
UTILIZED.
5 GUYS PITCHED 
AFTER THE 
STARTER 
YESTERDAY.
MARK: BOCH TODAY
IN THE OFFICE 
SAID EVERYONE IS
GOOD TO GO.
AFTER HIS 900TH 
WIN LAST NIGHT.
WALKED INTO HIS 
OFFICE, THERE 
WAS A BASEBALL 
SITTING ON HIS 
DESK.
TREVOR HOFFMAN, 
WHO USUALLY 
KEEPS HIS SAVE 
BALLS, HE 
COLLECTS THEM, 
EACH AND EVERY 
SAVE?
AFTER THAT BALL 
GAME, TREVOR 
HOFFMAN MARKED 
IT UP WITH 900TH
VICTORY AND 
PRESENTED IT TO 
MANAGER BRUCE 
BOCHY.
MATT: THAT'S 
NEAT.
MARK: VERY NICE.
BOCH WAS VERY 
IMPRESSED.
MATT: TELL YOU, 
I MEAN, TREVOR 
IS VERY MUCH 
AWARE THAT HE 
HAS BOCH TO 
THANK FOR A LOT 
OF HIS CAREER 
SUCCESS.
MENCH RUNS.
IT'S LINED INTO 
THE SEATS FOUL.
TREVOR COMING 
OFF INJURY AND 
BOCH HAVING ALL 
THE CONFIDENCE 
IN THE WORLD IN 
HIS CLOSER.
YOU KNOW, WHAT 
TOTALS GET TO BE
AT THE POINT 
WHERE TREVOR'S 
ARE, THERE HAS 
TO BE A 
RELATIONSHIP 
WITH MANAGERS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE THAT 
MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES IF
MANAGERS AREN'T 
CONFIDENT IN 
YOU.
BIG SWING ASK A 
FOUL BALL.
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT, TREVOR GOT
THE SAVE LAST 
NIGHT, FOR HIS 
17TH, AND THAT'S
GOOD NEWS FROM 
THE SKIPPER THAT
HE'S GOOD TO GO 
AGAIN TONIGHT.
GAVE UP A HIT 
LAST NIGHT AND 
THAT WAS IT.
MATT: THE 
ANGLES, BEAT THE
GIANTS EARLIER 
THIS AND A 
COUPLE OF OTHER 
GAMES BEGIN 
SHORTLY, SEATTLE
AT L.A., ONE OF 
THOSE.
WE'LL CONTINUE 
TO KEEP OUR EYES
ON THOSE.
BY MY UNOFFICIAL
COUNT THIS IS 
THE 4TH FULL 
COUNT AGAINST 
CHRIS YOUNG IN 8
BATTERS FACED.
MENCH RUNS ON 
3-2 AND IT'S 
FOULED BACK.
MARK: HE'S GOING
TO THROW 50 
PITCHES IN 2 
INNINGS.
MATT: AND SHUT 
OUT INNINGS.
MARK: I WAS 
GOING TO SAY 
FROM AN 
OFFENSIVE 
STANDPOINT FROM 
TEXAS I HAVEN'T 
SEEN ONE GUY TRY
TO CARVE THE 
BALL THE 
OPPOSITE WAY.
EVEN WITH THE 
RUNNER GOING 
RIGHT THERE, 2 
OUTS.
YOU KNOW?
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS, STRIKE 
3, NO CARVING 
TONIGHT.
3 PUNCH-OUTS BY 
THE EX-RANGER.
MATT: TAKE A 
GUIDED BEHIND 
THE SCENES TOUR 
OF PETCO PARK, 
OFFERED ON 
SUNDAYS
SUNDAY TUESDAY 
THROUGH SUNDAYS,
VISIT 
PADRES.COM.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
GOES BACK TO 
WORK, 1-NOTHING 
FRIARS, AND JOSH
BARFIELD HAS 
BEEN SITTING 
AROUND WATCHING 
THESE BIG HACKS 
AND SAYS "I WANT
ME UN."
MARK: DO YOU 
THINK IT'S 
PSYCHOLOGICAL, 
SOME GUYS SEE 
THAT AND GET UP 
THERE AND GET 
FROGGY?
DO YOU THINK IT 
CARRIES OVER A 
LITTLE ABOUT?
MATT: WHY NOT?
SURE.
JOSH BEHIND, 
0-2.
BALL AND 2 
STRIKES TO JOSH 
BARFIELD.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
KNOWS WHAT IT'S 
LIKE TO MAKE 
GUYS SWING AND 
MISS.
HE HAS STRUCK 
OUT 66 ON THE 
YEAR, ONLY 17 
WALKS AND HE 
ANNUALLY HAS 
GOOD STRIKEOUT 
TO WALK NUMBERS.
MISSES HIGH 
AGAIN, SO 2-2 
NOW AFTER BEING 
BEHIND NOTHING 
AND 2 TO 
BARFIELD.
LAST YEAR KEVIN 
MILLWOOD WON 
ONLY 9 GAMES AND
I SAY "ONLY" 
BECAUSE HE LED 
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE IN 
E.R.A., .2E.R.A.E.E.R.A.
E.R.A., 2.86.
HE IS AN ACTIVE 
BIG LEAGUER TO 
HAVE 
ACCOMPLISHED 
THAT AREAEST OF 
HITTING
HIT FETING FEATS, 
NO-HITTERS, BACK
IN PHILLY.
IT'S INCREDIBLE,
THERE HAVE BEEN 
NO NO-HITTERS, 
JOHNSON'S '04 
BEING THE MOST 
RECENT.
MARK: REALLY?
MATT: YEAH.
ACCORDING TO 
"CHYRON BOB" 
WEHRSDORFER.
YOUNG THROWING 
TO FIRST TO 
RETIRE ERIC 
YOUNG BY A STEP.
IT'S THE SECOND 
TIME E.Y. HAS 
GROUNDED OUT TO 
HIS NAME SAKE 
AND ON THAT 
OCCASION IT WAS 
VERY CLOSE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE HOW MICHAEL 
YOUNG, THE 
SHORTSTOP, ONCE 
HE GETS THIS 
BASEBALL, AND 
THEN HE KNOWS HE
HAS TO GEAR UP 
THE ARM, LOAD UP
THAT HOSE, BANG!
GOT HIM BY WHAT,
MAYBE A FOOT?
THAT'S A NICE 
PLAY.
MATT: SO NOW 
MIKE CAMERON 
WITH 2 GONE AND 
THE BASES EMPTY.
YOU KNOW HOW 
WHENEVER A GUY 
THROWS A 
NO-HITTER ON 
THAT RARE 
OCCASION, IT 
GIVES THE STATS 
PEOPLE THE 
NUMEROLOGIST, 
THE TRIVIA 
FANATIC 
PARTICULARSES
PARTICULARS -- 
FANATIC 
PARTICULARS, 
THEY SINK THEIR 
TEETH INTO IT.
MATT: THE LAST 3
PITCHERS, TO 
NO-HIT THE 
GIANTS, ALL 
NAMED KEVIN.
KEVIN BROWN, 
KEVIN MILLWOOD, 
AND KEVIN 
JOHNSON.
BOTH OF THEM 
AGAINST THE 
GIANTS.
TERRY 
MULLHOLLAND DID 
THE FIRST.
THAT'S THAT 
JASON STARK 
STUFF THAT COMES
OUT THAT WE, 
FRANKLY LOVE.
MARK: IT'S GOOD 
STUFF.
DOES HE LABEL 
THAT AS USELESS 
INFORMATION?
MATT: THAT'S 
RIGHT.
MARK: IT'S GOOD 
STUFF.
MATT: SAN DIEGO 
SCORING ON AN 
RBI BY GILES IN 
THE FIRST.
MARK: CHRIS 
YOUNG HAS 
PITCHED WELL, 
BECAUSE KEVIN 
MILLWOOD WHEN 
HE'S OUT THERE 
STARTING FOR 
TEXAS HE IS 
GETTING 5 AND A 
HALF RUNS OF 
SUPPORT, SO 
FIRST TIME 
THROUGH THE LINE
UP, LOOKS LIKE 
CHRIS YOUNG HAS 
DONE EXTREMELY 
WELL.
MATT: FULL COUNT
NOW, 3-2.
TALKING ABOUT 
THE DEAL THAT 
BROUGHT MILLWOOD
OVER FROM 
CLEVELAND IN THE
OFF-SEASON, 
RANGERS WERE 
THRILLED TO BE 
ABLE TO POACH 
THE REIGNING REIGNER REIGN LEADER
IN THE FIELD.
MARK: BEAUTIFUL 
APPROACH.
TALKING ABOUT 
MAKING 
ADJUSTMENTS, 
OPPOSITE SIDE OF
THE PLATE, NOT A
LOT OF UPPER 
BODY MOVEMENT, 
HE JUST THREW 
THE HANDS THAT 
WAY.
WE'VE SEEN HIM A
FEW THEMS THIS 
ROAD TRIP GOING 
TO RIGHT CENTER 
FIELD AND TO 
RIGHT CENTER 
SAFELY.
MATT: SO NOW 
BRIAN GILES WITH
A RUNNER ABOARD.
SEE IF CAMERON 
LOOKS TO STEAL A
BASE HERE.
MIKE, AFTER 
BEING HIT BY A 
PITCH ADVANCED 
ON A WILD PITCH 
IN THE FIRST.
CAMERON HAS ONLY
BEEN THROWN OUT 
ONCE ALL YEAR 
AND THAT WAS 
SATURDAY IN 
ANAHEIM.
GILES IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE GAMES ONLY 
RUN THIS FAR 
WITH AN RBI 
DOUBLE AND THAT 
HIT LIKE A SHOT 
A FAIR BALL INTO
THE RIGHT FIELD 
CORNER, CAMERON 
TO THIRD.
THAT BALL WAS 
ABSOLUTELY 
SMOKED.
GILES HAS A 
LAUGH ABOUT IT.
MARK: JUST OUT 
OF THE REACH OF 
TEIXEIRA, AND 
NEARLY HITTING 
FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE TIM 
MCLELLAN.
A 2-OUT KNOCK 
FOR THE FRIARS.
THAT'S A 
DANGEROUS AREA 
WHEN YOU THROW 
THAT BREAKING 
BALL DOWN AND 
INTO THE 
LEFTIES, THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR IT.
MATT: SO NOW BIG
OPPORTUNITY FOR 
PIAZZA, RUNNERS 
AT THE CORNERS 
WITH 2 GONE.
MIKE BOUNCED OUT
TO SHORTSTOP IN 
HIS FIRST TRY 
TONIGHT.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
VERY QUIETLY HAS
AMASSED A RATHER
HIGH PITCH 
COUNT.
BOUNCED TO HANK 
BLALOCK AND 
MILLWOOD WILL 
ESCAPE THIS JAM.
NOTHING COMES OF
BACK-TO-BACK 
TWO-OUT SINGLES,
1-NOTHING SAN 
DIEGO.
MATT: WE GO TO 
THE BOTTOM HALF 
OF INNING NO. 3 
AND TAKE A LOOK 
AT OUR ESURANCE 
COMPARISON OF 
THE GAME 
TONIGHT.
QUOTE AND 
COMPARE 
INSTANTLY AT 
ESURANCE.COM.
TAKE A LOOK AT NUMBERS OF 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA.
IT'S A SURPRISE 
THAT ADRIAN IS 
OUTSLUGGING AND 
OUTHOMERING A 
GUY THAT BEAT UP
ON THE BIG 
LEAGUES LAST 
YEAR.
MARK: YEAH, HE 
SPLIT TIME BEING
HURT IN TEXAS
AND 38 HOME 
TEIXEIRA PROVED 
HE CAN PUT UP 
SERIOUS S -- OH MY
GOSH, WHAT 
HAPPENED THERE?
MATT: GOT IN THE
WIND AND ADRIAN 
DIDN'T HAVE A 
PLAY ON IT.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
TO GERALD LAIRD,
YOU'LL HAVE 
ANOTHER CHANCE 
IN AN 0-1 COUNT.
MARK: ADRIAN 
ANTICIPATED THAT
BALL BEING HIT A
LITTLE FARTHER.
HE NEEDS TO GO 
DOWN A BY THE TO
GET THAT BALL UP
TO ADRIAN.
MATT: POPPED IT 
UP AGAIN.
SEE WHAT THE 
WIND DOES TO 
THIS BALL.
BARFIELD HANGS 
WITH IT TO MAKE 
THE CATCH.
MARK: TELL YOU 
WHAT, THIS IS 
CANDLESTICK-LIKE
, HUH?
HAVE TO KEEP 
YOUR FEET 
MOVING.
MATT: WE TALKED 
ABOUT IT 
YESTERDAY.
IT SEEMS TO 
CHANGE 
DIRECTIONS NOT 
BY THE INNING, 
NOT BY THE 
AT-BAT, BUT BY 
THE PITCH.
HERE IS GARY 
MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR, NOW, 
STRUCK OUT IN 
THE FIRST.
YOU KNOW, JASON 
STARKS-TYPE 
STUFF, YOU TALK 
ABOUT GARY 
MATTHEWS AND HIS
FATHER, SENIOR, 
THEY TALK ABOUT 
JUNIOR, SON OF OF 
SENIOR.
JERRY
ENGINEER JERRY 
HAIRSTON IS 
HERE, SON OF 
JERRY SENIOR AND
GRANDSON OF 
JERRY.
CHET LEMON -- AS
THAT BALL IS 
FOULED AWAY, THE
GREAT TIGER AND 
WHITE SOX, HIS 
SON MARCUS WAS 
THE RANGERS'S 
FOURTH-ROUND 
PICK THIS PAST 
JUNE, A COUPLE 
WEEKS AGO.
IF YOU GET INTO 
A TIME CAPSULE 
FOR A FEW YEARS 
AND GOT OUT OF 
IT AND YOU SAW 
LEMON, MAYBERRY,
JERRY HAIRSTON 
AND GARY 
MATTHEWS, YOU 
WOULD THINK 
THOSE GUYS WERE 
HAVING 
INCREDIBLE 
CAREERS INTO 
THEIR 50s.
2 BALLS, 2 
STRIKES TO GARY.
GOT 'EM 
SWINGING.
MARK: YOU THINK 
THIS TEAM SYSTEM
A HIGH, 
FASTBALL-HITTING
TEAM?
YOU BET.
RIGHT AT THE 
LETTERS, JUNIOR 
HAS TO PROTECT.
MATT: THAT'S THE
FIRST STRIKEOUT 
FOR CHRIS THAT 
HASN'T COME IN A
FULL-BLOWN HACK.
MARK: I WAS JUST
GOING TO SAY 
THAT. THAT'S 
THE FIRST 
DEFENSIVE SWING 
I THINK TONIGHT 
BY THE RANGERS.
MATT: SO NOW 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
WITH 2 GONE.
MARK: NICE.
MATT: 1-1.
CHRIS IS EN 
ROUTE TO WHAT 
WOULD BE HIS 
LOWEST PITCH 
COUNT INNING.
THAT WAS PITCH 
NO. 12 HERE IN 
THE THIRD.
MARK: WHAT ELSE 
DO YOU NOTICE 
ABOUT WHY UNG 
YOUNG SECOND 
TIME AROUND 
AGAINST THESE 
RANGERS?
ONE THING I 
NOTICE HE'S 
THROWING MORE 
SLIDERS, AND 
DROPPING THE 
HAMMER A LITTLE 
MORE, ALSO.
TAKE A LOOK AT 
THE BREAKDOWN, 
61 PITCHES, 62.
SLIDER ON THE 
HALF SHELL 
MATT: THAT'S THE
WEAPON NOW IN 
CHRIS' ARSENOL 
THAT HE DIDN'T 
HAVE AS A 
RANGER, SO YOU 
CAN UNDERSTAND 
IF THE RANGERS 
ARE CONFUSED BY 
THAT.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE THE FRONT 
SIDE OPEN UP ON 
YOUNG, THERE?
MATT: THE 2-2.
UP AND IN WITH A
FASTBALL, FULL 
COUNT, NOW.
VERY FINE LINE 
BETWEEN TRYING 
TO OUTTHINK YOUR
OPPONENT AND 
OUTTHINKING 
YOURSELF, AND 
CHRIS SEEMS TO 
HAVE WALKED THAT
LINE WELL 
TONIGHT.
MARK: HE HAS TO 
BE SHORT AND 
QUICK, FOR THE 
HITTER.
AND HE WAS ON 
THAT FASTBALL 
INSIDE.
MATT: ALMOST GOT
IT UP TO THE HER
MET
HERMETICALLY-
SEALED WINDOW, 
UP HERE TONIGHT.
THEY ONLY OPEN 
IT UP FOR FOOD, 
THEN THEY'LL 
CRANK IT OUT 
REAL FAST.
2-2 TO MARK 
TEIXEIRA.
TO YOUNG, 
RATHER.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
STANDING ON DECK
NEXT.
NO TV TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON.
THIS ROAD TRIP 
CONCLUDES WITH 
AN 11 A.M. SAN 
DIEGO START TIME
TOMORROW EXAMINE
THEN BACK HOME 
FOR THE MARINERS
ON FRIDAY.
THIS WAS GOING 
TO BE CHRIS 
YOUNG'S QUICKEST
PITCH COUNT 
INNING.
THIS WILL BE THE
9TH PITCH OF THE
AT-BAT ON ITS 
WAY TO MICHAEL 
YOUNG.
IN THE AIR AND 
SLICING INTO THE
CORNER.
OUT OF PLAY.
MARK: THAT BALL 
WASN'T FAR FROM 
STAYING FAIR AND
HITTING THAT 
FAIR POLE OUT 
THERE.
MATT: YOU KNOW, 
THE ANGLE WE SEE
DOWN THERE, WE 
SEE THE CORNER 
IT CUTS AND IT 
SAYS 349 AND AS 
YOU MENTIONED, 
THERE IS A 
PADDING THERE 
AND THE WALL 
SHOOTS IN A 
LITTLE BIT.
THE WAY THE 
BALLS TRAVEL 
RIGHT FIELD IN 
THE SERIES, IT 
ALMOST SEEMS 
LIKE IT'S 330 
DOWN THERE.
TRY IT AGAIN.
LINED TO THIRD 
AND VINNY GOB 
BELLS IT UP FOR 
THE FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
YOUNG GETS THE 
RANGERS IN 
ORDER, STILL 1-0
SAN DIEGO.
MATT: 1-NOTHING 
SAN DIEGO AS WE E TOP 
HALF OF INNING 
NO. 4 BACK WITH 
MARK GRANT, MATT
VASGERSIAN, 
PADRES SCORING A
RUN IN THE 
FIRST, AND T 
LEAD HAS HELD SO
CHRIS 
YOUNG.
HE ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ LEADING
THINGS OFF IN 
THE VISITOTH.
YOU KNOW,
WERE T 
TODAY WITH OUR
ASSOCIATE 
PRODUCER "CHYRON
BOB" 
WEHRSDORFER, AS 
TARTED 
RUNNING DOWN 
ACTIVE BIG 
LEAGUERS, FROM 
SAN DIEGO.
WE STARTED TO 
THINKING ABOUT 
THAT'S A GOOD 
OULD 
PUT TOGETHER.
AS GONZALEZ 
SPRAYS TO CENTER
FIELD FOR 
MATTHEWS.
AND DOING IT OFF
THE TOP OF YOUR 
HEAD AS "CH
BOB" WEHRSDORFER
DID IN ABOUT 3 
MINUTES, THIS 
ISN'T EVERYBODY 
BUT THIS IS THE 
KIND OF TEAM YOU
COULD PUT 
TOGETHER IF YOU 
WANT TO TAKE 
GUYS WHO HAVE 
THEIR ROOTS IN 
SAN DIEGO AND 
PUT THEM ON THE 
FIELD TOGETHER.
FIRST OF ALL 'S A HECK OF A
STAFF, PRIOR AND
HARANG, THIRD 
BASE WE PUT 
PEREZ THERE BUT 
YOU COULD PUT 
HANK BLALOCK ON 
THERE, TOO.
MARK: SURE.
MATT: WE HEAR A LOT, ESPECIALLY 
WHEN YOU COME TO
TEXAS, OF TEXANS
IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES.
YOU KNOW, 
YESTERDAY 
JENNINGS SHUT 
OUT THE A. 
SXAESHGS THEY 
STARTED OFF BY 
SAYING, BAYLOR 
GRAD AND SUCH 
AND SUCH HIGH 
SCHOOL, JASON 
JENNINGS SHUTS 
OUT THE A.'S.
MARK: HOW ABOUT 
DARREN BALSLEY 
LEADING T
PITCHING STAFF 
AS COACH.
MATT: SURE.
STRIKE TO 
BELLHORN TO MAKE
IT 1-2.
HOW ABOUT THE 
COACH, JOHN 
CATERRA?
MARK: NICE.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS, 
STRIKEOUT FOR 
MILLWOOD.
THIRD OF THE 
GAME FOR HIM.
LET'S TAKE A 
LOOK AT OUR 
AFLAC TRIVIA 
QUESTION TONIGHT
AS WE CONTINUE 
TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE
FACT THAT WE'VE 
GOT SOME RANGER 
HISTORY TO 
DISCUSS, A 
UNIFORM WE DON'T
SEE OFTEN 
THROUGH THE 
COURSE OF THE 
REGULAR SEASON.
TONIGHT WE ASK 
"WHICH RANGER 
PITCHER STARTED 
A GAME 22 DAYS 
AFTER BEING THE 
CLUB'S FIRST 
ROUNDER IN 
1973?"
HERE IS KHALIL 
GREENE.
SPEAKING OF 
FIRST-ROUNDERS, 
A FLY BALL TO 
RIGHT FOR MARK 
DeROSA.
IT'S THE 
QUICKEST OF 1, 
2, 3 INNINGS FOR
KEVIN MILLWOOD.
MATT: 1-NOTHING 
SAN DIEGO, WE GOE BOTTOM 
HALF OF THE 4TH 
AND A
AFLAC T 
QUESTION.
THE PITCHER
STARTED THE GAME
HERE FOR
RAS 
OFF BEING A

AFTER CLYDE WON 
A FEW GAMES, CKED A FEW 
HOUSES, BUT THE
STORY DIDOT 
HAVE A HAPPY 
ENDING, 
NECESSARILY, HE 
PITCHED HERE FOR
THREE YEARS AND DONE.
Y TALK ABOUT 
RUSHING A GUY, 
THAT BEC ERB, TO DAVID 
CLYDE SOMEBODY 
WAS TO RUSH 
SOMEBODY TO THE 
BIG LEUES.
MARK: I REMEMBER
HEARING STORIES 
OF HIM THROWING 
140, 150 PITCHES
A GAME, THEY 
JUST LEFT HIM 
OUT THERE.
MATT: THE 
CONSENSUS 
OPINION BY THE 
BASEBALL PEOPLE 
WAS HE WASN'T 
READY, BUT OWNER
WANTED A 
IONAL POP,
AND THEY BLEW 
THE KID OUT.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
LEADS THINGS OFF
IN THE 4TH, 
TEIXEIRA, 
BLALOCK AND MARK
DeROSA FOR THE 
RANGERS.
THOSE EARL DAYS 
OF THE RANGERS 
ARE CHRONICLED 
IN WHAT IS STILL
ONE OF MY 
PERSONAL 
FAVORITE 
BASEBALL BOOKS 
EVER WRITTEN AND
I'M REMISS FOR 
NOT RECALLING 
THE NAME OF THE 
AUTHOR, BUT HE 
WAS A FORMER 
BEAT WRITER THAT
FOLLOWED THE 
RANGERS IN THEIR
EARLY DAYS WHEN 
THEY CAME HERE 
FROM WASHINGTON 
AND RELOCATED AS
THE SENATORS TO 
THE RANGERS, THE
NAME OF T BOOK
IS CALLED 
"SEASONS IN 
HELL" AND IT 
DOCUMENTS THE 
FIRST TWO YEARS 
OF RANGERS 
HISTORY REPLETE 
WITH STORIES OF 
GUYS BABYINGING 
CURFEW AND ALL 
THAT FUN, OFF 
FIELD STUFF 
THAT WE'VE COME 
TO EXPECT IN 
SPORTS STUFF.
SWING AND A MISS
FOR TEIXEIRA, 
AND THAT'S 
STRIKEOUT NO. 5 
FOR CHRIS YOUNG 
TONIGHT.
MARK: HOW WAS HE
GOING TO MISS 
THAT?
THAT'S A GOOD 
FASTBALL DOWN 
THE MIDDLE OF 
THE PLATE.
YOU CAN GET HURT
THERE MANY 
TIMES.
NOT THAT TIME.
MATT: SO NOW 
HANK BLALOCK, 2 
FOR 5 YESTERDAY,
AND HE'S SINGLED
TONIGHT.
USE USED TO 
IMITATE TONY 
GWYNN AS A KID.
HANK HAS SAID HE
WAS NEVER A BIG 
GUY GROWING UP, 
AND HE'S FILLED 
OUT AS A MAJOR 
LEAGUER, BUT AS 
A SMALL GUY THAT
WASN'T ABLE TO 
GRIP IT AND RIP 
IT, HE LEARNED 
HOW TO CARVE AND
HIT LIKE TONY 
GWYNN.
INTO LEFT 
CENTER, CAMERON 
CALLING OFF 
YOUNG TO MAKE 
THE CATCH.
MARK: THERE WE 
GOT CHANNEL 4 
FANS, MATTY.
MATT: THAT 
CLEARLY GOT THE 
CHECK YESTERDAY,
THAT GUY.
MARK: THE AKIMAS
THAT LIVE IN 
TEXAS, FAMILY 
LIVES IN 
OCEANSIDE.
I GOT THE LETTER
RIGHT HERE, HI 
FROM BETH 
MARSHALL, YOU 
PEOPLE OUT IN 
OCEANSIDE.
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THAT, 
MATTY?
MATT: THINK IT'S
GREAT.
HERE IS MARK 
DeROSA NOW WITH 
2 GONE.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT
OF PADRE FANS 
HERE IN THIS 
SERIES.
MARK: DID YOU 
GET YOUR LETTERS
SENT YOUR WAY?
MATT: NO.
IT'S OKAY.
MARK: I DIDN'T 
THINK SO.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND NO STRIKES 
THE COUNT TO 
MARK DeROSA.
MATT: INTO RIGHT
CENTER, CAMERON 
HAS TO MOVE AND 
IT GETS UP AND 
OVER HIS HEAD, 
MARK DeROSA 
ROUNDING INTO 
SECOND BASE.
HAVING A HECK OF
A SERIES, HERE.
INCH YOU KNOW, 
WE'VE TALKED 
ABOUT HOW THE 
BALL TRAVELS 
HERE IN RIGHT 
CENTER FIELD.
IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE ROUTE FOR 
MIKE CAMERON, I 
DON'T THINK HE 
ANTICIPATED THAT
BALL GOING OVER 
HIS HEAD.
HE THOUGHT HE 
HAD A BEAD ON 
THAT, AND THAT 
BALL WAS HIT 
HARDER THAN MIKE
THOUGHT.
YOU CAN SEE MIKE
SMILING THERE 
AND SHAKING HIS 
HEAD.
MATT: TAKE A 
LOOK AT THE 
SWING BY MARK 
DeROSA, AND 
WATCH HOW SOFT 
HE IS ON THE 
FRONT FOOT.
KEPT ALL OF HIS 
WEIGHT BACK 
THERE AND THOSE 
ARE AMONG THE 
ADJUSTMENTS THAT
HE HAS MADE WITH
RUDY JARAMILLO, 
THE FINE BATTING BATTING BATTING
INSTRUCTOR HERE.
THE RANGERS ARE 
PROUD OF WHAT 
HE'S 
ACCOMPLISHED.
MARK: THE HARD 
LANDING MESSES 
EVERYTHING ELSE 
ON YOUR BODY, 
MATTY.
MATT: NOTHING-1 
THE COUNT TO 
MENCH.
APPARENTLY MARK 
DeROSA USED TO 
DIVE A LOT.
AND HE WOULD GET
CAUGHT OUT HIS 
FRONT FOOT AND 
THAT WOULD MAKE 
HIM VULNERABLE 
INSIDE AND 
PITCHERS WOULD 
FIND IT EASY TO 
BUST HIM IN, AND
THE RESULTS ARE 
GREAT, HITTING 
.345.
MENCH SLICES A 
FLY BALL INTO 
THE RIGHT FIELD 
CORNER.
1-2.
MENCH LINES UP 
THE MIDDLE, AND 
HERE COMES MARK 
DeROSA WITH THE 
TYING STRIKE.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MATT: A 2-OUT 
RANGER RALLY 
EVENS THE SCORE 
AT 1 APIECE.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
MARK DeROSA AND 
MENCH AND THEIR 
APPROACH THE 
LAST TIME UP 
JUST SHORTENED 
UP A LITTLE BIT.
THIS BALL IS A 
HIGH, HANGING 
CUTTER OR A 
SLIDER, AND YOU 
CAN SEE YOU 
CAN'T TAKE THAT 
BIG HACK.
HE CUT BACK, AND
BOTH GUYS CUT 
BACK ON THEIR 
APPROACH.
MATT: THE INNING
STARTED OUT 
INNOCENTLY 
ENOUGH, HANK 
BLALOCK LINED 
OUT, MARK 
TEIXEIRA LINED 
OUT, THAT WAS 7 
IN A ROW, THEN 
MARK DeROSA'S 
DOUBLE, MENCH 
SINGLES HIM HOME
AND WE'RE BACK 
AT 1 APIECE.
0-1 TO BRAD 
WILKERSON.
A BIG SWING ASK 
A MISS THERE.
NOTHING-2.
BRAD WILKERSON 
WILL PUNCH OUT.
HE LEADS BIG 
LEAGUE BASEBALL 
WITH 84 
STRIKEOUTS ON 
THE YEAR.
AND HE IAN 
KINSLER IAN 
KINSLER THE 
SECOND BASEMAN, 
NEXT.
THAT WAS THE 
KIND OF PITCH 
YOU THROW WHAT 
YOU WANT A NEW 
BASEBALL, AND 
YOU CALL TIME.
MARK: I'M 
SURPRISED THEY 
CALLED A 
PITCH-OUTRIGHT 
THERE.
MATT: MENCH 
RUNS, THEY 
SMELLED 
SOMETHING BUT IT
DOESN'T MATTER 
AS BRAD 
WILKERSON SWINGS
AND MISSES, IT'S
STRIKE 3.
MARK: THAT'S WHY
BECAUSE HE'S 
VULNERABLE TO 
THE STRIKEOUT.
MATT: RANGERS 
TIE IT.
NOT TOO CLOSE; WHATTA YA' THINK
I GOT THAT INSURANCE ?
WHAT INSURANCE
IS THAT YOGI ?
AFLAC.
[ Duck grunts ]
THE ONE YA' REALLY
NEED TO HAVE...
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED IT.
NEED WHAT ?
AFLAC.
WELL, IF YOU GET HURT
AND MISS WORK IT WON'T HURT
TO MISS WORK.
HUH ?

PITCHING COACH, 
BUT ALSO YOUR 
DEFENSE.
WE TALK ABOUT IT

YOU WANT A GUY 
TO BE AROUND THE

WE'RE TIED AT 2.
HERE FOR CHRIS 
YOUNG AND THE 
PADRES, AFTER 
THE 108TH SPICH 
A QUICK INNING 
HERE IN THE 6TH,
KEEP IT TIED SO 
HE CAN BE THE 
PITCHER OF

HOPEFULLY THE 
PADRES THE NEXT 
HALF OF THE 
INNING CAN ADD 
ON AND HAVE THAT
MAN, THE BIG, 
6-10 RIGHT 
HANDER GET THEM 
TO VICTORY.
MATT: 2-2 TO

PREMIERE POWER 
GUY IS HURTING A
BY THE.
MARK: OH, MY.
MATT: HE 
DISCARDED THE 
BAT THINKING IT 
WAS 0-4, HE'LL 
HAVE A SLICE OER 
CRACK.
MATT: WE TALKED 
ABOUT THE 
DROP-OFF BETWEEN
LAST YEAR AND 
THIS FOR MARK 
TEIXEIRA.
BATTING AVERAGE 
IS A WASH AND IN
THE SAME NUMBER 
OF AT-BATS AFTER
71 GAMES THE 
REAL DIFFERENCE 
COMES WITH 
POWER.
20 HOME RUNS AT 
THIS POINT OF 
THE SEASON LAST 
YEAR, AND ONLY 6
AS WE STAND 
TODAY.
MATT: 3-2.
DRAMATIC UPPER 
CUT ON THAT 
SWING AS HE POPS

RIGHT FOR JOSH 
BARFIELD.
1 GONE.
KEEP 'EM QUIET.
BE SURE TO TUNE 
INTO A BRAND NEW
EDITION OF "SAN 
DIEGO INSIDER" 
TONIGHT.
SOME SAY MIRAMAR
IS THE ANSWER 
FOR THE AIRPORT,
BUT THE MILITARY
SAYS NO.
WILL JOINT USE 
WORK?
SOME SURPRISING 
ANSWERS ON THE 
ISSUE ON "SAN 
DIEGO INSIDER 
MAGAZINE."
RIGHT AFTER THE 
GAME TONIGHT.
HANK BLALOCK 
WITH 1 GONE NOW.
TALKED ABOUT IT 
EARLIER, THE 
FACT THAT HANK 
BLALOCK GREW UP 
WATCHING TONY 
GWYNN AND HIS 
SWING.
YOU COULD FILL 
OUT A TEAM OF 
CURRENT BIG 
LEAGUERS WHO 
INITIAL WATCHING
OF SWINGS CAME 
FROM WATCHING 
TONY GWYNN.
MARK: HEY, LOOK 
AT THAT?
CHRIS YOUNG 
FINISHES UP IN A
NICE FIELDING 
POSITION AND 
MAKES THE SNAG.
MATT: LOOK AT 
THAT.
HE'S AN ATHLETE,
NOW.
UP TO 116 
PITCHES, HERE, 
AND WITH 2 GONE 
HE'LL GO TO WORK
ON MARK DeROSA, 
A GUY WHOSE 
GIVEN EVERYBODY 
TROUBLE THIS 
SERIES, 4 FOR 6.
GOTTA FIGURE, 
MUD CAT THAT 
WITH THE PITCH 
COUNT GETTING TO
1200, CHRIS 
YOUNG WILL NOT 
BE BACK.
MARK: YEAH, AND 
THAT'S WHY I WAS
SAYING.
JOHN ADKINS, LOW
CARB THERE IN 
THE PADRE 
BULLPEN.
MATT: 0-2 TO 
MARK DeROSA.
MARK: I THINK HE
MIGHT DROP THE 
HAMMER ON HIM 
RIGHT HERE.
NO, HIGH HEAT.
MATT: BALL AND 2
STRIKES.
MENCH NEXT, IN 
FACT, THE 5 AND 
6 SPOTS HAVE 
BEEN PRODUCTIVE 
FOR THE RANGERS 
TONIGHT.
AND THE 1-2.
ANOTHER HIGH 
FASTBALL FOULED 
BACK.
YOUNG'S NUMBERS 
IN THIS BALLPARK
LAST YEAR WERE 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
THAN HIS OVERALL
NUMBERS.
WHETHER THAT HAD
ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH THE FACT 
THAT THE RANGERS
THOUGHT HE WAS 
EXPENDABLE OR 
NOT, WE DON'T 
KNOW.
HE HAD A 4.86 
E.R.A. HERE LAST
YEAR AND OF HIS 
31 STARTS 20 OF 
THEM CAME IN 
THIS BALLPARK.
THE GUY WON 12 
GAMES AND TWHA 
TIED A ROOKIE 
RANGER'S RECORD.
MARK: I HEARD 
THAT THE PADRES 
WERE INTERESTED 
IN GERALD LAIRD,
THE CATCHER, BUT
THEY WANTED TO 
HANG ON TO HIM, 
BECAUSE HE'S THE
FUTURE FOR THEM 
IN CATCHERS, THE
NEXT YEARS, AND 
THAT'S WHEN 
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
NAME CAME UP AND
THEY JUMPED ON 
THE DEAL.
MATT: 2-2.
MARK: PRETTY 
GOOD PITCH.
MATT: THERE WAS 
YOUR HANK BAUER 
PITCH RIGHT 
THERE.
THAT'S WHAT WE 
WERE TALKING 
ABOUT, 12 WINS 
BY A ROOKIE 
PITCHER, A SHARE
OF THE FRANCHISE
RECORD WITH 
KEVIN BROWN AND 
EDWIN CORREA.
THERE'S BALL 4, 
HE LOST MARK 
DeROSA.
MARK: I THOUGHT 
HE HAD HIM WITH 
THAT BREAKING 
BALL.
MATT: HERE COMES
DARREN BALSLEY 
AND IT'S 
GENERALLY, AS WE
KNOW, A 
CONVERSATION 
WHEN DARREN 
BALSLEY COMES 
OUT AND A MOVE 
WHEN WE SEE 
BOCH, SO THIS 
WILL BE HOW DO 
YOU FEEL, DO YOU
WANT ONE MORE 
GUY?
MARK: LOOKING AT
THE BODY 
LANGUAGE OF 
CHRIS YOUNG, IT 
REALLY DOESN'T 
LOOK LIKE HE'S 
LABORING THAT 
MUCH, HE THREW A
NICE BREAKING 
BALL, COULD HAVE
BEEN EASILY 
CALLED STRIKE 3.
HE DID NOT GET 
THE CALL.
HE THREW A 
FASTBALL DOWN 
AND AWAY.
THE LEGS MIGHT 
BE GETTING 
HEAVY.
IT WOULD BE 
TOUGH TO GET IN 
THAT POINTING 
DOWN POSITION, 
EXACTLY WHERE HE
WANTS THE BALL.
MATT: KEVIN 
MENCH WALKED AND
SINGLED IN A RUN
TONIGHT.
MARK: YOU KNOW, 
I THINK THIS 
COMES DOWN TO A 
MOVE BRUCE BOCHY
WANTS -- HE 
WANTS TO HAVE 
CHRIS YOUNG GET 
THE VICTORY.
DON'T YOU THINK?
MATT: THERE GOES
MARK DeROSA ON 
THE FIRST PITCH 
AND THE SHOT 
FOULED.
I WOULD AGREE, I
THINK THAT'S THE
MOTIVATION FOR 
GIVING THE GUY 
THE CHANCE TO 
FINISH THE 
INNING.
ABSOLUTELY.
MARK: THE FIRST 
PITCH FASTBALL, 
THE RUNNER WAS 
GOING, BUT MENCH
CAN'T CATCH UP 
WITH IT, FOULING
IT OUT OF PLAY.
MATT: AT 125 
PITCHES, THIS IS
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
DEEPEST PITCH 
COUNT OF THE 
YEAR.
AND DARE I SAY 
THAT -- OR 
DIDN'T CHAN HO 
HAVE A START 
EARLIER WHERE HE
WENT 127, 131?
MARK: HE MAY 
HAVE.
MATT: THERE'S 
THE FORMER 
RANGER.
YOU KNOW, BOTH 
OF THE DEALS THE
PADRES HAVE 
WORKED OUT WITH 
TEXAS HAVE 
WORKED OUT 
PRETTY GOOD.
MARK: SURE.
MATT: OKAY FOR 
BOTH TEAMS, BUT 
REAL GOOD FOR 
SAN DIEGO.
MARK: REMEMBER 
ADAM EATON HAD 
THAT ADAM EATON 
SURGERY.
REMEMBER, WE 
TALKED ABOUT THE
SURGERY WITH 
ADAM HIMSELF IN 
FRONT OF THE 
DUGOUT THE OTHER
DAY AND WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT 
TAKING THE 
LIGAMENT OUT OF 
ONE ARM AND PUT 
IT GO IN HIS 
FINGER AND THE 
HIRSHISER 
SURGERY WAS THE 
ELBOW SURGERY, 
AND I DUBBED IT 
THE ADAM EATON 
SURGERY.
MATT: BOCH DID 
EVERYTHING HE 
CAN TO LET CHRIS
YOUNG FINISH THE
6TH, AND THEN A 
MISS REPLY A 
HARD HIT BALL 
AND THAT'S GOING
TO BE IT FOR 
C.Y.
HE COULDN'T WAIT
ANY LONGER.
HE HAD JOHN 
ADKINS UP P & IT
LOOKS LIKE 
EMBREE IS UP OUT
OF THE BULLPEN.
EVERYTHING IS 
ALWAYS ON SALE 
AT MOTOWORLD.
WE'LL BE BACK.
MATT: STILL A 
2-2 SDPIE CHRIS 
YOUNG FINALLY 
REMOVED.
BOY, AS WE 
MENTIONED A 
MOMENT AGO, BOCH
DID EVERYTHING 
HE COULD TO LET 
HIM FINISH THE 
INNING BUT HE 
ENDS WITH 7 
STRIKEOUTS 
TONIGHT.
MARK: HE WAS 
GOING UP THE 
LADDER, AND 
WE'VE SAID SINCE
GAME 1 OF THIS 
SERIES, THEY 
LIKE THE HIGH, 
FASTBALL.
OCCASIONALLY HE 
WOULD DROP A 
BREAKING BALL, 
THE SECOND AND 
THIRD TIME 
AROUND.
THAT WAS A 
BREAKING BALL 
RIGHT THERE.
A GREAT EFFORT, 
GOOD BIG LEAGUE 
OUTING FOR THE 
RIGHT HANDER.
AND NOW THEY'LL 
GO THE OTHER 
SIDE AND ALAN 
EMBREE WILL TRY 
TO END THIS.
MATT: HE WAS ONE
OF 5 PADRE 
RELIEVERS TO GET
INTO THE BOX 
SCORE LAST 
NIGHT.
HE WENT 2/3RD'S 
OF AN INNING.
HIS JOB IS 
SIMPLY TO GET 
THIS MAN AND 
FINISH THIS LAST
OF THE 6TH.
RERZ GO, FIRST 
PITCH TAKEN FOR 
A STRIKE.
HOW ABOUT THAT 
CALL?
MARK: GUTSY, 
YES.
YOU BETTER MAKE 
SURE THAT YOU 
CAN GET THOSE 
BAGS.
LOOK AT THE WAY 
THE DEFENSE IT 
PLAYING.
IT LOOKED LIKE 
CASTILLA WAS 
PLAYING BACK, 
THEY'RE LOOKING 
FOR HIM TO PULL,
THE INFIELD IS 
BACK.
MATT: MARK 
DeROSA WITH JUST
HIS SECOND 
STOLEN BASE AND 
MEFRJ IN HIS 
FIRST ATTEMPT OF
THE YEAR.
THAT CAUGHT 
EVERYBODY BY 
SURPRISE.
MARK: AND ALAN 
EMBREE OVER 
LOOKED THEM AT 
SECOND BASE, 
TOO.
MATT: JAM SHOT, 
POPPED HIM UP, 
GREENE READ IT 
WELL OFF THE BAT
AND IS THERE TO 
FINISH THE 
INNING.
NOTHING COMES, 2
RUNNERS LEFT 
STRANDED, WE 
PLAYED 6.
TIED AT TWOO.
2 
MATT: FRIENDS, 
LOG ONTO 
PADRES.COM AND 
CASTILLA YOUR 
VOTES FOR THE 
'06 ALL-STAR 
TEAM, AND MAKE 
SURE THE PADRES 
ARE REPRESENTED 
IN PITTSBURGH.
YOU MIGHT WANT 
TO CHECK AND 
MAKE SURE THIS 
GUY ISN'T LIVING
IN YOUR ZIP CODE
WHILE YOU'RE ON 
YOUR COMPUTER.
DON'T MESS WITH 
TEXAS!
MARK BELLHORN 
LEADS THINGS OFF
IN THE SAN DIEGO
7TH.
BELLHORN, GREENE
AND CASTILLA, AS
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
CONTINUES, AND 
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
WHOSE PITCH 
COUNT AT 1 POINT
TONIGHT WAS ON 
LINE WITH THAT 
OF HIS OPPOSITE 
NUMBER HAS 
REALLY STARTED 
TO WORK QUICKLY 
NOW, SECOND AND 
THIRD TIME 
THROUGH.
HE HAD A 6-PITCH
4TH, A 5-PITCH 
5TH, AND EVEN 
WITH THE HOME 
RUN TO PIAZZA IN
THE 6TH INNING, 
HE HAD A QUICK 
6.
UP AND IN TO 
BELLHORN, 2-1.
MARK: EVEN 
THOUGH THAT WAS 
ONLY THE 77TH 
PITCH BY 
MILLWOOD, THE 
LAST COUPLE OF 
PITCHES HAVE 
BEEN UP.
I DON'T KNOW IF 
IT'S BY DESIGN, 
BUT I DOUBT IT.
A HIGH FASTBALL 
TO BELLHORN 
FOULED BACK AND 
THEN THE HIGH, 
BREAKING BALL.
STILL HAS THE 
2-SEAM RUNNING 
FASTBALL DOWN 
AND AWAY TO THE 
LEFTIES.
MATT: LAIRD SETS
UP WAY OUTSIDE, 
AND BELLHORN 
FOULS IT OFF.
TOMORROW, THE 
GAME 3 PITCHING 
MATCH-UP, AND, 
AGAIN, NO TV 
TOMORROW IN THE 
DAY GAME, 
HENSLEY FOR SAN 
DIEGO, JOHN 
RHEINECKER FOR 
THE RANGERS.
MARK: JOHN 
RHEINECKER?
MATT: FIRST-YEAR
LEFT HANDER, WHO
IS 2-1.
THE RANGERS HAVE
HAD TROUBLE WITH
THE FOUR AND 
FIVE SPOTS IN 
HIR ROTATION.
THEY JUST PUT 
KAMERON LOE ON 
THE DISABLED 
LIST YESTERDAY 
AND WE'RE TOLD 
THAT TEHADA IS 
GOING TO COME UP
FROM TRIPLE-A 
OKLAHOMA TO FILL
IN THAT SPOT 
NEXT WEEK.
2 BALLS, 2 
STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO 
BELLHORN.
FULL COUNT NOW.
MARK: I THINK 
THE PADRES AS WE
GO LATE IN THE 
BALL GAME, WE 
TALKED ABOUT 
LAIRD BEHIND 
HOME PLATE AND 
HIS SUCCESS AT 
THROWING OUT 
RUNNERS, THE 
PADRES ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO 
THIS VIA POWER 
OR TRYING TO GET
RUNNERS ACROSS.
THEY CAN THROW 
THE RUNNING GAME
OUT THE WINDOW 
UNLESS YOU PUT 
ON A HIT AND 
RUN.
MATT: JUST 
FOULED DOWN THE 
CORNER IN RIGHT.
THERE'S YOUR NET
RIGHT THERE, MUD
CAT.
MARK: THERE WAS 
ONE DOWN THE 
LEFT FIELD LINE,
ALSO.
HELLO, TEX.
MATT: THERE'S 
THE COWARD OF 
THE COUNTY 
HIMSELF, RIGHT 
THERE.
MARK: THAT'S A 
SWEET LID.
MATT: AND 
THERE'S BALL 4 
TO BELLHORN, THE
LEAD-OFF WALK 
ISSUED HERE IN 
THE 7TH.
MARK: HERE IS 
THE SITUATION I 
WAS JUST TALKING
ABOUT MATTY, 
WITH THE FIRST 
BASEMAN, 
TEIXEIRA HOLDING
ON THE RUNNER, 
BELLHORN, THERE 
IS A HUGE HOLE 
TO THE RIGHT 
SIDE.
MATT: GREENIE 
0-2 TONIGHT.
HE HAD A SINGLE 
IN YESTERDAY'S 
OPENER.
MARK: AND ALSO 
AT THIRD BASE, 
BLALOCK IS 
CREEPING IN.
I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER HE'S 
ANTICIPATING A 
BUNT OR 
WHATEVER, BUT HE
WAS UP ON THE 
GRASS A LITTLE 
BIT AGO.
MATT: OUT OF THE
STRETCH THE 
FIRST PITCH TO 
KHALIL, SLIDER, 
FOULED BACK.
THERE'S NOBODY 
UP THROWING IN 
THE RANGER 
BULLPEN YET, 
THOUGH A COUPLE 
OF GUYS ARE UP 
AND STANDING OUT
THERE AND THE 
RANGERS, LIKE 
THE PADRES, 
WORKED 
RELATIVELY DEEP 
INTO THEIR 
BULLPEN LAST 
NIGHT IN THE 
OPENER.
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
TAKING
CONSIDERABLE 
TIME BETWEEN 
PITCHES HERE 
LATE.
AND OUT OF THE 
STRETCH AGAIN, 
GREENE SWINGS 
AND SENDS A 
DRIVE WELL HIT 
OUT TO RIGHT 
CENTER FIELD, 
GARY MATTHEWS ON
THE RUN AND HE 
MAKES THE WILL 
LEE MAYS GRAB.
A FINE CATCH BY 
GARY MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR.
MARK: I THOUGHT 
THIS BALL HAD 
EXTRA BASES 
WRITTEN ALL OVER
IT.
GARY MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR HAVING A 
HECK OF A YEAR 
AT THE PLATE AND
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NICELY DONE.
HE ALMOST 
OVERRAN THAT 
BALL IT LOOKS 
LIKE, A LITTLE 
BY THE.
THAT'S A HUGE 
OUT. 
MATT: VINNY 
CASTILLA NOW 
WITH 1 GONE, 
BELLHORN REMAINS
AT FIRST.
VINNY STILL 
TRYING TO 
CONVERT ON THE 
FIVE-GAME 
HITTING STREAK 
TONIGHT, 3 FOR 4
OPENER 
YESTERDAY, 
HITLESS IN 2 
AT-BATS TONIGHT.
MARK: TELL YOU 
WHAT, KEVIN 
MILLWOOD, HE 
KNOWS EXACTLY 
THE SCOUTING 
REPORT.
FIRST PITCH 
SLIDER AWAY.
HENESS HE'S 
HACKING EARLY IN
THE COUNT.
MATT: COME 
INSIDE AND HE 
POPS IT UP.
THAT'S GOING TO 
GET INTO THE 
SEATS.
MARK: BALL IS 
COMING BACK.
MATT: NOT INTO 
THE SEATS AT 
ALL.
IT'S COMING BACK
INDEED.
WOW!
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MATT: NEVER GIVE
UP ON A POP OVER
TO THAT THIRD 
BASE SIDE OFF 
THE RIGHT 
HANDER'S SIDE, 
AS HANK BLALOCK 
PROVES ME WRONG.
MARK: BOCH 
ALMOST HAD TO 
GET OUT OF THE 
WAY, JIM 
MALONEY.
THAT BALL TUCK 
18, 20 DIFFERENT
TURNS IN THE 
AIR.
HANK BLALOCK 
SQUEEZES IT FOR 
THE OUT. 
MATT: 2 GONE 
NOW.
UP TO BARFIELD 
TO TRY TO 
FURTHER THAT 
LEAD-OFF WALK.
JOSH HAS ONE OF 
SAN DIEGO'S 6 
HITS TONIGHT ON 
THE FIRST PITCH 
HE POPS INTO 
FOUL TERRITORY.
TEIXEIRA MAKING 
THE CATCH.
MILLWOOD 
TIGHTENS UP 
AFTER THE 
LEAD-OFF WALK.
7TH INNING 
STRETCH IN 
ARLINGTON.
TIED AT 2.
MATT: COME OUT 
TO THE BALLPARK 
ON SATURDAY FOR 
GAME 2 OF THE 
WEEK END SERIES 
WITH THE 
MARINERS AND GET
THERE EARLY FOR 
FIESTA, CON LOS 
PADRES.
MARK: CALL 
877-FRIAR-TIX, 
OR PADRES.COM.
MATT: JOHN 
ADKINS GETS THE 
CALL AND IS ON 
THE MOUND NOW.
MARK: POSSIBLY 
FOR ADKINS, 
SOMEBODY OUT OF 
THE BULLPEN, 
HOPEFULLY, AND 
THE BOTTOM OF 
THE ORDER FOR 
JOHN.
MATT: IAN 
KINSLER LEADS 
THINGS OFF FOR 
TEXAS.
IT WILL BE 
KINSLER, LAIRD 
AND MATTHEWS, 
FOR THE RANGERS.
2 RUNS ON 6 
HITS, 2 ERRORS 
COMMITTED BY SAN
DIEGO TONIGHT, 
AND 2 RUNS, 4 
HITS, NO ERRORS 
BY THE RANGERS.
THIS IS WHAT WE 
EXPECTED COMING 
OUT TO THE 
BALLPARK 
TONIGHT.
WITH MILLWOOD 
VERSUS YOUNG, 
YOU DIDN'T LOOK 
FOR THIS TO BE 
THE OFFENSIVE 
NIGHT THAT BOTH 
TEAMS ENJOYED 
LAST NIGHT.
MARK: SO IT 
SEEMS LIKE THE 
MISSQUES ARE 
GOING TO BE THE 
STORY TONIGHT, 
HUH?
THANK GOODNESS 
THE ERROR IN THE
6TH BY VINNY 
CASTILLA DIDN'T 
SCORE ANY RUNS, 
LEFT TWO RUNNERS
STRANDED.
MATT: IS THAT 
JOE CAMEL?
I DON'T THINK 
THAT'S FAMILY 
FRIENDLY TO HAVE
A CIGARETTE 
MASCOT HERE.
MARK: I'M 
TALKING TO YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
SEE YOU, BIG 
BOY.
LOOK AT THE 
MULLET ON THAT 
GUY. 
MATT: I THINK 
THE "T" IS FOR 
TIRED.
GROUNDED OUT TO 
SHORTSTOP, 
KHALIL MAKES THE
PLAY.
DOESN'T THAT 
LOOK LIKE JOE 
CAMEL?
MARK: IT DOES 
LOOK LIKE HIM?
MATT: IAN 
KINSLER RETIRED 
FOR THE FIRST 
OUT OF THE 
INNING.
[CHUCKLES] 
MARK: YOU KNOW, 
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO 
GIVE TOM 
CETERSKI A POINT
IN THE TRUCK, IT
LOOKS LIKE 
FABIO.
MATT: GERALD 
LAIRD THE BATTER
NOW, AND HE 
GROUNDS TO 
GREENE.
GREENIE HAS NOT 
TAKEN ANY OF HIS
OFFENSIVE WOES 
TO THE FIELD 
WITH HIM THIS 
MONTH, THOUGH 
IT'S BEEN A HOT 
AND COLD MONTH 
AT THE PLATE, 
HE'S BEEN 
OUTSTANDING 
DEFENSE SIL.
MARK: HE KNOWS 
THAT HIS GLOVE 
IS VALUABLE, 
ESPECIALLY AT 
THE SHORTSTOP 
POSITION, 
THERE'S NO DOUBT
ABOUT THAT.
HE'S PROVEN IT 
SINCE HIS FIRST 
DAY IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES.
THAT'S A SERIOUS
TALENT RIGHT 
THERE.
MATT: THEY COULD
PUT HIM ON THAT 
NEW SHOW WITH 
REGIS.
GARY MATTHEWS, 
JUNIOR WITH 2 
GONE AND HE 
PICKS ON THE 
FIRST PITCH AND 
BOUNCES IT INTO 
RIGHT FOR HIS 
FIRST HIT OF THE
SERIES.
SO THE 2-OUT 
SINGLE AGAINST 
ADKINS AND NOW 
JOHN WILL GO TO 
WORK AGAINST 
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
WHO IS 1-3 
TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, WE 
TALKED ABOUT THE
DISCREPANCY IN 
THESE TEAMS' 
RECORDS IN 1-RUN
DECISIONS LAST 
NIGHT.
THE RANGERS HAVE
NOT FAIRED WELL 
IN ONE-RUN BALL 
GAMES, LOSING 
ONE YESTERDAY, 
AND YOU START TO
THINK ABOUT THAT
KIND OF NUMBER 
LATE IN A TIE 
GAME.
RANGERS ARE 8-13
IN ONE-RUN 
AFFAIRS THIS 
YEAR.
THEY'VE PLAYED 
IN A LOT OF 
CLOSE ONCE, TOO.
ONLY THE OAKLAND
A.'S HAVE PLAYED
IN MORE GAMES 
DECIDED BY 2 OR 
FEWER RUNS AMONG
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
CLUBS.
SPEAKING OF 
OAKLAND, THEY'RE
IN ACTION IN 
DENVER.
A.'S AND ROCKIES
TIED IN THE 4TH,
AND THE ANGLES 
DEFEATED 
SAN FRANCISCO, 
TODAY, AND THE 
DODGERS AND 
MARINERS ARE 
JUST GETTING 
UNDERWAY NOW.
THE WHITE SOX 
PUTTING THE HURT
ON ST. LOUIS 
AGAIN TONIGHT.
MARK: THEY HAD A
BIG NIGHT LAST 
NIGHT.
MATT: 12-4 IN 
THE 7TH INNING 
AT U.S. 
CELLULAR.
MARK: HAWK IS 
HAVING A HEY 
DAY, HUH?
MATT: I GOTTA 
BELIEVE THAT 
CARDINAL BULLPEN
IS PRETTY BEAT 
UP.
MARK: I THINK 
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
TRIED TO PULL A 
FAST ONE, HE 
CAUGHT THAT BALL
AND ACTED LIKE 
THE BALL GOT BY 
HIM.
LET'S SEE THE 
ACTING JOB 
ADRIAN DOES.
SEE THAT?
MATT: GARY SAYS,
NIE TRY.
BIG SWING AND A 
MISS TO RETIRE 
THE SIDE.
ADKINS STRIKES 
OUT YOUNG, 
NOTHING IN THE 
RANGER 7TH, ON 
TO THE 8TH, 
STILL TIED 2 
APIECE.
MATT: TUNE IN 
FOR FORFRONT AND
MEET A MAN WHO 
FOR MORE THAN 3 
DECADES 
ANNOUNCED PADRES
GAMES AND HAS 
WRITTEN ABOUT 
HIS EXPERIENCES,
YOU SEE HIM ON 
THE LEFT, BOB 
CHANDLER, LONG 
TIME SAN DIEGO 
VOICE, ON 
FORFRONT 
TOMORROW NIGHT 
AT 4:30 AND 
8:30, LOG ONTO 
4SD.COM FOR MORE
INFORMATION.
E.Y. LEADS OFF 
TONIGHT.
AND HE HAD GOOD 
NUMBERS AGAINST 
MILLWOOD AND 
THAT WAS PART OF
THE DECISION 
THAT BRUCE BOCHY
MADE WHEN HE 
DECIDED TO START
YOUNG OVER BEN 
JOHNSON.
E.Y. TRYING TO 
VALIDATE THAT 
START TONIGHT.
MARK: HE COULD 
HAVE HAD A HIT 
EARLIER IN THE 
THIRD INNING, 
BUT MICHAEL 
YOUNG MADE A 
HECK OF A PLAY, 
TAKING A HIT 
AWAY FROM E.Y.
MATT: 1 BALL, 1 
STRIKE TO HERR TO HER 
RICK YOUNG.
MICHAEL YOUNG 
HAS TAKEN AWAY 
ALL 3 OF ERIC 
YOUNG'S PLATE 
APPEARANCES 
TONIGHT.
MILLWOOD ROCKS 
AND FIRES THE 
1-1, TURNS OVER 
A SLIDER, 2 
BALLS AND A 
STRIKE.
CHECK THAT, 2-2 
TO YOUNG.
AND, AGAIN, IT'S
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
FRUSTRATING E.Y.
TONIGHT.
SO ERIC YOUNG 
0-4 AGAINST 
MILLWOOD.
AND NOW MIKE 
CAMERON WHO HAS 
HAD A GOOD 
NIGHT, SINGLED, 
AND SCORED A 
RUN.
GILES NEXT AND 
THEN PIAZZA, AND
THIS MAY BE THE 
LAST OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE 
RUN-PRODUCING 
PART OF THE LINE
UP, YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO THINK 
THEY CAN GET 
SOMEBODY GOING 
WITH AT LEAST A 
BASE RUNNER TO 
PUT MILLWOOD OUT
OF THE STRETCH.
1-0 TO MIKE 
CAMERON.
THERE'S SOME 
TELLING NUMBERS 
FROM THE 8TH 
INNING ON IT HAS
NOT BEEN GOOD 
TIMES FOR KEVIN 
MILLWOOD.
THERE'S NOBODY 
UP BEHIND HIM 
RIGHT NOW.
INCH I WAS GOING
TO SAY, IN THE 
EVENT MAYBE OF 
AN EXTRA-BASE 
HIT OR 
SOMETHING, I 
KNOW BUCK 
SHOWALTER HAS A 
QUICK HOOK, 
ALTHOUGH 
MILLWOOD HAS 
BEEN AROUND A 
LONG, LONG TIME,
HE CAN FIGURE 
OUT WHICH WAY 
MILLWOOD IS 
GOING TO GO, BUT
I'M SURPRISED 
NOBODY IS UP IN 
THAT BULLPEN, 
EVEN THOUGH HE'S
ONLY THROWN 95 
PITCHES.
GOOD RATIO FOR 
KEVIN MILLWOOD, 
2-1.
MATT: CAMERON 
OFF THE END OF 
THE BAT, FRIEZ 
INTO SHORT RIGHT
CENTER FIELD, 
GARY MATTHEWS 
FOR OUT NO. 2.
OUTSIDE OF THE 
PIAZZA HOME RUN 
THERE HASN'T 
BEEN A LOT OF 
POP TONIGHT.
MIKE'S HOME RUN 
AND GILES R.B.I.
DOUBLE THE ONLY 
TWO EXTRA BASE 
HITS FOR SAN 
DIEGO, AND, 
AGAIN, NOT SO 
MUCH A CRITICISM
TO THE PADRES AS
IT IS TO KEVIN 
MILLWOOD AND 
WHAT HE'S DONE 
TONIGHT.
MARK: MILLWOOD 
HAS HAD GOOD 
DEFENSE BEHIND 
HIM.
WE'VE MENTIONED 
PLAYS THE 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
MADE, THE KHALIL
GREENE CENTER 
FIELD HIT BY 
GARY MATTHEWS, 
AND MILLWOOD HAS
HAD TWO DOUBLE 
PLAYS TONIGHT 
THAT HELPED HIS 
CAUSE, 
GROUNDERS, ON 
THE INFIELD, 
TOO.
MATT: A BALL AND
A STRIKE TO 
GILES.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF
THE WEAK SPOTS, 
IT'S BEEN AN
IT'S BEEN 
ACHILLES HEAL 
FOR THE RANGERS,
IS THE BULLPEN.
BUT WHEN THE 
STARTER STAYS 
OUT THERE F 8 
INNINGS, YOU 
DON'T HAVE A 
CHANCE TO GET 
INTO THAT.
HERE IS THE 1-2.
MARK: HE HAD A 
PITCH THERE, 
MATTY.
LOOKED LIKE HE 
WAS UP, MIDDLE 
OF THE PLATE AND
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
MAY BE RUBBING 
UP THAT NEW ROCK
OUT THERE 
THINKING, YOU 
KNOW, WHAT?
I JUST GOT AWAY 
WITH ONE.
MATT: A CROWD OF
NEARLY 30,000 
STRONG MAKING 
THEIR NOISE IN 
SUPPORT OF THEIR
STARTER, 2-2.
SO GILES FROM 
BEHIND IN THE 
DOWNTOWN A FULL 
COUNT NOW, 3-2, 
TRYING TO KEEP 
IT ALIVE FOR 
PIAZZA WHO HAS 
HOMERED TONIGHT.
MIKE WEIGHTS 
NEXT.
3-2 HOME.
BALL 4.
AND BY THE 
NARROWEST OF 
MARGINS, 
MILLWOOD HAS 
WALKED HIS 
SECOND HITTER OF
THE NIGHT.
SO NOW THE MAN 
RESPONSE I WILL 
FOR TONIGHT'S 
COORS LITE COLD,
HARD BLAST, MIKE
PIAZZA WHO 
STEPPED UP TO 
THE PLATE IN THE
6TH WITH 2 GONE.
THIS TIED IT. 
MIKE'S 9TH OF 
THE YEAR.
MARK: MATTY, 
WITH THAT WALK 
HE GOT A BEEHIVE
WORKING IN THAT 
TEXAS RANGERS 
BULLPEN.
THEY GOT UP IN A
HURRY.
RON MAHAY, THE 
LEFT HANDER, WE 
SAW HIM LAST 
NIGHT.
AND THE PITCHING
COACH BUYING 
TIME FOR THETHE 
LEFTY SO HE CAN 
GET LOOSE.
MATT: MIKE 41 ON
THE LIST OF MOST
CAREER HOME 
RUNS, AND IF HE 
KEEPS IT GOING 
IN 2007, HE WILL
SETTLE SOMEWHERE
IN THE HIGH 30'S
ON THE ALL-TIME 
HOME RUN LIST 
THIS YEAR.
ONE OF MIKE'S 9 
HAS COME TO WIN 
A BALL GAME.
REMEMBER THE 
DRAMATIC 9TH 
INNING HOME RUN 
AT WRIGLEY FIELD
IN APRIL?
PIAZZA TAKES A 
STRIKE HERE.
GOOD BREAKING 
BALL TO CATCH 
THE CORNER TO 
PUT MIKE IN THE 
HOLE, 0-2.
MARK: THAT WAS A
DANDY.
GREAT, PINPOINT 
CONTROL ON THE 
LAST 2 BREAKING 
BALLS.
STAY OUT OF THE 
HOT ZONE OF 
PIAZZA.
THAT'S A PERFECT
PITCH.
MAN!
YOU KNOW, FOR 
THROWING 104 
PITCHES, THAT 
BEING THE 105TH,
THAT'S PRETTY 
DARN GOOD.
MATT: FASTBALL 
THAT WAS TOO FAR
INSIDE FOR 
MILLWOOD TO GET 
HURT ON.
MARK: YEP.
MATT: GOOD 0-2 
PITCH.
36 TIMES IN MIKE
PIAZZA'S CAREER 
HE HAS COME UP 
WITH A MULTIPLE 
HOME RUN GAME.
MOST RECENTLY, 
LAST 
SEPTEMBER AS A 
MET IN 
WASHINGTON.
SPEAKING OF THE 
METS, THEY BLEW 
A LEAD AT HOME 
TONIGHT.
BILLY WAGNER 
BLEW A SAVE AS 
CINCINNATI CAME 
FROM BEHIND TO 
BEAT THEM.
THERE GOES GILES
AND THE THROW 
DOWN TO SECOND 
IS NOT IN TIME!
THE SNAEK ATTACK
STOLEN BASE BY 
GILES, HIS 5TH 
OF THE YEAR, 
HE'S IN SCORING 
POSITION NOW ON 
1-2 TO PIAZZA.
MARK: WE 
MENTIONED THAT 
LAIRD BEHIND 
HOME PLATE HAS 
THROWN OUT 60%, 
JUST IN TIME HE 
GETS UNDER THE 
TAG.
MATT: SLIDER 
MISSES OUTSIDE 
TO MAKE IT 2-2 
NOW, PIAZZA 
DOING A GOOD JOB
OF RECOGNIZING 
AND LAYING OFF.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
NEXT.
2-2 IS HIT ON 
THE FWROUND TO 
SHORTSTOP, YOUNG
IS THERE.
TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE 8TH, TIED, 2
APIECE.
MATT: SUNDAY AT 
PETCO PARK IS 
KIDS DAY, 14 AND
YOUNGER RECEIVE 
A GIVE AWAY ITEM
OF THE DECADE, 
MUD CAT.
MARK: WHAT'S 
THAT?
MATT: THE PADRES
MR. POTATO HEAD 
PADRE.
LOOK THAT.
THE ARM, THE 
EYES, THINK OF 
THE FUN.
MARK: THAT'S 
NICE.
MATT: TICKETS 
ARE AVAILABLE AT
PADRES.COM OR 
877-FRIAR-TIX.
THAT IS A VALID 
MR. POTATO HEAD,
TOO, NOT A 
KNOCK-OFF.
SCOTT GETS A 
FIRST PITCH OUT 
TONIGHT, AND HE 
MAKES HIS 33 HIS 33RD 
INNING.
YEAR.
A NEW CATCHER, 
HE IS WORKING, 
TOO, AS BOWEN 
HAS TAKEN OVER 
HIEN THE PLATE.
MATT: HERE IS 
HANK BLALOCK, 
NOW.
1 AWAY, BASES 
EMPTY, 2-2 TIE, 
LAST OF THE 8TH.
GOOD ONE 
TONIGHT.
HANK BLALOCK 
SENDS A DRIVE 
INTO CENTER, 
THIS WILL STAY 
PLAYABLE FOR 
MIKE CAMERON.
2 QUICK OUTS FOR
SCOTT LINEBRINK 
WHO IS PART OF 
WHAT IS 
STATISTICALLY 
THE BEST PULL 
BEEN IN MAJOR 
LEAGUE BASEBALL 
IN TERMS OF 
E.R.A., 3.23, 
THE LOWEST IN 
THE GAME.
MARK: CAN YOU 
SAY ROLAIDS 
RELIEF BULLPEN 
AWARD?
STARTERS LOVE 
THAT BUT IT'S A 
GREAT FEELING 
WHEN YOU LEAVE A
BALL GAME AND 
YOU HAVE 6, 7 
SOLID INNINGS 
AND YOU HAVE 
GUYS LIKE 
ADKINS, CASSIDY,
LINEBRINK COMING
IN.
HOPEFULLY THEY 
CAN BRIDGE THAT 
GAP TO TREVOR 
HOFFMAN, AS A 
FORMER FRIAR 
STARTS TO HEAT 
UP FOR THE 
RANGERS, AKINORI
OTSUKA.
MATT: AKI, OUR 
GUY.
MARK DeROSA 
STOLE A BASE 
TONIGHT, SECOND 
OF THE YEAR, AND
YOU TALKED ABOUT
IT YESTERDAY 
THAT WHAT AKI 
COMES IN IN A 
SAVE SITUATION 
IN ARLINGTON, 
THEY PLAY "HELLS
BELLS" OVER THE 
STADIUM INTERCOM
SYSTEM, AND AKI 
ABOUT A 
RESPECTFUL GUY 
THAT YOU WOULD 
EVER WANT TO 
MEET, AND BEFORE
THEY DID THAT, 
HE ASKED TREVOR 
IF IT WAS OKAY.
MARK: THAT'S 
AKI.
MATT: BASE HIT 
BACK UP THE 
HILGDZ.
MIDDLE.
MATT: 2-OUT 
SINGLE, SO MARK 
DeROSA IS ABOARD
AND NOW MENCH.
MARK: BOTH 
PITCHING STAFFS 
THIS EVENING, 
KEVIN MILLWOOD 
HAS GONE THE 
WHOLE WAY SO 
FAR, BUT 6 HITS 
SURRENDERED BY 
BOTH CLUBS, AND 
MARK DeROSA IS 
THE ONLY GUY IN 
THE LINE UP THAT
HAS 2 HITS.
MATT: HERE IS 
MENCH, NOW.
AGAIN, THE 5 AND
6 HOLES HAVE 
BEEN THE PROBLEM
SPOTS TONIGHT.
MENCH HAS A HIT 
AND AN R.B.I. 
HERE IS A 
QUESTION FOR YOU
MUD CAT.
MARK: OKAY.
MATT: WHAT DOES 
KEVIN MENCH HAVE
IN COMMON WITH 
OUR GOOD FRIEND 
GORDON SHAW FROM
THE CLEANERS?
MARK: UM 
MATT: I'LL GIVE 
YOU A HINT, IT'S
NOT HAT SIZE.
KEVIN MENCH 
WEARS AN 8.
THAT HAS EARNED 
HIM THE NICKNAME
SHREK.
THEY'RE BOTH 
DELAWARE GUYS. 
MARK: OH, YEAH, 
YEAH, YEAH. 
THAT'S RIGHT.
MATT: OUR GUY, 
GORDON?
MARK: THAT'S 
RIGHT.
NOT TOO MANY 
GUYS IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES FROM 
DELAWARE.
MATT: IT'S A 
PRETTY SHORT 
LIST.
I MEAN, ACTIVE 
BIG LEAGUERS, 
YOU KNOW, YOU 
GOT MENCH, 
DESHIELDS, LONG 
SINCE RETIRED.
MARK: WHAT'S 
THEIR CKNAME?
MATT: SMALL 
STATE YOUR FULL 
NAME AND SPELL 
IT FOR THE 
RECORD 
MARK: THE 
FIGHTING 
PEACOCKS?
MATT: AND WHEN 
THOSE CLOTHES 
GET DIRTY, LOOK 
OUT...
THIS IS A BIG 
DOME.
WHAT SIZE DO YOU
WEAR?
MARK: 7 3/4.
MATT: WHAT DOES 
BOCH WEAR?
MARK: 8 PLUS.
MATT: AND THAT'S
WHAT MENCH 
WEARS.
BRAD WILKERSON 
ON DECK AS 
LINEBRINK IS 
CAREFUL NOT TO 
IGNORE MARK 
DeROSA AT FIRST.
A 2-2 TIE AND 
THIS IS WHERE 
EAVE BEEN SINCE 
THE PIAZZA HOME 
RUN IN THE TOP 
OF THE 6TH.
MARK: DID YOU 
MENTION THE 
STOLEN BASES 
MARK DeROSA HAS 
THIS YEAR?
MATT: I DID.
MENTION IT AGAIN
FOR THE PEOPLE.
MARK: IT'S ONLY 
ONE, FOLKS, BUT 
SOMETHING COULD 
BE ON, HERE.
2, I TAKE THAT 
BACK, 1 TONIGHT.
MATT: IT'S 3-1 
ON MENCH, NOW.
BRAD WILKERSON 
IS DUE UP AND 
HE'LL BE 
LINEBRINK'S 
HITTER.
EMBREE HAS BEEN 
USED FOR ONE 
HITTER TONIGHT.
MARK: THE PACE 
OF THIS GAME HAS
SLOWED DOWN, 
HUH?
MATT: YEAH, IT 
HAS.
AND THAT WILL 
FILL THE COUNT, 
3-2.
ALWAYS THOUGHT 
KEVIN MENCH WITH
HAIR WOULD LIKE 
LIKE KEVIN 
MILAR.
RUNNER GOES ON 
3-2 AND MENCH 
FOULS IT AWAY.
HE'S ANOTHER 
RANGER HITTER 
THAT DOES NOT 
GET CHEATED.
FORGET ABOUT 
SHORTENING UP 
THE 3-2 PITCH.
[CHUCKLES] 
MARK: MENCH 
LOOKS LIKE 
DYNAMO FROM 
RUNNING MAN.
MATT: THAT'S A 
GOOD CALL.
OBSCURE BUT 
GOOD.
RUNNER GOES 
AGAIN A SWING 
AND A MISS, AND 
LINEBRINK SETS 
THE RANGERS DOWN
WITHOUT, IN THE 
8TH.
ON TO THE 9TH.
TIED TWO APIECE.

MATT: visit 
PADRES.COM, for 
the official 
baseball news, 
Padres on a 
mission.
.
unusual because 
when Trevor 
sanctioned 
"Hells Bells" 
for Aki, I guess
he didn't think 
he would be 
entering to 
that.
MARK: I was 
surprised at 
that, also.
MATT: as fans 
know, Aki did 
not begin the 
season as the 
closer.
after shuffling 
people around, 
they've settled 
in on Akinori 
Otsuka at the 
back of the 
bullpen. it's 
again a good 
decision.
as Mud 
mentioned, he's 
converted in 13 
of his 15 
opportunities 
this year.
Gonzalez gets to
it with a 
lead-off in the 
9th.
there's your 
potential 
go-ahead run to 
lead off inning 
No. 9.
going to have a 
pinch-runner as 
Adrian is lifted
for Ben Johnson.
with a D.H. in 
play, there are 
a lot of things 
that can happen.
there aren't 
constraints as 
far as where 
guys can play.
MARK: right, and
the guys 
remaining on the
bench now for 
San Diego, you 
can scratch 
Bowen off, but 
Blum and Bard, 
Bard had that 
foul tip off his
left foot last 
night.
MATT: nothing-1 
the count to 
Bellhorn, who 
has singled and 
walked.
MARK: you make a
good point, 
Matty, regarding
the American 
league.
every one talked
E.Y. about 
playing in the 
American league.
he said 
collecting a lot
of rust, not a 
lot of A.B. 
aechlts 
MATT: you don't 
find guys 
anxious to go to
American league 
teams as 
F-troopers.
you're not going
to get a lot of 
at-bats, 
comparatively 
speaking, that 
is.
ask Geoff Blum 
about that.
MARK: Blummer 
told us this 
spring, the 
world series, 
before the 
dramatic home 
run he said, you
know what?
I've seen one 
fastball in 
three weeks.
MATT: that was 
his -- it was 
game three of 
the world 
series, extra 
innings, the 
pinch-hit home 
run.
game 4, rather.
no, it was game 
3.
at any rate, 
pretty sure it 
was game 3.
what did Blumme 
tell us?
that was his 
first at-bat in,
what -- 
MARK: 3 weeks.
MATT: was it 3 
weeks?
MARK: yeah.
MATT: 2 balls 
and 1 strike the
count to Mark 
Bellhorn.
dare I say there
is no line up in
baseball more 
familiar with 
Aki than that of
the San Diego 
Padres.
a whole 
different 
experience with 
people behind 
him, however, 
and Bellhorn 
swings ask sends
a high drive to 
right.
Mark DeRosa has 
the play off the
bat and it 
looked like that
was going to get
out farther, 1 
gone.
MATT: have you 
ever purchased a
car from Mossy 
Nissan, the way 
to buy includes 
upfront 
information, use
of the IQ 
computers, 
compares the 
price of a 
vehicle at Mossy
to vehicle 
prices at other 
dealer ships, 
six locations in
San Diego 
county, National
City, say high 
to Tim Howell, 
Mossy Nissan.
here is
Khalil Greene 
with 1 out shs 1
on.
Castilla next, 
should it go 
farther.
anything short 
of a double play
ball and Vinny 
will have an 
at-bat, here.
you know, Aki 
kept his house 
in San Diego.
it was with a 
rather heavy 
heart that he 
was dealt to the
Rangers in the 
off-season.
he still loves 
it in San Diego.
in fact, he and 
his family make 
that their 
year-round home 
still.
kids are out of 
school, we 
understand, and 
heading to 
Arlington this 
week.
MARK: uh-huh.
it was recently 
that Aki blue a 
save and he got 
on the horn and 
talked to Trevor
and he said, 
help me try to 
deal with this.
he said the 
thing is to keep
up your 
confidence and 
turn the page 
MATT: Greene 
lines to left 
center, Johnson 
to second, and 
daying has 
something 
brewing here 
late against an 
old teammate.
MARK: we've seen
the opposition 
pitching against
Khalil Greene 
lately.
he's having with
the breaking 
ball down and 
away.
in the short 
time Merv 
Rettenmund has 
been here, he's 
been working 
with Khalil 
Greene.
he didn't hang 
that, it was a 
good pitch, he 
stayed on it 
nicely and hit 
it to left 
center.
MATT: the second
time tonight 
that San Diego 
has put together
more than one 
hit in an 
inning.
now it's up to 
Vinny, looking 
to convert on 
the 5-game 
hitting streak 
tonight.
0-3 thus far.
that one bounces
away from Laird,
throw gets away 
from Hank 
Blalock.
here comes 
Johnson and San 
Diego takes a 
leave-2 lead.
Greene to third.
did that remind 
you of Friday at
Anaheim?
MARK: good call.
MATT: wow!
same point of 
the night, top 
of the 9th.
Mike tried to 
get a runner in 
Anaheim, and -- 
boy.
this time it was
Laird who tried 
to make an 
all-star caliber
play, that was 
going to be 
awfully close at
third.
MARK: it looked 
like a catchable
ball for Blalock
at third, also.
MATT: so the 
infield in now 
forecast, swing 
and a miss, as 
he goes behind, 
or rather one 
ball, one strike
to Vinny, now.
irony of 
ironies, a run 
scores against 
Aki and now 
Trevor is up for
the bottom of 
the 9th.
MARK: well, we 
heard bells.
doesn't 
necessarily mean
that he has to 
follow those 
bells, right?
MATT: 1-2 to 
Castilla.
swing and a 
miss.
that's one of 
the four or five
Ak sliders 
that's in the 
toolbox.
so 2 Fwaun and 
now Josh 
Barfield, a 
costly throwing 
error hung on 
Gerald Laird 
here as he tried
to get the pinch
runner at third 
that bounce ad 
way from him.
MARK: it would 
be nice to get a
little Esurance,
here, how about 
a 2-out knock?
MATT: Josh takes
a strike.
you know, it's 
one thing when 
the angles, lose
a game, with a 
play like the 
one that 
happened on 
Friday.
it's another 
thing when it 
happens here.
the Rangers are 
a much better 
defensive team.
Aki has Josh 
Barfield 0-2.
slider fouled 
away.
MARK: the last 
game that we 
played in 
Anaheim, the 
angles had 56 
errors.
now the Rangers 
are 42, compared
to the 56 Angel 
errors.
MATT: an 
unrender run, 
Trevor time for 
the second 
straight night.
MATT: for the 
second straight 
night in the 
series, Trevor 
time on the 
road.
tonight Trevor 
looks for save 
No. 18, and, 
again, it's a 
1-run lead that 
he's called onto
protect here in 
Arlington.
MARK: last night
in the 9th it 
was 1, 2, 3 due 
up for the 
Rangers, tonight
the bottom 
third.
it is going to 
be Brad 
Wilkerson, Ian 
Kinsler and 
Gerald Laird, 
due up for the 
Rangers.
MATT: this is 
how the Padres 
reOrient 
defensively.
it will be Blum 
taking over for 
Gonzalez at 
first and the 
man that ran, 
Ben Johnson, 
takes over for 
Young in left.
here we go.
as Mud 
mentioned, 
bottom third of 
the order for 
Texas.
can Trevor 
continue to -- 
continue to make
a 1-run decision
a difficult 
thing for Buck 
Showalter to 
pallet?
here is 
Wilkerson, a 
swing and a miss
at a fastball, 
0-1.
Trevor making 
his 4th career 
appearance here 
in this yard.
MARK: even 
though that was 
first pitch 
swinging, he 
looked like he 
didn't know what
to expect from 
Trevor.
there really 
wasn't the good,
full, 
first-pitch rip.
MATT: just 
missing the 
corners, here, 
2-1.
Brad Wilkerson
has more
experience 
against Trevor 
Hoffman than 
anybody on this 
Rangers roster 
by virtue of his
days in the 
national league,
0-5 with 3 
strikeouts.
3-1 now.
Ian Kinsler next
and then Laird.
fastball right 
Doin the middle 
taken to fill 
the count, 3-2.
MARK: that's 
that pitch 
Trevor can throw
8 out of 10 
times behind in 
the count, when 
needed.
it's that 
4-seamer, hit 
the glove, you 
bet.
MATT: full 
count.
Bowen wants is 
on the corner 
and he stays 
alive.
Oakland and 
Colorado tied 1 
apiece, the 
giants have 
lost, the 
damagerdamage 
dodgers have a 
1-nothing lead 
on the Mariners 
in the third.
and they can 
pick up a full 
game in the 
division tonight
if they can pull
this one out.
MARK: how did 
that miss?
that pitch is 
not low.
MATT: Bill 
Welkie was the 
first base 
umpire last 
night and called
the ball foul 
off the bat of 
Mark Teixeira 
last night.
Ian Kinsler is 
0-3 tonight, 
reached on an 
error and scored
in the 5th.
MARK: almost 100
at-bats for Ian 
Kinsler, he has 
yet to ground 
into a double 
play.
MATT: I like 
where you were 
going with that,
put the Whammie 
on him.
MARK: believe 
it. 
MATT: ball and 
no strikes.
MARK: once 
against, Ian 
Kinsler has yet 
to ground into a
double play this
year.
MATT: got a 
pinch-runner at 
first base, 
Freddy Guzman, 
the former 
Padre, called up
from triple-A 
Oklahoma City 
yesterday to 
replace Kameron 
Loe on the 
roster.
if you missed 
his Padre career
you picked up 
change between 
the sofa 
cushions, though
at one point 
considered a top
perfect.
Greene to 
Barfield, back 
to Blum, what 
was that you 
said earlier?
MARK: he has yet
to ground into a
double play 
until now in the
ninth.
MATT: believe 
it.
2 gone in the 
9th.
MARK: see 
Greenie get rid 
of that hot 
potato?
that's mashed 
garlic right 
there.
MATT: not a bad 
pick by Blummer,
either?
MARK: no.
MATT: that puts 
$100 into the 
coffers by Jack 
in the Box for 
big brothers and
big SistersSisters.
1-1 the count.
the Trevor 
Hoffman family 
can make their 
plans for 
Pittsburgh.
MARK: good call.
I think even the
men of the 
square table 
would agree with
that.
MATT: popped him
up and this 
should do it.
almost 30,000 
with a 
collective Moan,
the type heard 
out of the 
Americas arena 
last night when 
the ma Mavs choked.
how about the 
Padre bullpen, 
combining for 3 
and a third of 
scoreless 
relief, 
finished, as 
always by Trevor
Hoffman, this 
program and this
award approved 
by the men of 
the square 
table, good 
call.
Friars 4-1 on 
the road trip.
win for a 
consecutive 
night tonight.
beer back.
MARK: time for the plays of the 
game, Matty, and they're brought
to you by Murray Lampert 
instruction.
making your remodel seamless.
that's the goal.
100% satisfaction since 1975.
what do you have for me?
MATT: Giles starting the offense
tonight and San Diego had a 
1-nothing lead as Mike Cameron 
came around.
that would hold until the bottom
of the 4th when Mench singled to
score Mark DeRosa, at 1-1 tie 
took us to the top of the 5th, 
or the last of the 5th, rather, 
when Gary Matthews, Junior, 
delivered a sacrifice fly that 
gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
the Padres tied it on a Piazza 
blast in the 6th, and they would
win it with a run in the 9th.
Aki's slider was too much for 
Laird to handle and as he tried 
to cut down Ben Johnson he threw
the ball away, and Johnson 
scored what would be the winning
run and San Diego has taken 
their second straight 1-run 
decision in Arlington, 3-2 
Friars the final score.
we're back after this. 
MATT: final game summary brought
to you by the staying county 
Ford dealers.
see them today. the Padres have
won threeing in a row, it's a 
4-1 trip through the A.L. west.
tonight's victory is for 
Linebrink, with a save by 
Trevor.
Piazza hit No. 406, not to be 
lost was Chris Young's effort, 7
strikeouts pitching into the 6th
inning and, Mud cat, there is 
plenty of sunshining on this 
dog's rear end right now.
MARK: this game boiled down to a
missque, and Kevin Millwood 
tried to keep the Rangers in 
this ball game and it was a bad 
throw to third base that was the
difference.
MATT: Friars willing to bed 
38-33 with at least a 1-game 
least in the national league 
west pending what happens with 
the dodgers, and Mariners 
tonight.
we'll next join you on Friday.
"Outta Left Field" starts at 6 
and game "Prime Time Padres" 
6:30.
and then we'll start the game.
MARK: don't mess with the 
Friars.
MATT: final score, San Diego 
wins, 3-2 Padres.

Would it be okay if I sat here?
Is she serious?
Whatever!
New girl!
Words can't bring me down.

quickest amount of time
possible.
The music's incredible.
The moves are easy.
And they get you the results you

>> Boom boom boom 
To the open room 
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
was created by world-renowned
fitness expert:
As a wife and working mother of
two, Chalene developed Turbo Jam
as a fitness solution that fit
into her own busy lifestyle.
Since then, Chalene has appeared
in more than 50 fitness videos.
She's become an international
fitness celebrity, a
sought-after health and fitness
writer, and:
>> male announcer: Now Chalene
has taken her red-hot health
club workout to an even higher

ever.
In fact, it's proven to:
And it's so effective, you're
guaranteed to lose up to 10
pounds and 10 inches in your

back.
>> In 10 days, I've lost over
10 pounds and over 10 inches.
And overall, Turbo Jam's helped
me lose over 70 pounds and five
dress sizes.
>> female announcer: No matter
what your age or fitness level--
>> Turbo Jam is for everyone.
>> It doesn't matter what age
you are whether you are 12 or
60.
>> I love the music.
It's funky.

pounds, Turbo Jam is the answer.
>> Lost 15 pounds.
When from a size 10 to a size 6

>> With Turbo Jam, I've lost 101

Anyone can follow along and get

In fact, you're guaranteed to
lose up to 10 pounds and 10
inches in your first 10 days.
But more importantly, this is a
program you'll want to keep
doing so you can shed all those
unwanted pounds and inches and
totally reshape your body.
>> Thanks to Turbo Jam, I have
lost 25 pounds, 10 1/2 inches
all over my body.
I went from a size 10.
Now I'm back into a size 6.
You will not feel like you're
exercising.
And you will see results.
I promise you.
>> I found Turbo Jam.
And I've lost 47 pounds.
And I was a size 10/12.
And now I'm sitting at a size 0.
>> It helped me to achieve the
results that I wanted that I was
not getting from other workouts,
that I was not getting from
weights, that I was not getting
from regular aerobics.
Before Turbo Jam, I was a size
12.
And my thighs were a lot bigger.
And once I started to do Turbo
Jam, I lost inches in my
thighs.
I've lost 50 pounds.
I'm now a size 6.
Turbo Jam is for anyone.
It's gonna really help your body
to get in shape.
And it doesn't take long either.
Just a few weeks and you can
notice a difference.
>> The secret to Turbo Jam is
turbo training, where I use
awesome music to lead you
through a series of high energy
bursts throughout your workout.
And I've combined that with my
Elite 11 moves that shape and
sculpt your upper body, your
lower body, and your core.
These are the moves that change
peoples' bodies.
And you won't see them in other
workouts.
They're really fun, they're
really simple, and they
concentrate, more than anything
else, on your waistline and your
abs.
Let me show you some of my Elite
11 moves.
This one's called the turbo
tuck.
And ladies, I promise you, it's
better than a tummy tuck.
'Cause you're actually gonna get
into a position that tightens
your abs.
And this is the foundation of
our Elite 11.
You're working the abs.
You're protecting the back.
And you're working the inner
thighs.
Now, you can see with the pump,
she's doing a crunch
the entire time.
It's like doing abs, but without
having to lay on the floor.
And how easy is that?
She's working the abs, she's
working the legs, she's working
the upper body, and anybody can
do this.
>> Single, single, double.
>> I love this move.
It's called the zig zag.
And as you can see, she's really
working her obliques.
I mean, this is incredible ab
work.
The legs, inner thigh, outer
thigh, and glutes.
We're lifting up the derriere at
the same time that we're working
the abs.
Now, in the twist--
Anyone can do this.
It's simple, jab, cross, jab,
knee.
When she lifts that knee
though--
Ergh!
Engaging the core.
So not only is she working the
abs, but she's lunging deep into
those legs and shaping every
area of the lower body.
Inner thigh, outer thigh,
glutes, and abs all at the same
time.
And talk about cardiovascular.
You breathing hard?
Whew!
It works.
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
may just look like a fun way to
work up a sweat.
But Chalene's breakthrough turbo
training method has actually
been scientifically proven to
burn fat and calories faster
than other cardio programs.
In fact, a major university
studied that calories burned by
popular exercise programs--
Like walking, strength training,
Pilates, step aerobics, and
running--
Turbo Jam beat them all with
an average 705 calories burned
per hour.
And some Turbo Jam participants
burned calories at a staggering
rate of over 1,000 calories an
hour.
So now you can maximize fat
loss, achieve flat, sexy abs,
and get guaranteed success.
>> Because of Turbo Jam, I was
able to lose 60 pounds, 10
inches from the waist.
And it never felt like exercise.
The music is the best music
you're ever gonna hear.
>> Music is a motivator.
I think it's primal, you know.
People have been moving to great
beats since the beginning of
time.
And it's that one thing that
at-home exercise programs have
been missing.
And this program has it.
Hook, down and up.
Imagine you're sliding your arm
across the top of a table.
>> It's different from other
home workouts.
It's really high energy.
The music is just slammin'.
>> Don't miss 
The party train 
>> The moves go right with the
music.
So everything goes well
together.
It's a perfectly choreographed,
um, program.
>> Look to the back, kick back.
>> Mama said knock you out 
>> It's a non-stop turbo party
from beginning to end.
And it just keeps the energy
level going, going, going, and
going until you don't stop.
>> Not only is it fun, you feel
like you're at a party, you feel
like you're not exercising--
But you're creating results.
You're really making your body
into a fat burning machine.
You're really sculpting your
body.
You're toning your body.
Um, it's--it's a great workout.
>> Boogie 
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
isn't just a collection of great
workout videos.
It's a complete weight loss and
body shaping system with
everything you need to burn off
the fat and sculpt a leaner,
sexier body in as little as 20
minutes a day.
And you'll never have to starve
yourself to lose weight again,
because Chalene even includes
her step-by-step eating plan,
which gives you tons of
delicious meals, a dining out
guide, and her personal favorite
recipes.
>> It's real.
I can't sell ya a diet pill.
I don't want you to go have
surgery.
I want you to do it in a way
that's gonna change your life
and make you feel better.
And that's what this program
does.
>> At my heaviest, I was close
to 210.
Since I've started Turbo Jam,
I've lost 70 pounds.
I've gone down from a size 18 to
a size 6.
>> This person right now--
This is new.
I've always been big my entire
life.
When I started Turbo Jam, I was
a size 20.
Now I'm a size 6.
Lost 75 pounds.
And I just feel great.
Now I'm probably in the best
shape of my life.
>> With Turbo Jam, I've lost 101
pounds, 10 inches in my waist.
Look at that before photo.
It's hard to believe that that
was me.
And then you look at that after
photo, and this is someone who
has experienced firsthand the
power of the Turbo Jam workout.
So just give it a shot.
And you'll be amazed at what you
can do.
>> male announcer: Every day,
more and more Turbo Jam

shrinking their waistlines,
dropping dress sizes, reshaping
their bodies, and getting lean,
sexy abs.
That's because with Turbo Jam,
you can burn:
All while rocking out to hot

fast results.
>> Thanks to Turbo Jam, I lost

>> Turbo Jam's the perfect
thing, 'cause you don't feel
like you're exercising.
>> Start it with your seven
step, go to your zig zag, do
your jab.
Didn't see that jab comin'.
I'm telling you, it's just
awesome.
>> And you wanna shake your

You burn the fat, and it's an
intensive workout.
With Turbo Jam, I lost 55
pounds.
I went from a size 40 to a 33.
And it's amazing.
>> female announcer: And when it
comes to abs, moms have it the
hardest.
But Turbo Jam is so effective,
it even helps moms get rid of
that post pregnancy pooch, proof
that anyone can get great abs
with Turbo Jam.
>> I've transformed head to toe.
With Turbo Jam, I've lost 62
pounds.
I've gone from a 22 to a size 7.
And it's amazing.
I've had two C-sections.
And they say, you know,
especially after the surgery,
it's really hard to get it back.
But the moves that they do--
You're not laying there on the
floor, doing abs for an hour.
You're moving around, having
fun.
And just every time you lift
your knee, every time you go
like this, you're getting your
whole core.
And I know I'm never gonna get
heavy again, just because I love
Turbo Jam.
I'm burning calories and having
fun.
>> I've had four kids.
And I'm 38 years old.
Every single time I have a baby,
I go back to Turbo Jam.
It's the only thing that gets me
back into shape.
I wouldn't do anything else.
>> Since starting Turbo Jam, I
lost 71 pounds.
I went from a size 20 to a size
8.
You don't have to sit on the
floor and crunch, you know,
1,000 abs a day.
You don't.
Because you're engaging your
core in every single move that
you're doing.
After having two babies and
doing this workout, this is what
it has done to my abs.
And my husband is more than
happy.
Cannot get him off me!
I can't!
>> female announcer: Whether
you're a new mom who wants flat
abs or anyone who wants to lose

her 10-day Turbo Slim Rapid
Results fitness and eating plan.
It's a guaranteed way to lose up
to 10 pounds and 10 inches in
your first 10 days or you get

But to make that claim, Chalene
had to put the Turbo Slim plan
to the test.
And the results we saw were
astonishing.
In 10 days on the Turbo Slim
program, I lost 11 3/4 inches.
I could see huge differences in
my waist and my hips.
My abdominals are unbelievable.
Abs I've never had before.
>> In 10 days, I lost an inch
off my thighs, and 10 inches
overall.
>> During my first 10 days of
the Turbo Jam, I've lost over 10
1/2 inches.
>> In 10 days, I've lost over 7
inches and 10 pounds doing Turbo
Jam.
My husband even thought, "Oh,
come on."
And he can't believe it.
I mean, he's like, "Well go
try on that bikini now."
You can do it in 10 days.
>> male announcer: Incredible
results in just 10 days or your
money back.
This is an exclusive TV offer.
You must call while there's
still time to save one full
payment and get the free upgrade
to express delivery.
So call the toll free number
now.
>> female announcer: Thousands
of people around the world have
already discovered the weight
loss and body shaping secret of
Turbo Jam.
The key is turbo training.
With turbo training, you're
working your upper body, lower
body, and your abs all at the
same time, which is why you burn
so many calories.
In fact, you can burn up to a
staggering 1,000 calories an
hour.
Best of all, it's so much fun,
you forget you're working out.
So this time, you can stick with
your workout and get lasting
results.
What makes it both fun and
incredibly effective at burning
off fat is Chalene and her Elite
11 moves.
>> This move is called the
capoeira step.
Capoeira is a form of Brazilian
martial arts that's really hot
right now in the health clubs.
It's just like you're grabbing
an imaginary opponent and
throwing him off to the side.
So not only are you gonna burn
calories, but you're gonna burn
up some stress at the same time.
She's working the legs and
tightening and toning her abs.
You're gonna see the inches come
off your waistline like never
before.
The other exercise which we
borrowed from capoeira is called
the wheel.
Legs are in that low squatting
position.
And once you're ready and you've
got the strength, we can move
on to those advanced layers
where we go a little bit deeper
into the legs, really engage the
obliques.
You can see those abs working.
The inner thigh, the outer
thigh, the glutes.
It's a total body exercise.
You will get rid of your love
handles once and for all.
It's so exciting to see that
sparkle in people's eyes when
they go, "I'm in the best shape
of my life."
>> For the first time in my
life, I was referred to as the
"skinny girl".
Since beginning Turbo Jam, I've
lost 45 pounds, gone from a size
12 to a size 4 easily.
Turbo Jam got rid of my post
pregnancy stomach.
I now have a very lean stomach
that you can see my abdominals.
But in addition to that, my
waist is smaller.
My hips are smaller.
My arms look better, they're
more shapely.
I'm just much leaner overall.
Turbo Jam works.
I would recommend it to anyone
and everyone.
>> A friend of mine who started
the program just six months
ago--
She called and left a message on
my answering machine this week.
And she said, "This is a silly
message, but my pants are
falling down.
And I'm so happy.
And I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm so excited that my pants are
falling down today."
And so for me to, you know, to
give that joy to a friend, you
know, to a close friend who had
never tried my workout before,
and to see that it could give
her that same joy was--was
really rewarding.
>> 30 years I waited to wear a
bikini.
Turbo Jam gave me that feeling
of, you know what?
Look at this.
And I put on a bikini.
I lived the first half of my
life round.
I started moving, I started
punching.
And then I started noticing the
results.
I lost 60 pounds.
It's amazing.
Now I'm long.
Now I'm lean.
Now I have a tricep.
Now I've got obliques.
Now my legs are powerful and
sexy.
And I can see the muscles in my
legs.
Turbo Jam gave me this
opportunity.
And I want other people to feel
this.
>> You've seen how Turbo Jam has
helped the people in this show.
How they've changed their lives,
not with another fad or a
gimmick, but with a proven
program that delivers real
results.
A program they love so much,
they're still doing it years
later.
Now it's your turn.
In fact, I am so sure that
you're gonna love my program,
you can try it risk-free, 30
days.
And if you don't see amazing
results, I want you to send it
back.
We'll refund your money.
But I know after one workout,
you're gonna be hooked.
So what are you waiting for?
Pick up the phone and call.

WELCOME TO ICELAND HEALTH FORUM.
>> TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO BE
TALKING ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS SUFFER
FROM ON A DAILY BASIS:
JOINT PAIN, MUSCLE PAIN
AND CHRONIC PAIN.
>> IF YOU THINK THAT YOUR LIFE
HAS TO BE AN ENDURANCE TEST OF
PAIN, THERE'S SOMEONE HERE TODAY
TO TELL YOU THAT THOSE DAYS ARE
OVER BECAUSE THERE IS A SAFE,
GENTLE SOLUTION TO ARTHRITIS
PAIN, JOINT PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES,
SORENESS AND STIFFNESS.
>> HERE TO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT
IS RENOWN MEDICAL SPECIALIST,
AUTHOR AND NOTED EXPERT IN
THE FIELDS OF JOINT PAIN AND
ARTHRITIS, DR. GARRY GORDON.
WELCOME, DR. GORDON.
>> THANK YOU.
IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH
YOU ON ICELAND HEALTH FORUM.
>> NOW, DR. GORDON, WHAT CAUSES
JOINT PAIN AND STIFFNESS?
>> THE MAJOR CAUSE IS
INFLAMMATION IN THE JOINTS AND
INFLAMMATION IN THE MUSCLES.
INFLAMMATION IS THE MAIN REASON
YOU ACHE WHEN YOU MOVE ABOUT OR
EVEN DO EVERYDAY TASKS.
>> SO WHAT DO PEOPLE DO
TO RELIEVE THE INFLAMMATION?
>> UNFORTUNATELY, MANY PEOPLE
ARE TAKING PRESCRIPTION
PAIN RELIEVERS,
BUT THESE ARE VERY HARSH
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICINES.
THEY ARE EXTREMELY HARD ON
THE BODY, AND THE HEART
IN PARTICULAR.
WHILE THEY MAY REDUCE
THE INFLAMMATION, THEY ARE
ALSO LIABLE TO CAUSE A NUMBER
OF OTHER PROBLEMS INCLUDING
HEART ATTACK.
>> SO THE CURE CAN BE WORSE
THAN THE DISEASE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?
>> SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT
THEY ARE JUST DESTINED TO LIVE
WITH PAIN, AND THERE'S NOTHING
THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT.
I'M HERE TO TELL THEM THAT
TRUE RELIEF IS FINALLY AVAILABLE
AND IT'S SAFE, GENTLE
AND WORRY-FREE.
IT'S ICELAND HEALTH
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA.@@@@
>> UPON WAKING IN THE MORNING,
I HAD TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF
THE BED FOR FIVE TO 10 MINUTES
BEFORE STANDING UP... UH, SO
I'M MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE AND IT'S
JUST, UM, MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE
WAKING UP, FACING LIFE NOW.
>> WELL, I FEEL MORE FLEXIBLE,
AND I FEEL LIKE... [EXHALES]
MY BODY DOESN'T ACHE.
>> ICELAND HEALTH JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CERTAINLY HELPS THEM,
BUT WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT DO,
DR. GORDON?
>> ICELAND HEALTH JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA IS MADE BY THE SAME
PEOPLE WHO BRING YOU THE WORLD'S
BEST-SELLING BRAND OF OMEGA-3:
ICELAND HEALTH.
THEY'VE TAKEN THEIR
PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE OMEGA-3 AND
AFTER LONG AND EXTENSIVE
RESEARCH, THEY'VE DEVELOPED
A PROPRIETARY FORMULA THAT
CONTAINS OTHER POWERFUL NATURAL
INGREDIENTS THAT ARE KNOWN
TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION, INCREASE
JOINT LUBRICATION AND
FLEXIBILITY AND BUILD CARTILAGE.
>> WHAT DOES ICELAND HEALTH 
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA CONTAIN?
>> FIRST, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CONTAINS OMEGA-3.
IT IS MADE FROM DEEP-WATER
FISH CAUGHT IN THE COLD, CLEAR
WATERS AROUND ICELAND.
THIS MEANS THEY AREN'T TAINTED
WITH UNHEALTHY LEVELS OF DIOXIN,
PCBs, PESTICIDES AND MERCURY.
IF THE FISH ARE HEALTHIER,
THAT NATURALLY MEANS THE OMEGA-3
HAS TO BE BETTER.
AND JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS MADE
WITH OMEGA-3 THAT IS THE BEST
IN TERMS OF PURITY.
IN JOINT RELIEF FORMULA, ICELAND
HEALTH HAS COMBINED THEIR
OMEGA-3 WITH COLLAGEN II.
THIS IS WHAT MAKES UP MOVEABLE
JOINTS AND PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL
OF CHONDROITIN SULFATE,
AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THAT
IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF
JOINT TISSUE.
IT ALSO CONTAINS HYALURONIC
ACID, WHICH IS THE MAJOR
COMPONENT IN JOINT LUBRICATION
FLUID THAT CUSHIONS JOINTS.
THANKS TO THE COLLAGEN 2,
THE ENZYMES THAT DESTROY
THE PROTEIN IN THE CARTILAGE
FACE MAJOR RESISTANCE.
IT ALSO LESSENS INFLAMMATION
AND PROMOTES NEW
CARTILAGE SYNTHESIS.
IN ADDITION, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CONTAINS GLUCOSAMINE
WHICH PREVENTS CARTILAGE
DESTRUCTION, SWELLING AND
LOSS OF FLEXIBILITY.
>> SO HOW DO ALL OF THESE
INGREDIENTS WORK?
>> THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT.
LET'S LOOK AT THIS SCALE MODEL
OF A KNEE JOINT.
THE OMEGA-3 REDUCES INFLAMMATION
IN THE JOINTS RIGHT IN HERE.
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN
OMEGA-3 TO BE ONE OF
NATURE'S MOST POWERFUL
ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES.
THE COLLAGEN 2 THEN SERVES
AS BUILDING BLOCK FOR
YOUR MOVEABLE JOINTS.
ITS CHONDROITIN...
GIVES YOUR JOINTS ELASTICITY AND
IT ENHANCES THE MANUFACTURE OF
HYALURONIC ACID, WHICH IS
THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN
JOINT LUBRICATION FLUID.
ON TOP OF ALL THESE
RELIEVERS AND PROTECTORS
IS GLUCOSAMINE, WHICH IS
A GUARDIAN OF CARTILAGE.
TOGETHER, THIS NATURAL MATRIX OF
PAIN RELIEF REDUCES INFLAMMATION
THAT CAUSES PAIN AND PROVIDES
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SUPPORT
FOR JOINT CONNECTIVE TISSUE
TO PREVENT FURTHER PAIN.
SO IN ESSENCE,
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS
REPAIRING AND REPLENISHING.
>> AND I DON'T NEED
A PRESCRIPTION FOR ICELAND
HEALTH JOINT RELIEF FORMULA?
>> NOT AT ALL, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA IS COMPLETELY NATURAL
AND GENTLE, YET REMARKABLY
EFFECTIVE ON JOINT PAIN AND
MUSCLE PAIN AS WELL.
IN FACT, OVER TIME, ICELAND
HEALTH JOINT RELIEF FORMULA WILL
NATURALLY HELP YOU FEEL LESS AND
LESS PAIN BECAUSE THE CAUSES OF
THE PAIN ARE BEING ELIMINATED.
>> AND JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS
SAFER THAN VIOXX, BEXTRA,
CELEBREX, ALEVE AND THOSE TYPES
OF PRESCRIPTION PAIN RELIEVERS?
>> ICELAND HEALTH JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA IS TOTALLY SAFE.
NOT ONLY ARE YOU RELIEVING THE
PAIN, YOU'RE ALSO RELIEVING YOUR
ANXIETIES ABOUT PAIN RELIEVERS.
AND HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW: OMEGA-3 IN
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA IS NOT JUST
REDUCING INFLAMMATION BUT ALSO
REMOVING ARTERIAL PLAQUE AND
IMPROVING YOUR CIRCULATION.
SO IT'S PROTECTING YOUR HEART
WHILE IT'S RELIEVING PAIN.
>> SO IN ICELAND HEALTH JOINT
RELIEF FORMULA, YOU HAVE OMEGA-3
WHICH REDUCES INFLAMMATION AND
IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.
THERE'S COLLAGEN II WHICH
CONTAINS CHONDROITIN AND
HYALURONIC ACID, BOTH OF
WHICH ARE NATURAL SUBSTANCES
THAT IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF
YOUR JOINTS, AND GLUCOSAMINE,
WHICH PREVENTS CARTILAGE
DESTRUCTION, SWELLING AND LOSS
OF FLEXIBILITY.
>> VERY GOOD.
>> DOCTOR, UM, HOW ABOUT SPORTS
INJURIES-- THINGS LIKE MUSCLE
ACHES AND, UM, ACHING JOINTS?
>> GINGER NEEDS, UH, SOMETHING
FOR HER TENNIS ELBOW.
>> WELL, GINGER, LOOK AT IT THIS
WAY-- IF ICELAND HEALTH JOINT
RELIEF FORMULA CAN BE EFFECTIVE
ON SEVERE JOINT PAIN, JUST
IMAGINE HOW WELL IT CAN WORK ON
EVERYDAY MUSCLE ACHES AS WELL AS
THE SORENESS YOU FEEL AFTER
WORKING OUT, OR IN YOUR CASE,
PLAYING A HARD GAME OF TENNIS.
>> BUT WILL IT IMPROVE
MY BACKHAND?
>> GINGER, TRY THIS.
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE
TO LOSE IS YOUR PAIN.
>> I HAD THE BEGINNINGS OF
ARTHRITIS IN MY RIGHT HAND.
I COULD BARELY PUT MY MAKEUP
ON... OR WRITE.
I WAS EVEN HAVING TROUBLE
TYPING ON THE COMPUTER.
THE ARTHRITIS HAS DISAPPEARED
INSIDE OF THREE MONTHS.
>> I'D DONE SOME DAMAGE TO
THE JOINT IN MY THUMB AND
I WAS GETTING TO WHERE
I COULDN'T, LITERALLY COULDN'T
PICK UP THINGS.
I MEAN, THE PAIN, BUT JUST
THE STRENGTH WASN'T THERE
BECAUSE WHATEVER I'VE DONE,
AND I HADN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO SEE A DOCTOR ABOUT IT.
SINCE I'VE TAKEN ICELAND
HEALTH, I, UH, HAVE SEEN
THE STRENGTH COME BACK.
IT SEEMS TO BE LITERALLY AS
STRONG AS THE OTHER ONE NOW.
>> MY WORKOUTS ARE
PRETTY INTENSE.
THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF TEARS IN
THE BODY BASE IN THE DIFFERENT
MOVEMENTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
DO MARTIAL ARTS.
I NOTICED A TREMENDOUS CHANGE
IN, IN THE WAY MY BODY FEELS.
MY BODY FEELS GREAT.
IT'S JUST LIKE PUTTING OIL
IN A CAR.
>> SINCE TAKING THE ICELAND
HEALTH PRODUCT, I HAVE FELT
MORE INVIGORATED.
I HAVE HAD A BETTER SENSE OF
WELLNESS, I'VE BEEN HAPPIER.
I'VE BEEN EXERCISING MORE,
WHICH MAKES ME FEEL HAPPIER.

>> WELCOME BACK TO
ICELAND HEALTH FORUM.
WE'RE HERE TODAY DISCUSSING
A TOPIC THAT EVERYONE CAN
IDENTIFY WITH-- PAIN,
PARTICULARLY JOINT PAIN.
>> AND NOW THERE'S A NEW WAY
TO RELIEVE THIS PAIN SAFELY,
GENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY.
>> OUR GUEST TODAY IS
DR. GARRY GORDON AND HE'S HERE
TO TELL US ALL ABOUT THIS
REMARKABLE NEW FORM OF PAIN
RELIEF THAT IS NOT ONLY
RELIEVING PAIN,
BUT THE ANXIETIES ABOUT
OBTAINING COMFORT.
WELCOME, DR. GORDON.
>> THANK YOU, IT'S MY PLEASURE
TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE
THIS VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE WITH
YOU AND YOUR VIEWERS.
>> SO, DR. GORDON, YOU'VE TALKED
ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
OMEGA-3s AND ESPECIALLY IN
THE NEW ICELAND HEALTH
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA.
>> REMEMBER, EFFECTIVENESS
IS ONE THING, BUT FINDING
A SAFE, GENTLE PAIN RELIEVER
IS SOMETHING ELSE.
THAT'S WHERE ICELAND HEALTH
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA COMES IN.
>> DOCTOR, AREN'T THERE MANY
FORMS OF OMEGA-3 AVAILABLE THAT
OUR VIEWERS CAN TAKE?
>> YES, THERE ARE A VARIETY
OF TYPES OF OMEGA-3, BUT TO
BORROW A CORNY CLICHE, NOT ALL
OMEGA-3s ARE CREATED EQUAL.
>> HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT?
>> WELL, YOU CAN GET OMEGA-3
FROM FLAXSEED, BUT THE BODY
ABSORBS ONLY 10% OF OMEGA-3
IN FLAX.
>> WELL, SO MUCH
FOR MY FLAXSEED.
[GINGER LAUGHS]
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU FIND IN
ICELAND HEALTH JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA, THE BODY ABSORBS 90%
OF IT, PLUS-- AND THIS IS VERY
IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF YOUR
VIEWERS TO KNOW-- THE PURITY OF
THE OMEGA-3 THAT YOU ABSORB IS
VERY IMPORTANT.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE.
>> OH, THERE ARE BIG
DIFFERENCES IN PURITY.
ICELAND HEALTH IS FAMOUS FOR
THEIR OMEGA-3 BECAUSE
IT'S PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE.
PLUS, ALL HARMFUL MATERIALS
THAT MIGHT BE PRESENT SUCH AS
MERCURY, PCBs AND OTHER TOXINS
ARE COMPLETELY REMOVED.
>> SO NOT ONLY IS ICELAND
HEALTH JOINT RELIEF FORMULA
FAR SAFER THAN PRESCRIPTION
PAIN RELIEVERS, IT ALSO
CONTAINS PURE OMEGA-3?
>> CORRECT... IF YOU'RE TAKING
THE PUREST OMEGA-3 YOU CAN FIND,
THEN IT HELPS INCREASE
THE EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING
INFLAMMATION THAT CAUSES
JOINT PAIN.
>> WELL, IT MAKES SENSE TO ME,
BUT IS THERE ANY PROOF THAT
OMEGA-3 ACTUALLY REDUCES
INFLAMMATION AND RELIEVES PAIN?
>> LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE.
RENOWNED INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALL
REPORTED THAT OMEGA-3 IS A SAFE
WAY TO REDUCE JOINT PAIN,
PLUS REDUCE RISK OF CORONARY
HEART DISEASE AND BLOOD
CLOTTING, PROMOTE HEALTHY
HEART FUNCTION, AND SLOW
HARDENING OF THE ARTERIES.
BY REDUCING INFLAMMATION,
CHOLESTEROL IS LOWERED,
CIRCULATION IMPROVES AND HEART
ATTACKS ARE PREVENTED.
IN JOINT RELIEF FORMULA, ICELAND
HEALTH HAS COMBINED THEIR
OMEGA-3 WITH COLLAGEN II.
THIS IS WHAT MAKES UP MOVEABLE
JOINTS AND PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL
OF CHONDROITIN SULFATE, AN
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THAT IMPROVES
THE QUALITY OF JOINT TISSUE.
IT ALSO CONTAINS HYALURONIC ACID
WHICH IS THE MAJOR COMPONENT
IN JOINT LUBRICATION FLUID
THAT CUSHIONS JOINTS.
THANKS TO THE COLLAGEN II,
THE ENZYMES THAT DESTROY
THE PROTEIN IN CARTILAGE
FACE MAJOR RESISTANCE.
IT ALSO LESSENS INFLAMMATION
AND PROMOTES NEW
CARTILAGE SYNTHESIS.
IN ADDITION, JOINT RELIEF
FORMULA CONTAINS GLUCOSAMINE,
WHICH PREVENTS CARTILAGE
DESTRUCTION, SWELLING AND
LOSS OF FLEXIBILITY.
>> THE PAIN HAS
DEFINITELY SUBSIDED.
>> I HAVE FELT MORE
INVIGORATED, I HAVE HAD
A BETTER SENSE OF WELLNESS.
I'VE BEEN HAPPIER.
I'VE BEEN EXERCISING MORE,
WHICH MAKES ME FEEL HAPPIER.
>> AND OVER TIME, ICELAND HEALTH
JOINT RELIEF FORMULA WILL
NATURALLY HELP YOU FEEL LESS AND
LESS PAIN BECAUSE THE CAUSES OF
THE PAIN ARE BEING ELIMINATED.
>> THAT'S REMARKABLE.
>> I'D SAY IT'S AMAZING.
>> WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME IS THAT
MORE PEOPLE AREN'T TAKING IT.
>> WELL, ICELAND HEALTH JOINT
RELIEF FORMULA IS BRAND-NEW AND
HAS NEVER BEEN AVAILABLE IN
THE UNITED STATES UNTIL NOW.
>> IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT
HOW TO GET THIS REMARKABLE
PAIN RELIEF BEYOND PRESCRIPTION,
WATCH THIS.
>> I LIKE THE FACT THAT
IT'S COMING FROM ICELAND.
I FEEL THAT IT'S PROBABLY
A PLACE THAT HAS VERY
LITTLE POLLUTION, UM,
THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCT IS
A PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE.
>> MY HUSBAND WAS GETTING
ARTHRITIS IN HIS LEFT FOOT,
WHICH WAS A GREAT
PROBLEM BECAUSE HE'S
A LONG-DISTANCE BIKER.
IT WAS ALSO A GREAT PROBLEM
BECAUSE IT WAS A SOURCE OF
EMBARRASSMENT FOR ME BECAUSE
IF WE WERE TO GO OUT TO DINNER,
HE COULD ONLY WEAR A SLIPPER.
HE WANTED TO WEAR FLIP FLOPS
ON HIS LEFT FOOT.
AND I... HAVE NOTICED THAT SINCE
HE'S BEEN TAKING OMEGA-3, HE HAS
STARTED WEARING HIS SNEAKERS
AGAIN, WITH LACES, AND WHEN WE
WENT OUT TO DINNER THE OTHER
NIGHT, HE WAS ABLE TO WEAR A
HARD LEATHER SHOE WITH A BUCKLE.
ALSO, HIS ARTHRITIS, THE GREAT
PAIN THAT HE HAD IN HIS LEFT
FOOT HAS JUST ABOUT DISAPPEARED,
AND HE IS... WINNING RACES
FOR LONG-DISTANCE BIKING.
IT'S TRUE.
>> I'VE BEEN TAKING IT FOR SIX
MONTHS, AND HONESTLY, MOST OF
MY PAINS ARE GONE.
>> I'VE DEFINITELY NOTICED
A DIFFERENCE.
MY KNEE, UM, I HAVE LESS PAIN IN
MY KNEE AND I'M ABLE TO DANCE
A LOT MORE THAN I DID, LIKE,
A YEAR AGO, AND I DEFINITELY
FEEL THAT, YOU KNOW, I CAN DO
A MUCH FASTER PACE AND KEEP UP
WITH MY DANCING THAN I DID
PRIOR TO TAKING IT.
>> I'VE BEEN TAKING IT NOW FOR
ABOUT A MONTH, AND MY JOINTS
ARE DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY
MORE FLEXIBLE.
I CAN BEND OVER... NO PAIN IN
THE BACK ANYMORE, THE KNEES.
I, I DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND
THE PRODUCT.
>> MY ENERGY LEVEL IS GREAT,
I'M ABLE TO SWIM 50 LAPS EVERY
DAY IN THE POOL.
I COULDN'T DO THAT BEFORE.
>> I HAD SOME JOINT PAIN IN
MY KNEES... NOT VERY MUCH,
BUT GOING UP AND DOWN STAIRS,
I WOULD FEEL IT.
AND I DON'T FEEL IT ANYMORE.
IT'S WONDERFUL. [LAUGHS]

>> OUR FRIENDS CAME HERE.
THEY WERE GUARANTEED TO MOVE TO
FLORIDA THREE WEEKS AGO.
MY HUSBAND SAID, "OH, YOU MUST

BOUGHT A NEW HOUSE THREE BLOCKS

A GREATER RANGE OF ROTATIONAL
MOTION ON EVERY REP.

WE WANTED TO INTRODUCE RED TO
THE TOUGHEST GROUP WE COULD
THINK OF... A GROUP OF
FIREFIGHTERS.
THESE GUYS KNOW ALL ABOUT USING
EQUIPMENT TO GET A JOB DONE.
AT FIRST, THEY WERE SKEPTICAL...
>> THERE IS NOTHING MORE BORING
IN THE WORLD THAN WORKING OUT.
>> REAL TEST IS TO GET IT
PAST US.
WE TEND TO BE HARD ON STUFF.
>> Announcer: ...UNTIL THEY
TRIED IT.
>> FEELS GOOD.
>> IT'S PRETTY SOLID.
>> IT'S REALLY SMOOTH.
IT MOVES VERY EASILY.
IT'S PRETTY COOL. [CHUCKLES]
>> I WEIGH 250 POUNDS.
THIS IS SUPPORTING ME JUST FINE.
>> ONCE YOU GET GOING, YOU CAN
START FEELING IT.
ON THE SIDES, DEFINITELY.
>> HOO, THERE IT IS!
>> YEAH, YOU CAN FEEL IT
BURNING RIGHT HERE.
>> WELL, I'M FEELING IT IN
MY LOWER ABS, AND I'M ALSO
FEELING IT IN MY OBLIQUES.
[GEAR CRANKS]
>> THE CORE AND ALL THE WAY IN
TO THE BACK, YOU CAN FEEL IT.
THE MORE YOU DO IT, YOU START
FEELING THE BURN.
IT FEELS GOOD.
>> SEE, I CAN, I CAN FEEL IT
HERE BUT I CAN ALSO FEEL IT
A LITTLE MORE IN MY HIPS, TOO.
IT'LL BE A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> YOU CAN GET A GOOD WORKOUT
OUT OF THIS.
>> IT'S A NICE,
LOW-IMPACT WORKOUT.
I CAN BORROW IT FOR ABOUT SIX
WEEKS, SEE HOW... [LAUGHTER]
>> IT IS QUICK, YOU KNOW,
AND IT DOES DO ALL THE THINGS
THAT THEY'RE SAYING.
>> Man: SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ON
TO SOMETHING, MAN.
[...]
>> TOP FITNESS TRAINERS HAVE
KNOWN ABOUT THE CORE SCULPTING
POWER OF ROTATIONAL EXERCISES
FOR YEARS, BUT IT'S BEEN HARD
TO DO UNTIL NOW.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO FITNESS
PROFESSIONALS THINK OF RED?
WE TOOK IT TO SOME OF AMERICA'S
FINEST TRAINERS AND EXERCISE
PHYSIOLOGISTS AND ASKED
FOR THEIR OPINIONS.
>> I LOVE RED.
IT'S DONE A LOT FOR MY BACK AND
NECK, AND IT'S HELPED MY CORE
STRENGTH TREMENDOUSLY.
THE RESULTS I'VE SEEN... UH,
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED
RED HAVE BEEN TRULY AMAZING.
IT'S THE BEST ABDOMINAL
EXERCISER I HAVE EVER USED.
>> SO WITH RED, YOU'RE GETTING
ALL AREAS OF THE ABS.
YOU'RE GETTING THE OBLIQUES,
YOU'RE GETTING THE UPPER AB, YOU
GET THE LOWER AB, YOU'RE GETTING
THE WHOLE CENTRAL ABDOMINAL
MUSCLES, NOT JUST STRICTLY
ISOLATING ONE SMALL SECTION LIKE
THE OLD-FASHIONED AB CRUNCHERS
WHERE YOU'RE JUST COMING
STRAIGHT FORWARD AND BACK DOWN.
SO YOU BASICALLY GET A FULL
ABDOMINAL WORKOUT, HITTING
ALL AREAS OF YOUR AB MUSCLES
WITH RED.
>> WELL, WE'RE RAISING OUR HEART
RATE, WE'RE HELPING TO CIRCULATE
AND STIMULATE THE BLOOD FLOW.
I THINK RED WOULD WORK FOR
JUST ABOUT ANYONE.
>> RED IS GREAT FOR THE LOWER
ABS, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN.
UM, A LOT OF CLIENTS THAT
I HAVE WHO'VE HAD BABIES,
THIS IS GREAT.
IT REALLY GETS DEEP IN THERE,
WORKS THE CORE MUSCLES OF
THE LOWER PART OF THE ABS.
RED IS EASY.
YOU'LL GET YOUR RESULTS.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL IT IN
MY ABDOMINALS, AND I CAN ALSO
FEEL IT IN MY ARMS.
I WORK OUT ALL THE TIME AND
I CAN FEEL THIS MORE
THAN ANYTHING.
DOES IT WORK? ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE KEYS TO RAPID RESULTS ARE
A FULL RANGE OF MOTION AND USING
RESISTANCE TRAINING.
RED INVOLVES ALL OF YOUR CORE
ABDOMINAL MUSCLES TO GET THAT
RICH RANGE OF MOTION THAT
DELIVERS RESULTS.
AS YOU ROTATE ON RED,
YOUR ABS AND CORE MUSCLES
ARE BEING ACTIVATED--
FROM THE HIPS AND BACK TO
OBLIQUES TO CENTER ABS TO
OBLIQUES AND THEN YOUR BACK.
THAT'S 360 DEGREES OF CORE
ABDOMINAL TONING THAT'S
WHITTLING DOWN YOUR WAISTLINE.
>> Gary: AND WHEN RESISTANCE IS
ADDED TO THE FORMULA, THE
RESULTS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
>> BEFORE I STARTED RED, I WAS
FLABBY AND NASTY. [LAUGHS]
I WOULD WEAR BULKY CLOTHES.
AFTER USING RED AND LOSING
THE INCHES AND THE WEIGHT, I
WEAR CLOTHES THAT, YOU KNOW, FIT
ME, THAT SHOW OFF MY BODY AND IT
GOT MY WAIST DOWN SIX INCHES.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> MY STOMACH WAS HUGE.
IT WAS HUGE.
IT WAS, UH, JUST KIND
OF DISGUSTING.
WHEN I USE RED FITNESS, I,
I CAN JUST FEEL IT RIGHT...
I CAN FEEL IT AND I KNOW
IT'S WORKING.
THESE RESULTS FROM USING RED
FITNESS WERE GREAT.
>> WHY HAVEN'T EXERCISE MACHINES
KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES IN TERMS
OF COMFORT?
OUR CAR SEATS, OUR HOME AND
OFFICE FURNITURE-- EVERYTHING
TODAY IS BUILT TO BE COMFORTABLE
EXCEPT FITNESS MACHINES.
>> LET'S FACE IT: A LOT OF
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT ISN'T EASY
FOR BIGGER PEOPLE TO USE.
BUT RED'S PADDED MEMORY FOAM
SEAT CUSHION IS EXTRA WIDE AND
IT'S SOFT AND COMFY.
WHEN THE EXERCISE IS EASY
ON YOUR BODY, YOU CAN
CONCENTRATE ON WORKING OUT
WITHOUT DISTRACTION AND
WITHOUT DISCOMFORT.
>> Announcer: SO WHAT DO REGULAR
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT RED?
WELL, WE TOOK IT TO 
LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA
TO FIND OUT.
>> THIS IS CUSHIONY, DOES NOT
HURT YOUR BUTT LIKE SITTING ON
A WOOD FLOOR.
>> YOU GOT A LOT OF "CUSH"...
A CUSH FOR THE TUSH. [LAUGHS]
>> YOU COULD SIT HERE AND WATCH
TV WHILE YOU DO IT. [LAUGHS]
>> WOW, THIS FEELS GREAT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S WORKING ALL OF
THE RIGHT MUSCLES.
>> I'M FEELING IT HERE...
AND DOWN LOWER, TOO.
>> I'M STARTING TO FEEL
THE BURN.
>> I'M FEELING THIS BURN HERE
PRETTY FAST DOING THIS.
>> Man: YEAH, IT'S WORKING,
I CAN FEEL IT.
>> YOU CAN FEEL 'EM FLEXING AND
TIGHTENING RIGHT HERE IN
THE FRONT AND THEN ON THE SIDES.
>> I FEEL IN MY LOWER STOMACH.
>> I FEEL IT IN MY STOMACH.
>> MY STOMACH, RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE. >> HERE.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> RIGHT AROUND,
RIGHT AROUND HERE.
ON THE SIDES DOWN HERE.
>> I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL HOW IT
ISOLATES THE MUSCLES.
>> THAT LOWER, VERY LOWER AB.
>> I REALLY LIKE IT.
IT'S GOOD.
>> IT'S VERY GOOD.
>> IT'S EASY TO DO,
IT'S COMFORTABLE.
I LIKE IT, IT JUST FEELS GOOD.
>> YOU FEEL IT ALL THE WAY
AROUND YOUR WAIST, YOU FEEL IT
DOWN THE FRONT.
'CAUSE YOU CAN TELL
I'M BREATHING. [LAUGHS]
IT'S A GOOD WORKOUT.
>> I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOING
TO GET MY SIX PACK BACK.
>> RED'S EASY ON YOUR BODY AND
IT'S ALSO EASY TO USE.
YOUR BACK REMAINS STRAIGHT AND
RELAXED BECAUSE THE VERTEBRAE IN
YOUR BACK ARE IN THE IDEAL,
RELAXED NEUTRAL POSITION.
YOU GRAB HOLD OF THE HANDLES
WHICH ADJUST TO MATCH YOUR ARM
LENGTH, AND NOW YOU JUST ROTATE
RIGHT AND LEFT AND RIGHT
AND LEFT.
AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN YOUR
ROTATION, DIFFERENT ABS AND CORE
MUSCLES ARE RECRUITED,
SO BY DOING ONE FULL REP,
YOU TONE AND STRENGTHEN ALL YOUR
CORE MUSCLES.
YOU'VE TONED YOUR WAISTLINE
ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR THAT
360-DEGREE TONING.
THE KEY IS YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BEND YOUR BACK OVER TO WORK
THE ABS.
YOU SIMPLY TWIST YOUR TORSO
TO ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER.
COMPARE THIS TO THE CRUNCHES ON
ONE OF THOSE EXERCISE BALLS.
THOSE ARE SO HARD TO USE AND
TO BALANCE ON.
EVEN SMALL, SHORT TWISTS LIKE
THIS ARE FIRING OFF AB MUSCLES
ACROSS THE CORE AND HERE IN
THE CENTER OF THE ABS AND ACROSS
THE ABDOMEN.
>> Gary: MAKE RED YOUR FAVORITE
COLOR, LIKE THESE WOMEN WHO TAKE
BODY SLIMMING VERY SERIOUSLY.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING...]
>> MANY OF THE MOVEMENTS
IN DANCE DO DEAL WITH
CIRCULAR MOVEMENT.
OUR DANCERS HAVE TO HAVE
THE SAME MOVEMENT THAT RED HAS
SO THAT THE BODY CAN MOVE
FORWARD, SIDE, BACK AND SIDE.
IT ELONGATES ALL THE MUSCLES
AROUND THE WAISTLINE AND IN
THE UPPER BACK AND THE,
AND THE SHOULDERS.
>> I DANCE AND WORK OUT FOUR TO
FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
RED IS A VERY EFFECTIVE MACHINE.
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY ABDOMINALS,
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY CORE AND
THE RESISTANCE THAT IT TAKES IS
ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT ON MY SPINE
OR MY NECK.
I THINK THE RESULTS YOU WOULD
GET WITH THIS MACHINE WOULD
CERTAINLY BE BENEFICIAL TO
A DANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE
STRETCHING AND HAVING RESISTANCE
AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE
BUILDING STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.
WITH RED, THIS IS VERY
COMFORTABLE TO DO.
I CAN PUT THIS IN MY DEN WHILE
MY KIDS ARE PLAYING AND
WATCH SHOWS WITH THEM AND
DO THIS WORKOUT.
RED IS DECEIVING 'CAUSE IF YOU
JUST LOOK AT IT, IT LOOKS LIKE
A STOOL.
I... WHEN I SAW IT, I SAID,
"WELL, WHERE IS THE MACHINE?"
AND THEY SAID,
"IT'S RIGHT THERE."
AND I SAID, "WHERE?"
AND THEY SAID, "RIGHT THERE,
THAT RED... THE RED IS
THE MACHINE."
AND I SAID, "WELL, HOW DOES
IT WORK?"
IT AND YOU GO SIDE TO SIDE,"
AND IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND IT IS
NOT DIFFICULT, ALTHOUGH
IT'S EFFECTIVE.
I CAN TOTALLY FEEL IT.
I DO LIKE RED.
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT RED,
I THINK IT'S A GREAT MACHINE.
I THINK THAT IT'S SO SMALL AND
IT'S EASY TO FIT IN YOUR HOME.
IT WON'T TAKE UP ROOM.
I THINK... MOSTLY, I THINK
THE RESULTS THAT I'M GOING
TO SEE ARE GONNA BE FANTASTIC.
>> MOST PEOPLE STOP USING
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY
FIND WORKING OUT UNCOMFORTABLE.
THEY GET DISCOURAGED AND QUIT.
BUT WITH RED, WE GUARANTEE
THAT IT'S THE MOST COMFORTABLE
WORKOUT THAT YOU MAY
EVER EXPERIENCE.
THERE'S NO IMPACT ON THE JOINTS,
AND BEST OF ALL, RED'S SMOOTH
MOVEMENT WORKS OUT YOUR CORE
ABDOMINALS THOROUGHLY.
YOU COULD BE BURNING HUNDREDS OF
CALORIES AND SLIMMING DOWN YOUR
MIDSECTION WHILE WATCHING YOUR
FAVORITE TV SHOW, AND YOU WON'T
HAVE TO CRANK UP THE SOUND
BECAUSE RED IS VIRTUALLY SILENT,
NOT LIKE THOSE NOISY TREADMILLS
AND CARDIO BIKES.
RED IS THE COMFORTABLE WAY
TO SLIM DOWN, AND TALKING ABOUT
SLIM, RED DOES NOT TAKE UP
AN ENTIRE ROOM LIKE OTHER BULKY
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT.
USE IT IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR
BEDROOM OR IN THE DEN, AND WHEN
YOU'RE DONE, RED STORES UNDER
YOUR BED IN SECONDS.
RED IS THAT ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
EXERCISE MACHINE THAT'S
COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO USE.
IT'S A SERIOUS WORKOUT THAT'S
EASY ON YOUR BODY.
RED GETS RESULTS.
>> I LOST SEVEN AND A HALF
INCHES OFF MY WAIST IN
EIGHT WEEKS.
THAT'S ALMOST AN INCH A WEEK.
THESE ARE MY OLD PANTS.
AND... THEY'RE HUGE!
I USED TO... I FIT IN THESE
EIGHT WEEKS AGO.
THIS MEANS MORE THAN A SCALE
WILL EVER MEAN, WHEN YOU CAN
GRAB YOUR PANTS... AND DO THAT,
AND KNOW THAT... THEY'RE HUGE.
YOU CAN'T WEAR THEM ANYMORE.
THESE ARE PRETTY
DRAMATIC RESULTS.
THE BEST PART OF THIS IS
WHEN PEOPLE NOTICE.
THEY SAY, "YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT!"
AND THAT'S SO EXCITING
TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY.
>> I LOST FIVE AND A HALF INCHES
OFF MY HIPS, NINE INCHES OFF
MY WAIST, ALL THAT USING RED.
AND ALL THAT WITHIN TWO MONTHS.
NINE INCHES AROUND MY WAIST IS
A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ME
BECAUSE BEFORE, IT JUST,
LIKE, STAYED THERE...
I'LL LOSE THE WEIGHT,
BIGGER ON THE WAIST.
BUT NOW WITH RED, THAT'S GONE.
THESE PANTS USED TO FIT
FAIRLY WELL.
THEY WERE NICE AND COMFORTABLE.
IT LOOKS LIKE A CLOWN OUTFIT.
NOW, I CAN'T EVEN WEAR
THESE ANYMORE.
I MEAN, IT'S HUGE... I MEAN,
TO THE POINT WHERE IF I DON'T
WEAR A BELT, THEY PRETTY MUCH,
LIKE, FALL DOWN TO MY ANKLE.
AND ALL THIS BECAUSE OF RED.
I'M ECSTATIC ABOUT IT, ACTUALLY.
>> WRITE DOWN THIS PHONE NUMBER
AND CALL RIGHT NOW AND PUT AN
EXCITING NEW SPIN ON YOUR ABS
WORKOUT WITH RED.
IT'S HOT, IT WORKS.

Would it be okay if I sat here?
Is she serious?
Whatever!
New girl!
Words can't bring me down.

The music's incredible.
The moves are easy.
And they get you the results you

>> Boom boom boom 
To the open room 
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
was created by world-renowned
fitness expert:
As a wife and working mother of
two, Chalene developed Turbo Jam
as a fitness solution that fit
into her own busy lifestyle.
Since then, Chalene has appeared
in more than 50 fitness videos.
She's become an international
fitness celebrity, a
sought-after health and fitness
writer, and:
>> male announcer: Now Chalene
has taken her red-hot health
club workout to an even higher
level and turned it into one of
the most effective video-based
weight loss and fitness programs
ever.
In fact, it's proven to:
And it's so effective, you're
guaranteed to lose up to 10
pounds and 10 inches in your
first 10 days or your money
back.
>> In 10 days, I've lost over
10 pounds and over 10 inches.
And overall, Turbo Jam's helped
me lose over 70 pounds and five
dress sizes.
>> female announcer: No matter
what your age or fitness level--
>> Turbo Jam is for everyone.
>> It doesn't matter what age
you are whether you are 12 or
60.
>> I love the music.
It's funky.
>> female announcer: Whether you
need to lose 5 pounds or 105
pounds, Turbo Jam is the answer.
>> Lost 15 pounds.
When from a size 10 to a size 6
and just feel completely
energized.
>> With Turbo Jam, I've lost 101
pounds, 10 inches in my waist,
gained an enormous amount of
energy.
>> female announcer: And

without ever even hitting the

>> And it just really, honestly,

So you're getting tight abs
without having to lie on the

those old yucky crunches.
>> male announcer: Coming up,

and learn how her exciting new
program can help you drop the
unwanted pounds and inches and
transform your own body quickly
and easily.
>> female announcer: Best of

Get ready for:
>> female announcer: Thousands
of people from around the world
have already experienced
incredible results with Turbo
Jam.
That's because this fun,
innovative combination of
cardio, kickboxing, and dance
set to awesome music actually
makes losing weight fun.
Anyone can follow along and get
fast results.
In fact, you're guaranteed to
lose up to 10 pounds and 10
inches in your first 10 days.
But more importantly, this is a
program you'll want to keep
doing so you can shed all those
unwanted pounds and inches and
totally reshape your body.
>> Thanks to Turbo Jam, I have
lost 25 pounds, 10 1/2 inches
all over my body.
I went from a size 10.
Now I'm back into a size 6.
You will not feel like you're
exercising.
And you will see results.
I promise you.
>> I found Turbo Jam.
And I've lost 47 pounds.
And I was a size 10/12.
And now I'm sitting at a size 0.
>> It helped me to achieve the
results that I wanted that I was
not getting from other workouts,
that I was not getting from
weights, that I was not getting
from regular aerobics.
Before Turbo Jam, I was a size
12.
And my thighs were a lot bigger.
And once I started to do Turbo
Jam, I lost inches in my
thighs.
I've lost 50 pounds.
I'm now a size 6.
Turbo Jam is for anyone.
It's gonna really help your body
to get in shape.
And it doesn't take long either.
Just a few weeks and you can
notice a difference.
>> The secret to Turbo Jam is
turbo training, where I use
awesome music to lead you
through a series of high energy
bursts throughout your workout.
And I've combined that with my
Elite 11 moves that shape and
sculpt your upper body, your
lower body, and your core.
These are the moves that change
peoples' bodies.
And you won't see them in other
workouts.
They're really fun, they're
really simple, and they
concentrate, more than anything
else, on your waistline and your
abs.
Let me show you some of my Elite
11 moves.
This one's called the turbo
tuck.
And ladies, I promise you, it's
better than a tummy tuck.
'Cause you're actually gonna get
into a position that tightens
your abs.
And this is the foundation of
our Elite 11.
You're working the abs.
You're protecting the back.
And you're working the inner
thighs.
Now, you can see with the pump,
she's doing a crunch
the entire time.
It's like doing abs, but without
having to lay on the floor.
And how easy is that?
She's working the abs, she's
working the legs, she's working
the upper body, and anybody can
do this.
>> Single, single, double.
>> I love this move.
It's called the zig zag.
And as you can see, she's really
working her obliques.
I mean, this is incredible ab
work.
The legs, inner thigh, outer
thigh, and glutes.
We're lifting up the derriere at
the same time that we're working
the abs.
Now, in the twist--
Anyone can do this.
It's simple, jab, cross, jab,
knee.
When she lifts that knee
though--
Ergh!
Engaging the core.
So not only is she working the
abs, but she's lunging deep into
those legs and shaping every
area of the lower body.
Inner thigh, outer thigh,
glutes, and abs all at the same
time.
And talk about cardiovascular.
You breathing hard?
Whew!
It works.
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
may just look like a fun way to
work up a sweat.
But Chalene's breakthrough turbo
training method has actually
been scientifically proven to
burn fat and calories faster
than other cardio programs.
In fact, a major university
studied that calories burned by
popular exercise programs--
Like walking, strength training,
Pilates, step aerobics, and
running--
Turbo Jam beat them all with
an average 705 calories burned
per hour.
And some Turbo Jam participants
burned calories at a staggering
rate of over 1,000 calories an
hour.
So now you can maximize fat
loss, achieve flat, sexy abs,
and get guaranteed success.
>> Because of Turbo Jam, I was
able to lose 60 pounds, 10
inches from the waist.
And it never felt like exercise.
The music is the best music
you're ever gonna hear.
>> Music is a motivator.
I think it's primal, you know.
People have been moving to great
beats since the beginning of
time.
And it's that one thing that
at-home exercise programs have
been missing.
And this program has it.
Hook, down and up.
Imagine you're sliding your arm
across the top of a table.
>> It's different from other
home workouts.
It's really high energy.
The music is just slammin'.
>> Don't miss 
The party train 
>> The moves go right with the
music.
So everything goes well
together.
It's a perfectly choreographed,
um, program.
>> Look to the back, kick back.
>> Mama said knock you out 
>> It's a non-stop turbo party
from beginning to end.
And it just keeps the energy
level going, going, going, and
going until you don't stop.
>> Not only is it fun, you feel
like you're at a party, you feel
like you're not exercising--
But you're creating results.
You're really making your body
into a fat burning machine.
You're really sculpting your
body.
You're toning your body.
Um, it's--it's a great workout.
>> Boogie 
>> female announcer: Turbo Jam
isn't just a collection of great
workout videos.
It's a complete weight loss and
body shaping system with
everything you need to burn off
the fat and sculpt a leaner,
sexier body in as little as 20

And you'll never have to starve
yourself to lose weight again,
because Chalene even includes
her step-by-step eating plan,
which gives you tons of
delicious meals, a dining out
guide, and her personal favorite
recipes.
>> It's real.
I can't sell ya a diet pill.
I don't want you to go have
surgery.
I want you to do it in a way
that's gonna change your life
and make you feel better.
And that's what this program
does.
>> At my heaviest, I was close
to 210.
Since I've started Turbo Jam,
I've lost 70 pounds.
I've gone down from a size 18 to
a size 6.
>> This person right now--
This is new.
I've always been big my entire
life.
When I started Turbo Jam, I was
a size 20.
Now I'm a size 6.
Lost 75 pounds.
And I just feel great.
Now I'm probably in the best
shape of my life.
>> With Turbo Jam, I've lost 101
pounds, 10 inches in my waist.
Look at that before photo.
It's hard to believe that that
was me.
And then you look at that after
photo, and this is someone who
has experienced firsthand the
power of the Turbo Jam workout.
So just give it a shot.
And you'll be amazed at what you

With Turbo Jam, I lost 55
pounds.
I went from a size 40 to a 33.
And it's amazing.
>> female announcer: And when it
comes to abs, moms have it the
hardest.
But Turbo Jam is so effective,
it even helps moms get rid of
that post pregnancy pooch, proof
that anyone can get great abs
with Turbo Jam.
>> I've transformed head to toe.
With Turbo Jam, I've lost 62
pounds.
I've gone from a 22 to a size 7.
And it's amazing.
I've had two C-sections.
And they say, you know,
especially after the surgery,
it's really hard to get it back.
But the moves that they do--
You're not laying there on the
floor, doing abs for an hour.
You're moving around, having
fun.
And just every time you lift
your knee, every time you go
like this, you're getting your
whole core.
And I know I'm never gonna get
heavy again, just because I love
Turbo Jam.
I'm burning calories and having
fun.

And I'm 38 years old.
Every single time I have a baby,
I go back to Turbo Jam.
It's the only thing that gets me
back into shape.
I wouldn't do anything else.
>> Since starting Turbo Jam, I
lost 71 pounds.
I went from a size 20 to a size
8.
You don't have to sit on the
floor and crunch, you know,
1,000 abs a day.
You don't.
Because you're engaging your
core in every single move that
you're doing.
After having two babies and
doing this workout, this is what
it has done to my abs.
And my husband is more than
happy.
Cannot get him off me!
I can't!

had to put the Turbo Slim plan
to the test.
And the results we saw were
astonishing.
In 10 days on the Turbo Slim
program, I lost 11 3/4 inches.
I could see huge differences in
my waist and my hips.
My abdominals are unbelievable.
Abs I've never had before.
>> In 10 days, I lost an inch

overall.

1/2 inches.
>> In 10 days, I've lost over 7
inches and 10 pounds doing Turbo
Jam.
My husband even thought, "Oh,
come on."
And he can't believe it.
I mean, he's like, "Well go
try on that bikini now."
You can do it in 10 days.
>> male announcer: Incredible
results in just 10 days or your
money back.
This is an exclusive TV offer.
You must call while there's
still time to save one full
payment and get the free upgrade
to express delivery.
So call the toll free number
now.
>> female announcer: Thousands
of people around the world have
already discovered the weight
loss and body shaping secret of
Turbo Jam.
The key is turbo training.
With turbo training, you're
working your upper body, lower
body, and your abs all at the
same time, which is why you burn
so many calories.
In fact, you can burn up to a
staggering 1,000 calories an
hour.
Best of all, it's so much fun,
you forget you're working out.
So this time, you can stick with
your workout and get lasting
results.
What makes it both fun and
incredibly effective at burning
off fat is Chalene and her Elite
11 moves.
>> This move is called the
capoeira step.
Capoeira is a form of Brazilian
martial arts that's really hot
right now in the health clubs.
It's just like you're grabbing
an imaginary opponent and
throwing him off to the side.
So not only are you gonna burn
calories, but you're gonna burn
up some stress at the same time.
She's working the legs and
tightening and toning her abs.
You're gonna see the inches come
off your waistline like never
before.
The other exercise which we
borrowed from capoeira is called
the wheel.
Legs are in that low squatting
position.
And once you're ready and you've
got the strength, we can move
on to those advanced layers
where we go a little bit deeper
into the legs, really engage the
obliques.
You can see those abs working.
The inner thigh, the outer
thigh, the glutes.
It's a total body exercise.
You will get rid of your love
handles once and for all.
It's so exciting to see that
sparkle in people's eyes when
they go, "I'm in the best shape
of my life."
>> For the first time in my
life, I was referred to as the
"skinny girl".
Since beginning Turbo Jam, I've
lost 45 pounds, gone from a size
12 to a size 4 easily.
Turbo Jam got rid of my post
pregnancy stomach.
I now have a very lean stomach
that you can see my abdominals.
But in addition to that, my
waist is smaller.
My hips are smaller.
My arms look better, they're
more shapely.
I'm just much leaner overall.
Turbo Jam works.
I would recommend it to anyone
and everyone.
>> A friend of mine who started
the program just six months
ago--
She called and left a message on
my answering machine this week.
And she said, "This is a silly
message, but my pants are
falling down.
And I'm so happy.
And I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm so excited that my pants are
falling down today."
And so for me to, you know, to
give that joy to a friend, you
know, to a close friend who had
never tried my workout before,
and to see that it could give
her that same joy was--was
really rewarding.
>> 30 years I waited to wear a
bikini.
Turbo Jam gave me that feeling
of, you know what?
Look at this.
And I put on a bikini.
I lived the first half of my
life round.
I started moving, I started
punching.
And then I started noticing the
results.
I lost 60 pounds.
It's amazing.
Now I'm long.
Now I'm lean.
Now I have a tricep.
Now I've got obliques.
Now my legs are powerful and
sexy.
And I can see the muscles in my
legs.
Turbo Jam gave me this
opportunity.
And I want other people to feel
this.
>> You've seen how Turbo Jam has
helped the people in this show.
How they've changed their lives,
not with another fad or a
gimmick, but with a proven
program that delivers real
results.
A program they love so much,
they're still doing it years
later.
Now it's your turn.
In fact, I am so sure that
you're gonna love my program,
you can try it risk-free, 30
days.
And if you don't see amazing
results, I want you to send it
back.
We'll refund your money.
But I know after one workout,
you're gonna be hooked.
So what are you waiting for?
Pick up the phone and call.
I promise it'll change your
life.

>> Announcer: THE FOLLOWING
PROGRAM IS A PAID ADVERTISEMENT
FOR ALCiS, THE SCIENCE
OF RELIEF.
ARE YOU MISSING OUT ON THE
SIMPLE PLEASURES IN LIFE?
ARE YOU UNABLE TO LIVE
AN ACTIVE, HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
BECAUSE YOUR JOINTS ARE SORE
AND HURT?
DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE JUST NOT
LIVING EACH DAY WITH PASSION AND
VIGOR BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT FEELING
YOUR BEST?
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DISCOVER
A NONINVASIVE, NONPRESCRIPTION,
DOCTOR-RECOMMENDED MEDICAL
BREAKTHROUGH THAT COULD
LITERALLY CHANGE HOW YOU MANAGE
YOUR PAIN AND ALLOW YOU TO LIVE
THE LIFE YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.
IF YOUR LIFE IS HELD BACK BY
ARTHRITIS, IF YOU ARE INHIBITED
FROM LIVING YOUR LIFE FULLY
BECAUSE OF BACK PAIN, SHOULDER
PAIN, IF YOU SUFFER FROM
FIBROMYALGIA OR ANY OTHER
CHRONIC PAIN, YOU NEED TO
STAY TUNED.
IF YOU'VE JUST PULLED A MUSCLE
AND WANT IMMEDIATE RELIEF,
YOU NEED TO STAY TUNED.
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BEING
HELD BACK, EVEN IF IT'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT, FROM LIVING YOUR
LIFE FULLY BECAUSE YOU ARE
IN PAIN, OR IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
ARE UNABLE TO DO ALL THE THINGS
YOU USED TO DO BECAUSE OF
THE ACHES, PAINS AND STIFFNESS
WE OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH GETTING
OLDER, YOU NEED TO STAY TUNED.
IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL
MEDICATIONS AND DON'T WANT TO
RELY ON TAKING POTENTIALLY TOXIC
PILLS, DON'T GO AWAY, BECAUSE
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DISCOVER
A PATENTED SOLUTION THAT IS SO
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED AND
REVOLUTIONARY THAT DOCTORS, PAIN
SPECIALISTS, RHEUMATOLOGISTS AND
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY ARE NOW RECOMMENDING IT
TO THEIR PATIENTS
WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION.
IT'S CALLED ALCiS, AND IT IS THE
TRUE SCIENCE OF PAIN RELIEF.
ALCiS IS QUICKLY BECOMING
THE PREFERRED PAIN SOLUTION FOR
PAIN SPECIALISTS AND MEDICAL
DOCTORS EVERYWHERE.
WITH ALCiS, PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO
BE MORE ACTIVE AND LIVE
THE LIVES THEY WANT, PAIN-FREE
AND FULFILLED.
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ACTIVITIES--
WALKING, BIKING, GOLF, GARDENING
OR JUST WORKING AROUND THE
HOUSE-- ALCiS CAN ALLOW YOU TO
ENJOY YOUR ACTIVITIES
TO THE FULLEST.
YOU'VE SEEN IT IN MAGAZINES
LIKE ARTHRITIS TODAY,
FIBROMYALGIA AWARE, U.S. NEWS &
WORLD REPORT AND US WEEKLY.
>> IF I AM IN PAIN, I'M
A PAIN TO BE WITH.
>> THAT KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
CONSTANT, NEVER-ENDING,
GRINDING PAIN.
>> AND IT KIND OF SHOOTS UP AND
DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BACK.
>> MY BACK, MY NECK AND MY LEGS.
>> MY HANDS AND MY NECK AND MY
LOWER BACK.
>> I'M NOT FUN TO BE AROUND
WHEN I'M IN PAIN-- I GET
A LITTLE IRRITABLE.
>> THAT'S WHY ALCiS IS SO GOOD,
BECAUSE IT STOPS IT NOW.
>> IT'S AN AMAZING PRODUCT
THAT WORKS.
>> IT'S GIVEN ME BACK
MY ATTITUDE.
>> I'M HAPPIER, BECAUSE I'M NOT
HURTING AS MUCH.
>> HELLO... LET'S TALK
ABOUT PAIN.
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU
WOKE UP THIS MORNING?
DO YOU HURT ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW?
YOUR BACK? YOUR HANDS?
YOUR KNEES?
IS PAIN AFFECTING THE WAY YOU
LIVE YOUR LIFE?
THE TRUTH IS, MOST OF US HAVE
SOME KIND OF ACHE OR PAIN EVERY
SINGLE DAY...
STRAINS AND BRUISES FROM
INJURIES, ACHING MUSCLES FROM...
JUST LIVING.
OR WHAT ABOUT JOINT PAIN
FROM ARTHRITIS?
WELL, TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT HOW TO END YOUR PAIN,
STARTING WITH A SIMPLE
PHONE CALL.
I'M VERY EXCITED TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO ALCiS DAILY RELIEF.
IT'S A WHOLE NEW WAY TO CONTROL
AND EVEN ELIMINATE YOUR PAIN.
IT'S SIMPLE TO USE, IT'S SAFE,
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.
IN FACT, ALCiS IS UNLIKE
ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER TRIED.
ALCiS IS THE SCIENCE OF RELIEF.
SO WHAT IS ALCiS?
IT'S NOT AN ORAL MEDICATION THAT
AFFECTS YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM AND
CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF
SIDE EFFECTS.
ALCiS TARGETS YOUR PAIN THROUGH
YOUR SKIN, SO IT'S SAFE TO USE.
BUT ALCiS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE
OINTMENTS THAT JUST HEAT UP THE
TOP LAYER OF YOUR SKIN, STING
YOUR EYES AND SMELL HORRIBLE.
>> THOSE WHO HAVEN'T TRIED
ALCiS, I WOULD SAY, YOU NEED TO
GIVE IT A SHOT.
>> TRY IT, I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO LOSE, RIGHT?
YOU PUT IT ON, THE PAIN
GOES AWAY.
>> IT WORKS FAST AND IT'S...
STRONG.
>> JUST TRY IT.
>> NOW LET'S LEARN MORE ABOUT
THE AMAZING TECHNOLOGY BEHIND
ALCiS FROM ITS INVENTOR,
DR. BRIAN KELLER.
DR. KELLER HOLDS A Ph.D. IN
PHARMACOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO,
WHERE HE WAS ALSO A PROFESSOR.
HE HAS SPENT HIS CAREER
DEVELOPING REVOLUTIONARY NEW
SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM
OF PAIN.
>> THE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS ARE
REALLY IN DELIVERY SYSTEMS,
GETTING THE DRUG TO THE SITE OF
ACTION, AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF ALCiS.
WE'RE TARGETING PAIN FROM
A TOPICAL PERSPECTIVE RATHER
THAN AN ORAL INTERVENTION
BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S SAFER,
WE THINK IT'S MORE DIRECT
AT THE SITE OF ACTION, AND WE
GET FASTER RESULTS.
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR
CLINICAL TRIALS IS THAT PEOPLE
GET RELIEF IN AS SOON AS
FIVE MINUTES.
THE ONSET IS QUICK, AND THEN IT
CAN LAST UP TO SIX HOURS.
MOST OF THE CREAMS THAT ARE
ON THE MARKET, THAT DON'T SMELL
GOOD, THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
LIKE TO USE, CONTAIN WHAT ARE
CALLED COUNTERIRRITANTS.
THESE ARE IRRITATING, JUST AS
THEIR TITLE SAYS.
THEY'RE IRRITATING THE SKIN AND
THEY CONFUSE THE PERCEPTION OF
PAIN WITHOUT ACTUALLY
ELIMINATING THE PAIN.
ALCiS DOESN'T BURN, IT DOESN'T
CONFUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, IT
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE PAIN AND
STARTS TO WORK.
>> Host: NOW LET'S MEET DOUG.
WHEN HIS DOCTOR TOLD HIM TO SLOW
DOWN, DOUG HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE,
AND THAT'S WHERE ALCiS CAME IN.
>> Doug: I WAS PLAYING
COMPETITIVE BASKETBALL WITH SOME
GUYS I PLAY WITH EVERY SATURDAY
MORNING, AND I TOOK A CHARGE,
AND I ENDED UP RIGHT ON
MY TAILBONE.
I WENT TO A GOOD SPORTS DOC AND
HE SAID THERE WERE THREE
ALTERNATIVES: YOU CAN TAKE
A PRESCRIPTION PAINKILLER;
YOU CAN INJECT IT WITH
CORTISONE, WHICH IS A STEROID;
OR YOU CAN HAVE IT
OPERATED ON...
AND OPTION TWO AND THREE DIDN'T
WORK FOR ME, SO I TOOK
THE PAINKILLER.
I DID GET SOME RELIEF FROM THAT.
PAINKILLERS IN GENERAL DON'T
AGREE WITH MY STOMACH,
AND I STARTED USING
ALCiS ON MY LOWER BACK.
USING ALCiS JUST MADE A LOT OF
SENSE TO ME BECAUSE IT'S
A TOPICAL PAIN RELIEVER.
AND THESE OTHERS ARE SYSTEMIC,
SO IF YOUR BACK HURTS AND YOU
TAKE ONE OF THE PAINKILLERS,
YOU GET AS MUCH IN YOUR ANKLE
AS YOU DO IN YOUR BACK.
AND I FIND OUT THAT BY BEING
ACTIVE IN SPORTS, IT REALLY DOES
BALANCE MY LIFE.
BUT YOU CAN'T PARTICIPATE
AGGRESSIVELY IN A PHYSICAL
ACTIVITY IF YOU HURT.
ALCiS TAKES AWAY THE PAIN,
AND IT WILL NOT DISTURB THE REST
OF YOUR SYSTEM.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY
REVOLUTIONARY.
>> DOUG... WHAT AN AMAZING
61-YEAR-OLD.
WHAT A STORY.
WITH HIS ACTIVE LIFESTYLE,
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT WON'T BE
HIS LAST INJURY.
BUT THANKS TO ALCiS DAILY
RELIEF, THE PAIN WON'T HOLD HIM
BACK FROM LIVING THE LIFE
HE CHOOSES.
A FEW WEEKS AGO WE GAVE ALCiS
DAILY RELIEF TO A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU WHO
SUFFER FROM ALL KINDS OF ACHES
AND PAINS.
WE ASKED THEM TO TRY IT, AND
THEN INVITED THEM BACK TO TALK
ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES.
LET'S HEAR WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.
>> I WAS INTRIGUED, BUT I WAS
A LITTLE SKEPTICAL.
>> BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IF IT
DOESN'T SMELL LIKE MEDICATED,
IT SHOULDN'T WORK.
>> I WAS SKEPTICAL, BECAUSE I'VE
TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
AND THEY'VE NEVER WORKED.
>> BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THE PAIN STOPS.
>> I WAS AMAZED AT HOW QUICKLY
IT WORKED.
>> PUT THE ALCiS CREAM ON,
AND WITHIN ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
NO MORE PAIN.
>> ALCiS IS MY NEW BEST FRIEND.
>> ORDINARY PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
ARE EXCITED ABOUT ALCiS DAILY
RELIEF, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
MEDICAL COMMUNITY?
LET'S MEET DR. JOHN MASSEY.
HE'S A GRADUATE OF STANFORD
UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,
HE'S BOARD CERTIFIED IN BOTH
PAIN MANAGEMENT AND
ANESTHESIOLOGY, AND HE'S
A PARTNER IN THE BAY AREA
PAIN CENTER.
THE CENTER CURRENTLY HAS 10,000
ACTIVE PATIENTS.
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A MAN WHO
KNOWS ABOUT TREATING PAIN.
...DR. MASSEY, WHY IS ALCiS SUCH
AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH FOR
PEOPLE WITH PAIN?
>> IN MY OPINION, ALCiS IS A
SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH
IN THAT IT PROVIDES PAIN
MEDICINES IN A WAY THAT IS
BRAND-NEW, IS TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED, IS EASY TO TAKE, AND
ACTUALLY IS QUITE SAFE.
IN MY OPINION, IT'S GOING TO BE
A VERY BIG DEAL.
YOU HAVE A LIPOSOMAL DELIVERY
SYSTEM THAT CAN ACTUALLY TAKE
PAIN MEDICINES DEEP INTO THE
SKIN, THAT GIVE IT EFFECTIVENESS
THAT PREVIOUSLY WASN'T SEEN
WITH TOPICAL MEDICATIONS,
THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY
TOXICITIES, DOESN'T HAVE ANY
INTERACTIONS WITH ANY OTHER
MEDICATIONS THAT MY
PATIENTS TAKE.
>> NOW THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT
ALCiS, IT'S TIME TO LET IT
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
WE'RE ABOUT TO TELL YOU HOW TO
ORDER, BUT FIRST, IF YOU KNOW
SOMEONE WHO HAS PAIN FROM
A PHYSICALLY DEMANDING JOB,
INVITE THEM TO JOIN US FOR
LARS' STORY, COMING RIGHT UP.
>> Announcer: ARE YOU IN PAIN
AND YOUR LIFE IS BEING HELD BACK
BECAUSE OF ARTHRITIS?
ARE YOU NOT LIVING A COMPLETE
LIFE BECAUSE OF BACK OR
SHOULDER PAIN?
PERHAPS YOU HAVE FIBROMYALGIA,
WITH ITS CHRONIC PAIN
CONTROLLING YOUR LIFE.
OR MAYBE YOU'VE JUST PULLED
A MUSCLE AND NEED SOME RELIEF.
NO MATTER HOW MINOR OR SEVERE,

>> IF THERE WERE A MEDICINE
LIKE ALCiS THAT WAS SAFE, THAT
WAS NONTOXIC, THAT WAS
EFFECTIVE, THAT WAS IN A PRODUCT
THAT YOU WOULD LIKELY USE
EVERY DAY ANYWAY...
WHY WOULDN'T YOU TRY IT?
>> OH, I'D SAY DEFINITELY
TRY IT.
YOU KNOW, PUT IT ON, TRY IT,
GIVE IT 15, 20 MINUTES, SEE IF
THAT PAIN GOES AWAY.
>> AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO
LOSE, BUT PAIN?
>> ALCiS REALLY WORKS.
>> ONCE YOU TRY IT, YOU'LL BE
HOOKED ON IT.
>> HERE'S SOMETHING TO THINK
ABOUT: IF YOU ALREADY HAD YOUR
ALCiS DAILY RELIEF AND YOU'D
SMOOTHED IT ON TO WHERE YOU WERE
HURTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS
PROGRAM, YOU'D BE FEELING
BETTER ALREADY.
ALCiS GOES TO WORK IN AS LITTLE
AS FIVE MINUTES, AND THE
SOOTHING RELIEF LASTS FOR HOURS.
...DR. MASSEY, EXACTLY WHAT
TYPES OF PAIN CAN BE HELPED BY
ALCiS DAILY RELIEF?
>> IT CERTAINLY IS A GREAT
TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE
PAIN THAT WON'T GO AWAY, PAIN
THAT PERSISTS EVERY DAY.
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR
PATIENTS WHO SUFFER
FROM ARTHRITIS?
>> I HAVE LOADS OF PATIENTS THAT
HAVE ARTHRITIS.
AND MOST COMMONLY, I SEE
A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO COMPLAIN
OF HAND PAIN.
THE ELDERLY POPULATION PUTS
CREAM ON THEIR HANDS, I WILL
TELL YOU, EVERY DAY.
IMAGINE IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY
HAVE THEM DELIVER THEIR
MEDICATIONS FOR PAIN THE SAME
WAY, AT THE SAME TIME.
IT'S SEAMLESS.
>> PAIN CAN KEEP US ALL FROM
DOING WHAT WE WANT TO DO, AND
SOMETIMES IT CAN EVEN STOP US
FROM DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
LARS SIMPLY COULDN'T AFFORD TO
LET THAT HAPPEN, SO FOR HIM,
ALCiS IS HOPE.
HERE'S HIS STORY.
>> I'M LARS ANDREWS.
I AM A MOUNTAIN GUIDE,
INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED
MOUNTAIN GUIDE.
...I HELI-SKI AND SKI TOUR
AND CLIMB.
THAT'S MY OCCUPATION.
...ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, I HAD
A FALL AND SLID DOWN
A MOUNTAINSIDE, BASICALLY,
AND TORE MY... DESTROYED MY
RIGHT KNEE.
AND TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE
PAIN THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE ACCIDENT AND THE SUBSEQUENT
SURGERY, I WAS TAKING 12, 13
PILLS A DAY.
THIS PAST SUMMER, WE'D GONE UP
THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN I TURNED
AROUND AT THE END OF THE DAY TO
DESCEND, I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
OVERCOME BY PAIN IN MY KNEE.
AT THAT POINT I REALIZED THERE
WAS NO... THERE WAS NO POINT IN
ME EVEN TRYING TO CONTINUE ON
GUIDING THAT SUMMER, IF AT ALL.
MY FIRST EXPEDITION
AFTER I STARTED USING ALCiS WAS
A PRETTY GNARLY EXPEDITION, AND
IT WAS EXTREMELY PHYSICAL AND
EXTREMELY HARD ON MY KNEES.
I USED IT EVERY DAY
ON THAT TRIP.
IT WORKED GREAT, I WAS PAIN-FREE
EVERY DAY, AND THEN I USED IT
FROM THEN ON, YEAH.
ALCiS IS SIMPLE.
IT'S JUST, YOU PUT IT ON IN THE
MORNING, IT'S JUST PART OF THAT
RITUAL, YOU KNOW?
I PUT MY SUNSCREEN ON MY FACE
AND PUT ALCiS ON MY KNEE, AND
THEN AWAY I GO.
ALCiS GIVES ME MY LIFE BACK.
>> NO MATTER WHAT YOUR JOB IS,
IF YOU HAVE PAIN, IT'S MAKING
YOUR WORK HARDER THAN IT
HAS TO BE.
SO WHY NOT TRY ALCiS AND CHANGE
THE WAY YOU FEEL?
NOW LET'S GO BACK TO
DR. BRIAN KELLER, WHO HOLDS
A Ph.D. IN PHARMACOLOGY FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
AT SAN FRANCISCO AND IS THE
INVENTOR OF THIS EXCITING
TECHNOLOGY.
>> THE ALCiS CREAM IS A WHOLE
NEW APPROACH TO STOPPING PAIN,
BY TAKING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT,
ENHANCING ITS PERMEATION INTO
LOWER LAYERS OF THE SKIN AND
DIRECTLY STOPPING THE PAIN.
THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM IS BASED ON
THE ABILITY OF THIS MICROSCOPIC
ENVELOPE THAT ENCAPSULATES THE
ACTIVE INGREDIENT AND THEN TAKES
IT DOWN INTO LOWER LAYERS OF THE
SKIN TO BETTER RELIEVE PAIN.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ON THE
MARKET LIKE THIS.
THIS IS A REVOLUTION, AND WE
ACTUALLY RECEIVED A PATENT
BECAUSE IT'S SO UNIQUE AND
SO BRAND-NEW.
>> I LOVE THE FACT THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO TAKE AN INTERNAL...
MEDICATION.
>> RIGHT NOW, ALCiS IS THE
ONLY THING THAT I'M USING.
>> IT'S A GREAT BREAKTHROUGH
BECAUSE IT WORKS SO QUICKLY.
>> FIVE TO 10 MINUTES IS
ALL IT TAKES.
>> IT LASTS FOR HOURS D HOURS.
>> PUT IT ON AND ALMOST
FORGET THAT YOU'VE DONE IT,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THINK,
"HEY, THIS FEELS BETTER."
>> IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH
ARTHRITIS, PLEASE INVITE THEM
TO JOIN YOU FOR JOYCE'S STORY,
COMING RIGHT UP.
HER PAIN WAS KEEPING HER FROM
DOING THE THINGS SHE LOVED UNTIL
ALCiS CHAND HER LIFE.
BUT RIGHT NOW, LET ALCiS CHANGE
YOUR LIFE.

>> FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST
TUNED IN, DR. JOHN MASSEY IS
A STANFORD UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
SCHOOL GRADUATE AS WELL AS
A PHYSICIAN SPECIALIZING IN
PAIN MANAGEMENT.
>> PATIENTS THAT I SEE ARE
OFTEN ON WHAT WE WOULD CALL
COCKTAILS OF MEDICATIONS.
THEY MAY BE ON THREE, FOUR,
FIVE OR EVEN SIX DIFFERENT
MEDICINES.
ALCiS IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW
TO DELIVER MEDICINES THAT REALLY
WOULDN'T AFFECT ANY OF THESE
OTHER MECHANISMS OF ACTION,
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TOXICITY, AND
WOULD LIKELY THEN ALLOW THE
PATIENTS TO TAKE LESS OF OTHER
KINDS OF MEDICATIONS THEY'RE
CURRENTLY TAKING.
>> WHAT BENEFITS DOES ALCiS
OFFER YOUR PATIENTS THAT THEY
HAVEN'T HAD BEFORE?
>> WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
NEW OR DIFFERENT MEDICINES, BUT
BY AND LARGE, THESE ARE ALL
MEDICATIONS THAT HAVE SOME
SIGNIFICANT RISKS, SOME
SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS, AND
I THINK PATIENTS ARE VERY LEERY
IN TRYING THEM.
IF I CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH
A SAFE ALTERNATIVE, LIKE ALCiS,
IT'S MY DUTY TO DO SO.
>> ALCiS IS AMAZING.
>> IT'S GIVEN ME BACK THE
ABILITY TO DO THE THINGS
THAT I LIKE TO DO.
>> ALCiS IS A WAY TO GET BACK
INTO THE GAME.
>> ALCiS IS...
FOR ME, A MIRACLE.
>> IF YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS, YOU
PROBABLY KNOW ALL ABOUT
COX-2 INHIBITORS.
THEY WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR
UNTIL GOVERNMENT REGULATORY
AGENCIES AND PHYSICIANS ALERTED
US TO THEIR SERIOUS RISK OF
HEART ATTACK AND STROKE.
>> MEDICINES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY
DID NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY
PROBLEMS ARE NOW, YOU KNOW,
BEING HAILED AS HAVING
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS.
I THINK PATIENTS ARE GONNA
BECOME MORE AND MORE WARY OF ME
GIVING THEM A DIFFERENT PILL.
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A TOPICAL
LIKE ALCiS THAT'S GONNA BE
EFFECTIVE AND THAT ISN'T GONNA
HAVE ANY DRUG INTERACTIONS
IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE.
>> SPEAKING OF THE SIDE EFFECTS
OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, LISTEN
TO THIS.
"TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE
FLUID RETENTION, KIDNEY
OR LIVER PROBLEMS.
IN RARE CASES, SERIOUS STOMACH
PROBLEMS SUCH AS G.I. BLEEDING
CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING.
THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS
IN CLINICAL TRIALS WERE
INDIGESTION, DIARRHEA, ABDOMINAL
PAIN AND VOMITING."
WITH ALCiS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.
IT'S AVAILABLE WITHOUT
A PRESCRIPTION, IT'S SAFE, IT
WON'T INTERFERE WITH ANY OTHER
TREATMENT YOU'RE USING, AND IT
WILL RELIEVE YOUR PAIN.
NOW IT'S TIME TO MEET JOYCE.
SHE HAS A DRAWER FULL OF
EXPENSIVE OINTMENTS THAT SHE
USED A FEW TIMES BUT THEN
STOPPED BECAUSE THEY WERE MORE
UNPLEASANT THAN HELPFUL.
SOUND FAMILIAR?
SHE TRIED PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING
BEFORE SHE DISCOVERED THAT, FOR
HER, ALCiS IS FREEDOM.
>> ALCiS HAS CHANGED MY
LIFE BECAUSE IT'S CHA... IT'S
MADE ME BE ABLE TO BE ME.
IT'S MADE IT... ME NOT HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT PAIN ALL THE TIME.
I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH
ARTHRITIS IN 1982, AND IT,
IT WAS PRETTY FULL-BLOWN ONSET,
SO IT CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE.
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE MADE ALL
MY CLOTHES AND MY CHILDREN'S
CLOTHES, BUT WHEN THE ARTHRITIS
GOT SO BAD I COULDN'T SEW
ANYMORE... THAT REALLY...
IT WAS LIKE A PIECE MISSING OUT
OF MY LIFE, NOT BEING ABLE
TO SEW.
WHEN YOU HURT BAD ENOUGH,
YOU'RE GONNA TRY ANYTHING.
ALCiS FEELS LIKE... IT DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE MEDICINE, IT FEELS
LIKE I'M JUST PUTTING ON THIS
VERY ELEGANT HAND CREAM
OR SOMETHING.
SO IT FEELS GOOD, AND THEN
IT HELPS. [LAUGHS]
IT'S ALMOST LIKE TAKING A DEEP
BREATH WHEN IT STARTS TO WORK,
AND IT'S LIKE... [EXHALES]
SIGH, BACK TO WORK.
WELL, THAT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY.
IF I COULD USE ONE WORD TO
DESCRIBE WHAT IT MEANS TO ME,
IT WOULD BE "FREEDOM."
BECAUSE OF ALCiS, I CAN
SEW AGAIN.
AND I SPEND A LOT OF MY TIME NOW
FORGETTING PAIN.
I LIKE THAT.
THEN, THEN I GET TO BE ME AGAIN.
>> ARE YOU ONE OF THE 70 MILLION
AMERICANS LIKE JOYCE WHO
HAVE ARTHRITIS?
NOW YOU CAN BECOME ONE OF THE
GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE FINALLY FOUND RELIEF
WITH ALCiS.
>> Dr. Keller: MOST OF THE
CREAMS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET
THAT DON'T SMELL GOOD,
THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
LIKE TO USE, CONTAIN WHAT ARE
CALLED COUNTERIRRITANTS.
THESE ARE IRRITATING, JUST AS
THEIR TITLE SAYS.
THEY'RE IRRITATING THE SKIN AND
THEY CONFUSE THE PERCEPTION OF
PAIN WITHOUT ACTUALLY
ELIMINATING THE PAIN.
ALCiS DOESN'T BURN, IT DOESN'T
CONFUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, IT
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE PAIN
AND STARTS TO WORK.
>> I DON'T LIKE THE HOT
EXPERIENCES, I DON'T LIKE THE
FREEZING COLD EXPERIENCES.
>> I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING,
FROM CREAMS, PATCHES,
THE LIQUID HEAT STUFF
WHERE IT FEELS LIKE YOUR SKIN'S
ABOUT TO BE, YOU KNOW,
IS ON FIRE.
BUT ALCiS... PERFECT.
>> I WAS SURPRISED 'CAUSE IT
DIDN'T SMELL MEDICATED
BUT IT ACTUALLY DID THE WORK.
>> IT HAS A FRESH, BEAUTIFUL
FRAGRANCE AND... THE BEST PART
IS IT WORKS.
>> ONCE YOU TRY IT,
YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT'S
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.
>> I MEAN, I CAN WHOLEHEARTEDLY
ENDORSE IT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT'S
BEEN... WHAT IT'S DONE FOR ME,
WHAT IT'S ENABLED ME TO DO.
>> JUST TRY IT.
MEASURE IT AND SEE IF IT
HELPS YOU.
I WOULD SURELY HOPE IT HELPS
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE IT HELPS ME.
>> I'M A VERY CONSERVATIVE
DOCTOR AND I ACTUALLY TAKE...
I THINK I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF
MY PATIENTS AND I WOULD NOT
EXPOSE THEM TO SOMETHING THAT
I PERSONALLY DIDN'T THINK WAS
SAFE, EFFECTIVE AND LIKELY TO
HELP THEM IN THE LONG RUN.
AND SO, WHEN I HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY ALCiS, IT WAS
EVERYTHING I WAS LOOKING FOR
IN A PAIN MEDICINE.
>> WELL, WE'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME.
YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS,
YOU'VE LISTENED TO LIFE-CHANGING
STORIES FROM DOUG, JOYCE AND
LARS, AND YOU'VE SEEN COUNTLESS
OTHER PEOPLE SHARING THEIR
INCREDIBLE RESULTS FROM
USING ALCiS.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO EXPERIENCE
THE END OF YOUR PAIN.
SO GRAB A PAD AND PEN IF YOU
HAVEN'T ALREADY, BECAUSE THIS IS
OUR LAST CHANCE TO GIVE YOU THE
INFORMATION YOU'LL NEED TO
ORDER ALCiS.
>> IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
CHRONIC PAIN, IF YOU HAVE
PROBLEMS WITH MUSCLE STRAINS,
ACHES, PAINS, AND YOU'RE TAKING
PILLS EVERY DAY TO MANAGE THIS,
HERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO
TAKING PILLS.
THIS ALTERNATIVE IS SAFE,
IT'S EASY TO USE, IT'S PLEASANT
TO USE, AND IT WORKS.

HI. I'M TAMMY FAYE.
WELCOME TO A VERY IMPORTANT
HALF HOUR OF YOUR LIFE.
BECAUSE THIS SHOW IS ABOUT
YOUR HEALTH AND WELLNESS.
MY GUEST IS KEVIN TRUDEA
AND HE'S THE AUTHOR OF
A BLOCKBUSTER BEST-SELLING BOOK,
"NATURAL CURES THAT THEY
DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT."
KEVIN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S A PLEASURE.
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU,
TAMMY FAYE.
NOW, KEVIN,
WHO ARE THE ELUSIVE "THEY"?
THE BOOK, "NATURAL CURES
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT,"
WHAT IT TALKS ABOUT IS THE FACT
THAT THERE ARE, IN FACT,
NATURAL NON-DRUG
AND NON-SURGICAL WAYS
TO PREVENT AND CURE
VIRTUALLY EVERY DISEASE.
AND THERE ARE
A GROUP OF COMPANIES,
PRIMARILY THE PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES, THE DRUG COMPANIES,
AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT,
THE FDA AND THE FTC,
THAT DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
THAT THERE ARE NATURAL
NON-DRUG AND NON-SURGICAL CURES
FOR VIRTUALLY ALL DISEASES.
AND THE REASON, TAMMY FAYE,
THAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW
SE IT WILL COST
THE DRUG COMPANIES MONEY.
YO NATURAL REMEDIES.
YOU CAN ONLY MAKE MONEY
ON PATENTED DRUGS,

AND THAT'S WHAT THIS CURE IS--
THAT'S WHAT THIS BOOK
IS ABOUT TO DO,
IS EXPOSING THE NATURAL CURES
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T BEING TOLD
THAT ACTUALLY DO EXIST.
IN,
YOU LOOK VERY YOUNG TO ME.
YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A GRAN OTHE 
OR SOMEONE.
GET A YOUNG MAN
THINKING ABOUT NATURAL CURES?
ACTUALLY, IN THE BOOK
I DO TELL THE STORY
HOW I HAD SOME
MAJOR MEDICAL PRAS VERY YOUNG,
WITH
A DEFORMED HEART,
A MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE,
STANDARD MEDICAL
COMMUNITY DIDN'T HAVE
THE ANSWER TO THAT PROBLEM
I HAD TO SEEK OUT
NATURAL ALTERNATIVES.
AND THE FUNNY THING
THAT I FOUND IS,
THERE WAS A NATURAL CURE
FOR MY MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE,

BUT IT WASN'T ALLOWED
IN AME 
THE FDA HAS MADE THAT ILLEGAL
IN AMERICA.
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL,
BUT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE CURE.
SHAME!
AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW.
THE FDA, THE FOOD
AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION
IN THIS COUNTRY,
PASSES THEIR OWN REGULATIONS,
WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL,
AND THE REGULATION
THAT THE FDA PASSED SAYS,
ONLY A DRUG CAN CURE,
PREVENT OR TREAT A DISEASE.
ONLY A DRUG CAN CURE,
PREVENT OR TREAT A DISEASE.
NOW, THAT IS
ABSOLUTELY INSANE.
THE FDA IS NOT TRYING
TO GET PEOPLE WELL.
THEY'RE NOT TRYING
TO CURE PEOPLE OF DISEASE.
THE FDA IS PROTECTING THE
PROFITS OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.
A DRUG IS NOT THE ONLY THING
THAT CAN CURE, PREVENT
OR TREAT A DISEASE,
BUT IT'S THE LAW IN AMERICA.
NOW, YOU'VE HEARD
OF THE DISEASE SCURVY.
SCURVY IS
A NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCY,
IT'S A VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY.
THE CURE FOR SCURVY IS WHAT?
EAT AN ORANGE.
ORANGES!
EXACTLY.
NOW, IF I WENT ON TELEVISION
AND I LOOKED AT THE CAMERA
AND I SAID.
"I HAVE AN ORANGE HERE,
AND THIS IS THE CURE
FOR THE DISEASE OF SCURVY,"
GUESS WHAT?
I WOULD GO TO JAIL.
THEY'D SLAP YOU RIGHT DOWN.
I WOULD GO TO JAIL, 
BECAUSE I WOULD BE SELLING
A "DRUG"--
BUT I BETCHA
THEY'D GO EAT THE ORANGE!
THEY'D EAT THE ORANGE.
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
THE DRUG COMPANIES DO NOT WANT
TO CURE OR PREVENT DISEASE.
THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE
PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS,
AND ALL THEY WANT TO DO
IS SELL MORE DRUGS.
WELL,
IT'S PROFITABLE FOR EVERYONE.
BECAUSE IT'S PROFITABLE
FOR THE DRUG COMPANY,
IT'S PROFITABLE
FOR THE RESEARCHERS,
IT'S PROFITABLE
FOR THE DOCTORS.
CORRECT.
THE ONLY ONE
IT'S NOT PROFITABLE FOR
IS US THE PATIENTS.
NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE FACT THAT
MORE AND MORE THINGS
ARE BEING CALLED DISEASES--
YEARS AGO WE HAD HEARTBURN,
NOW IT'S CALLED
ACID REFLUX DISEASE.
YEARS AGO
PEOPLE USED TO BE SHY.
NOW IT'S
SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER--
A DISEASE.
IT'S NOT A DISEASE.
BUT THE REASON
THEY'RE BEING CALLED DISEASES
IS BECAUSE,
ACCORDING TO THE FDA,
ONCE SOMETHING
IS LABELED A DISEASE,
ONLY A DRUG CAN THEN CURE,
PREVENT OR TREAT IT.
AND THAT'S HOW THEY GET RID
OF NATURAL REMEDIES.
DID YOU KNOW,
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IS BEING PUT INTO "RESEARCH"
TO CURE DISEASE--
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
MONEY IS NOT
BEING PUT INTO RESEARCH
TO CURE DISEASE.
WHEN PEOPLE GIVE MONEY
TO FOUNDATIONS AND CHARITIES,
THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING USED
TO CURE DISEASE.
IT'S NOT BEING USED
TO FIND A CURE.
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.
IT'S BEING USED TO FIND
A PATENTABLE DRUG
THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES CAN EN SELL.
JUST READ
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.
READ INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY.
LISTEN TO THE REPORTS
ON TELEVISION.
PUBLICLY TRADED DRUG COMPANIES
HAVE A LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO INCREASE PROFITS
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.
IF A DRUG COMPANY'S GOAL
WAS TO CURE AND PREVENT DISEASE,
THEY'D ALL BE OUT OF BUSINESS.
OH, I BELIEVE THEY WOULD,
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
A LOT OF DISEASES
WOULD BE CURED RIGHT NOW,
IF THAT WERE THEIR GOAL.
THERE ARE CURES.
AND THAT'S THE THING.
IF A PERSON HAS
ACID REFLUX DISEASE,
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE.
IF THEY HAVE HEART DISEASE,
THEY DON'T NEED BYPASS SURGERY--
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE.
DIABETES--
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE.
MATTER OF FACT,
DIABETES IS ONE EXAMPLE.
THERE WAS A RESEARCHER
IN CANADA.
AN HERBAL COMBINATION
WAS RESEARCHED
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY
FOR OVER 25 YEARS.
IT WAS SHOWN BY
THE ASIAN DIABETIC ASSOCIATION
TO BE THE FINAL CURE
FOR DIABETES.
IT'S JUST
A COMBINATION OF HERBS--
VIRTUALLY ERADICATES
AND CURES DIABETES
IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
IN MOST CASES--
NOT ALL, BUT MOST CASES.
THE RESEARCHER
WAS OFFERED $30 MILLION CASH
TO TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET.
BECAUSE IT WOULD COST
THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES
TOO MUCH MONEY.
THE FDA IS TRYING TO BLOCK IT
FROM COMING INTO AMERICA
BECAUSE IT'LL HURT THE PROFITS
OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.
THERE'S A CURE FOR HERPES.
WE HEAR ON TELEVISION
THESE ADS THAT SAY,
"THERE IS NO CURE FOR HERPES,
TAKE OUR DRUG EVERY DAY
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE."
IT'S A COMPLETE FRAUD,
IT'S A COMPLETE LIE.
THERE'S LAWSUITS
GOING ON RIGHT NOW
AGAINST THE MANUFACTURER
FOR MANY OF THESE "HERPES DRUGS"
SHOWING THAT THEY DO NOT WORK
AS THEY'RE BEING PROMOTED.
THERE IS A NATURAL CURE.
IN MY BOOK, NOW,
"NATURAL CURE,"
I GIVE 50 SPECIFIC DISEASES
AND I TELL PEOPLE NOW
WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE
THE NATURAL CURES
OR THE WAYS TO PREVENT--
LET'S NAME SOME OF THESE.
CANCER, DIABETES,
HEART DISEASE, DEPRESSION.
YOU'VE MADE SOME REAL
STATEMENTS HERE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION.
PROZAC AND ALL
THE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF DEPRESSION TYPE OF DRUGS
BEING SOLD OUT THERE
I BELIEVE ARE ONE OF
THE GREATEST CRIMES
AGAINST HUMANITY,
IN MY OPINION.
YEAH, I THINK SO, TOO.
JUST RECENTLY
THIS KID UP IN MINNESOTA
TOOK A COUPLE OF GUNS,
KILLED ALL THESE PEOPLE?
IT WAS REPORTED THAT
HE WAS ON PROZAC,
STARTED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.
VIRTUALLY EVERY VIOLENT CRIME
COMMITTED BY A CHILD IN SCHOOL
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, WHERE
THEY GO IN AND KILL PEOPLE,
ALMOST ALL OF THOSE KIDS
WERE ON SOME TYPE OF
PSYCHIATRIC PRESCRIBED DRUG,
PRIMARILY FOR DEPRESSION
AND THINGS.
I THINK THAT IS A SIN
TO PUT YOUR CHILD ON
THINGS LIKE THAT.
THE DRUGS, IN MY OPINION,
ARE CAUSING A LOT OF
THE PROBLEMS.
NOW, THERE IS A NATURAL CURE
FOR DEPRESSION.
THERE'S A NATURAL
NON-DRUG AND NON-SURGICAL CURE
FOR DEPRESSION
WHICH RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN
CURES DEPRESSION--
GET THIS--CURES DEPRESSION,
95% OF THE CASES,
IN TWO TO THREE DAYS.
CURES.
THE DEPRESSION GOES AWAY.
IT'S A NATURAL,
NON-DRUG, NON-SURGICAL CURE.
I TELL IT IN THE BOOK.
ADDICTIONS--PEOPLE ARE
ADDICTED TO SMOKING,
CIGARETTES,
SOME PEOPLE ARE
ADDICTED TO CHOCOLATE--
ME!
I GOTTA READ THE BOOK!
WHERE'S THE BOOK?!
WHERE'D IT GO?!
THERE'S ACTUALLY A NATURAL WAY
TO REDUCE OR
ELIMINATE ADDICTIONS
AND STOP
THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGES.
FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS WITH
A PARTICULAR DOCTOR
THAT WAS BEING
INTERVIEWED ON CNN.
AND THE INTERVIEWER
WAS A CHOCOHOLIC,
AND DURING THE BREAK
THE INTERVIEWER SAID,
"YOU KNOW, DOCTOR,
I'M ADDICTED TO CHOCOLATE,
"I CARRY IT WITH ME
ALL THE TIME,
"IF I DON'T HAVE IT
I HAVE ANXIETY ATTACKS.
I NEED TO HAVE CHOCOLATE,
I CAN'T STOP EATING IT."
SOME PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR
WITH THESE UNCONTROLLABLE URGES,
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S FOR COOKIES
OR CAKE OR ICE CREAM
OR POTATO CHIPS,
AND A LOT OF IT
CAUSES WEIGHT PROBLEMS.
SO HE SAID, "THERE'S A WAY,
IN FIVE MINUTES,
"THAT WE CAN REDUCE
OR ELIMINATE
THIS ADDICTIVE,
UNCONTROLLABLE URGE."
SHE SAID, "IT WON'T WORK."
SO HE SAID, "TAKE THE CHOCOLATE
OUT OF YOUR PURSE."
SHE TOOK IT OUT.
HE SAID, "OKAY, NOW--"
"GIVE IT TO YOUR FRIEND!"
HA HA HA HA!
HE SAID, "NOW SMELL
THE CHOCOLATE,"
AND SHE SMELLED IT,
AND YOU COULD SEE THE ANXIETY,
'CAUSE SHE WANTED IT SO BAD.
AND HE SAID, "ON A SCALE
OF ONE TO TEN, WHERE'S YOUR URGE
FOR THAT CHOCOLATE?"
SHE GOES, "IT'S ABOUT A TEN."
HE SAYS, "OKAY,
LET'S DO THIS TECHNIQUE."
SO HE DID THE TECHNIQUE
AND HE SAID,
"NOW WHERE'S YOUR URGE?"
SHE LOOK AT THE CHOCOLATE
AND SAID, "I DON'T WANT IT."
ALL OF HER FACIAL MUSCLES
RELAXED, HER BREATHING CHANGED,
AND HE SAID--
WHAT PAGE IS THAT?
HE SAID, "PICK UP
THE CHOCOLATE."
HE SAID, "YOU CAN
STILL EAT THE CHOCOLATE,"
SHE GOES, "I KNOW,
BUT I DON'T HAVE
THAT UNCONTROLLABLE URGE."
AND SHE GOES,
"I DON'T WANT IT."
WHEN THEY WENT BACK ON THE AIR,
A CALLER CALLED UP
AND SAID TO THE HOST,
"DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
IN THE BREAK?"
AND SHE SAID, "WHY?"
AND THE CALLER SAID,
"BECAUSE YOU LOOK
TEN YEARS YOUNGER
THEN YOU DID
JUST FIVE MINUTES AGO."
AND THE REASON WAS,
THE PARTICULAR TECHNIQUE
THAT THIS DOCTOR DEVELOPED
REDUCES STRESS IN THE BODY
AND ALL THE FACIAL MUSCLES
RELAXED
AND HER BREATHING CHANGED,
AND SHE ACTUALLY
APPEARED TEN YEARS YOUNGER
IN JUST FIVE MINUTES.
AND THE ADDICTIVE URGE
WENT AWAY.
NOW, THAT WORKS
FOR CIGARETTE SMOKING,
IN MY OPINION,
IT WORKS FOR PEOPLE
THAT ARE ADDICTED TO ANYTHING.
I SMOKED CIGARS
FOR 20 YEARS.
TRIED TO QUIT.
TOTALLY ADDICTED
TO THE NICOTINE.
USED THIS TECHNIQUE,
AND I EXPLAIN IT IN THE BOOK,
I DISCOVERED A WAY
FOR MYSELF--
IT WORKED,
I QUIT SMOKING.
YOU PASS THAT TECHNIQUE ON
IN YOUR BOOK AND NOW IT WORKS.
IT WORKED FOR ME
AND IT ABSOLUTELY
GOT RID OF MY SMOKE,
AND I EXPLAIN THAT
IN THE BOOK.
I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE
BEEN BRAINWASHED
BY THE DRUG COMPANIES.
DO YOU THINK SO?
I THINK NOT ONLY
ARE WE BEING BRAINWASHED,
WE'RE BEING LIED TO.
YEARS AGO
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY KNEW
THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING
CAUSED DISEASE.
THEY KNEW IT IN 1950,
THEY LIED ABOUT IT,
THEY HID THE INFORMATION,
THEY LIED ABOUT IT
BEFORE CONGRESS.
IN MY OPINION,
THE DRUG COMPANIES KNOW
THAT THE DRUGS
THAT THEY'RE SELLING
ARE CAUSING DISEASE
AND ARE INEFFECTIVE.
THEY KNOW THIS,
THEY'RE HIDING THE RESEARCH.
THEY KNOW THAT
THERE ARE NATURAL CURES
FOR EVERY DISEASE.
THEY KNOW THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR HERPES,
THEY KNOW THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR DIABETES,
THEY KNOW THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR CANCER.
THEY KNOW THERE'S A NATURAL CURE
FOR DEPRESSION, FOR ACID REFLUX.
BUT THEY CAN'T MAKE MONEY
SELLING NATURAL CURES.
THEY ONLY MAKE MONEY
SELLING PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS.
CAN I INTERRUPT YOU
JUST ONCE?
YES.
IS THERE EVERY ANY TIME
WHERE SURGERY IS NECESSARY,
IN YOUR OPINION?
YES. IF I PERSON
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR 40 OR 50 YEARS
AND THEY NEED
A HIP REPLACEMENT
BECAUSE THEY'VE
PRETTY MUCH WORN IT OUT,
Y'KNOW, WE HAVE GREAT ADVANCES
IN THAT TYPE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE.
AND CERTAINLY DRUGS AND SURGERY
ARE GREAT IN CRISIS SITUATIONS.
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE,
"IF I'M IN A CAR CRASH,
"AND I'M DYING
AND MY BODY'S RIPPED OPEN
"AND I'M BLEEDING,
RUSH ME TO AN E.R.,
"HAVE A TRAINED MEDICAL DOCTOR
USE DRUGS AND SURGERY
TO SAVE MY LIFE."
BUT THE DRUGS AND SURGERY
ARE NOT GONNA PREVENT DISEASE.
NO, THEY WILL NOT.
AND YOU ARE INTO
MORE OF THE PREVENTING
OF DISEASES.
THERE ARE WAYS TO CURE IT
ONCE YOU KNOW THE NATURAL CURES.
I DO WANT TO TELL PEOPLE
HOW TO GET IT.
THIS IS THE NEW BOOK,
IT'S THE NEW VERSION,
IT'S CALLED "NATURAL CURES
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT."
NOW, THE ORIGINAL VERSION,

THE NATURAL CURES.

OR OBESITY,

MY NEWEST BOOK ON CD,
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THE TITLE,
IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN CENSORED BY
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.
OH!
THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK--
I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT
HOW THE GOVERNMENT
IS CENSORING INFORMATION--
IT'S NOT DIRTY OR ANYTHING?
NO, BUT THEY DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
IT'S THE WEIGHT LOSS SECRET
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT.
AND THE GOVERNMENT TOLD ME
THAT IF I MENTION THIS TITLE--
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TELLING ME
HOW I CAN TITLE A BOOK.
THEY SAID THEY WILL
BURN THE BOOKS.
THIS IS INCLUDED FREE.
AND I'M ALSO GONNA INCLUDE
THE LAST FEW ISSUES
OF MY NEWSLETTER.
I HAVE A MONTHLY NEWSLETTER
THAT COMES OUT.
THERE ARE VIRTUALLY HUNDREDS
OF NEW DISCOVERIES
ON NATURAL CURES
EVERY SINGLE MONTH,
AND I HAVE A NEWSLETTER
THAT COMES OUT WITH
THESE DISCOVERIES.
THERE ARE NO ADS
IN THESE NEWSLETTERS,
I DON'T SELL ANY
SUPPLEMENTS OR PRODUCTS,
IT'S ALL INFORMATION,
AND I'M GONNA INCLUDE THESE
FREE OF CHARGE.
SO WHEN YOU CALL,
YOU GET THE BOOK,
YOU GET THE WEIGHT LOSS CD,
MY NEWEST BOOK ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS
ON A CD, IT'S FREE,
PLUS THE NEWSLETTERS FREE,
AND YOU'LL ALSO GET
A SUBSCRIPTION TO MY NEWSLETTER
IF YOU WANT.
BUT YOU CAN CALL
AND GET ALL THE INFORMATION.
BUT IF YOU DO WANT THE BOOK,
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CALL
AND GET THE BOOK TO HELP
SUPPORT THIS INFORMATION.
YOU KNOW, KEVIN,
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
AND I DO NOT THINK, UNLESS
WE HAVE THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE,
THAT WE HAVE ANY WAY
THAT WE CAN DISCUSS
EVEN RATIONALLY
WITH OUR DOCTORS.
CORRECT.
SO MANY TIMES
WE WILL TELL OUR DOCTORS,
"WELL, I'M ON THIS OR THAT,
I'M TAKING THE GREEN STUFF,
I'M DRINKING THINGS,
I'M ON THE NATURAL PRODUCTS,"
AND THE DOCTOR
KIND OF GIVES YOU THIS (smirks)
KIND OF THING.
AND THAT REALLY
FRUSTRATES ME.
BUT DOCTORS ARE NOT TAUGHT 
THE NATURAL WAY AT ALL.
THEY ARE TAUGHT
IT HAS TO BE THE KNIFE
OR IT HAS TO BE DRUGS.
EXACTLY RIGHT.
DOCTORS, WHEN THEY
GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,
AND I EXPOSE THIS IN THE BOOK,
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT DOCTORS ARE NOT TAUGHT
ANYTHING, IN EFFECT,
EXCEPT HOW TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS
AND HOW TO CUT OUT
PARTS OF YOUR ANATOMY--
IT'S CALLED SURGERY.
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE TAUGHT.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES
SEND SALES REPS
INTO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
WITH FANCY PRESENTATIONS,
AND THE PRESENTATION IS,
"DOCTOR, LET ME TELL YOU HOW
"YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR INCOME
$100,000 A YEAR.
PRESCRIBE TO YOUR PATIENTS
THIS NEW DRUG."
DRUGS ARE BEING PROMOTED
EVERYWHERE.
THEY'RE ON TELEVISION--
BUT YOU DON'T NEED THEM.
FOR EXAMPLE, ACID REFLUX.
AGAIN, WE USED
TO HAVE HEARTBURN.
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE
FOR ACID REFLUX--
APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
IS ONE OF THE NATURAL CURES.
IF YOU TAKE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
AND GO TO ANY STORE AND GET
RAW APPLE CIDER VINEGAR,
AND IF YOU JUST TAKE
A FEW SPOONS BEFORE YOUR MEALS,
IT CAN ELIMINATE INSTANTLY
THE ACID REFLUX PROBLEM
YOU HAVE IN MOST CASES.
BUT NOW,
ISN'T THAT ACIDIC?
WELL, THIS IS
THE INTERESTING THING.
PEOPLE THINK THAT
WHEN YOU HAVE ACID REFLUX,
YOU HAVE TOO MUCH ACID.
NO. YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ACID.
COME ON!
THAT'S WHAT THE BIG SCAM IS.
REMEMBER YEARS AGO
THEY HAD THESE ADS ON TV
AND YOU HAD A GLASS
MODEL OF A STOMACH?
AND IT SAID, "WATCH HOW
OUR DRUG NEUTRALIZES
THE EXCESS ACID."
AND THEY SHAKE IT.
WELL, IT DIDN'T NEUTRALIZE
THE EXCESS ACID,
IT NEUTRALIZED ALL THE ACID.
THINK ABOUT IT--YOU CAN'T JUST
NEUTRALIZE SOME, IT
NEUTRALIZED IT ALL.
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS--
AND YOU HAD NO ACID!
YOUR STOMACH NEEDS ACID
TO DIGEST FOOD.
WHEN YOU TAKE THESE DRUGS,
IT NEUTRALIZES ALL THE ACID
AND THEN YOUR BODY SAYS,
"OH, MY GOD, WE NEED ACID
TO DIGEST THE FOOD,"
AND IT PUMPS MASSIVE AMOUNTS
OF ACID INTO THE STOMACH.
BECAUSE WE'RE ACID
OR ALKALINE, RIGHT?
THAT'S YOUR BODY pH.
BUT YOU NEED ACID
IN YOUR STOMACH
TO DIGEST FOOD.
SO IF YOU TAKE
RAW APPLE CIDER VINEGAR,
IN MOST CASES
THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM.
YOU COULD ALSO GET
SOME DIGESTIVE ENZYMES.
HYDROCHLORIC ACID,
A COUPLE OF OTHER
DIGESTIVE ENZYMES YOU CAN TAKE
THAT COULD SOLVE
THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM.
DEPRESSION--AGAIN,
I MENTIONED THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR DEPRESSION.
ARTHRITIS. YOU CAN GO
ON THE INTERNET--
NOW, BY THE WAY,
I DON'T SELL ANY VITAMINS,
MINERALS, HERBS,
OR ANY SUPPLEMENTS.
I'M A COMPLETE
CONSUMER ADVOCATE.
I'M THE ONLY GUY--
GARY NOLL'S A GREAT GUY,
DEEPAK CHOPRA'S A GREAT GUY,
DR. WHITAKER'S A GREAT GUY,
AND THEY CONCUR
WITH WHAT I SAY
AND I CONCUR GENERALLY
WITH WHAT THEY SAY.
BUT THEY ALL SELL
SUPPLEMENTS,
THEY ALL SELL
VITAMINS AND MINERALS.
WHICH IS OKAY.
BUT WHEN I MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION,
I HAVE NO FINANCIAL
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
I'M NOT GETTING ANY MONEY
FROM ANY SUPPLEMENT COMPANY,
I DON'T SELL ANYTHING.
SO IF I TELL SOMEBODY
TO BUY SOMETHING,
I HAVE NO FINANCIAL
INTEREST WHATSOEVER.
TO ME, THAT MAKES YOU
VERY CREDIBLE.
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT
I'M GIVING YOU
MY HONEST OPINION.
HONEST OPINION, YES.
YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S AN HONEST OPINION.
SO CETYL MYRISTOLEATE,
IF A PERSON HAS ARTHRITIS--
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS WRITE DOWN THE INITIAL "CMO,"
GO ON THE INTERNET,
YOU CAN FIND IT,
IT VIRTUALLY IS
A CURE FOR ARTHRITIS.
MY.
VIRTUALLY A CURE
FOR ARTHRITIS.
I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE AGAIN
ABOUT THE BOOK AND THE OFFER.
YOU CAN BUY THE BOOK
ALMOST EVERYWHERE NOW.
THIS NEW EDITION HAS
OVER 200 ADDITIONAL PAGES,
50 SPECIFIC DISEASES
ARE LISTED,
WITH WHAT I BELIEVE
TO BE THE NATURAL CURES.
JUST $14.95.
BUT IF YOU CALL
ON TELEVISION NOW
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET THE BOOK,
AND WE DO HAVE RUSH SHIPPING
AND OVERNIGHT SHIPPING
AVAILABLE,
BUT I'M ALSO GONNA INCLUDE
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO
WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT
MY NEWEST BOOK ON CD,
WHICH HAS BEEN CENSORED
BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE CENSORING IN
JUST A MINUTE, TOO.
IT'S CALLED
"THE WEIGHT LOSS SECRET
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW."
THERE'S ANOTHER TITLE HERE,
BUT THE FTC SAID
IF I MENTION THE TITLE
THAT THEY'LL PROSECUTE ME
AND THEY'LL BURN THESE.
NOW, WE LIVE IN AMERICA,
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FREE SPEECH.
YES.
THERE IS NO FREE SPEECH.
I KNOW THAT.
SO IT'S FREE WHEN YOU CALL.
AND I'LL ALSO SEND YOU
A FEW OF MY LAST ISSUES
OF MY NEWSLETTER FREE OF CHARGE.
AND YOU ALSO GET A SUBSCRIPTION
TO MY NEWSLETTER.
ONE TALKS ABOUT
CHOLESTEROL THERE.
AND HERE IS CANCER
PREVENTED AND CURED.
I JUST HAD CANCER.
AND NEVER HAVE A HEART ATTACK,
NEVER HAVE CLOGGED ARTERIES.
THIS IS STUFF
YOU NEED TO KNOW, PEOPLE!
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT CANCER
FOR A SECOND.
I'LL JUST READ THIS
RIGHT OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER HERE.
IT SAYS, "AS UNBELIEVABLE
AS IT SEEMS,
"THE KEY TO STOPPING
MANY CANCERS
"HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
"IT WAS A DOCTOR
THAT DISCOVERED A SERUM
THAT VIRTUALLY MADE CANCER
TUMORS VANISH IN 90 MINUTES."
IN 90 MINUTES.
90 MINUTES.
IT WAS DONE
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
THE DOCTOR WAS
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN
BY THE FDA
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
PATENT THE SERUM
AND NO DRUG COMPANY
COULD MAKE MONEY ON IT.
DR. BUDWIG DISCOVERED
THAT ALL CANCERS
HAD NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES,
SPECIFIC NUTRIENTS IN THE BLOOD
WERE NOT THERE.
AND WHEN THOSE
NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES
WERE ADDRESSED,
ALL THE CANCERS VANISHED.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
THE FDA DOES NOT WANT
NATURAL REMEDIES OUT THERE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION
APPROVES DRUGS, OKAY?
THEY HAVE COMMITTEES
THAT REVIEW THE RESEARCH--
THAT'S BEEN PAID FOR
BY THE DRUG COMPANIES,
ALL THE RESEARCH
IS PAID FOR BY
THE DRUG COMPANIES--
AND THESE COMMITTEES
REVIEW IT,
AND THEN THEY SAY,
"YES, THIS DRUG IS
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE."
NOW, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT THE MAJORITY OF MEMBERS
OF THESE COMMITTEES
ARE ON THE PAYROLL
OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.
YEAH, SO THEY BETTER AGREE!
THAT'S CALLED
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST!
THE MAJORITY
OF FDA COMMISSIONERS,
WHEN THEY LEFT THE FDA,
GO TO WORK DIRECTLY FOR
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.
NOW, IN ANY OTHER WORLD,
THAT WOULD BE CALLED A PAYOFF,
A FLAGRANT BRIBE.
YOU'D GET PUT IN JAIL FOR IT!
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
WHY THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING
TO SUPPRESS THIS INFORMATION.
THIS WAS REPORTED ON FOX NEWS:
CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS TODAY
ARE ALLOWED TO, IN EFFECT,
BUY AND SELL STOCK
ON INSIDER INFORMATION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS.
ONE CONGRESSWOMAN
FROM CALIFORNIA MADE,
IT WAS REPORTED,
$10 MILLION
BUYING AND SELLING STOCK
ON INSIDER--
INFORMATION THAT YOU AND I
DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS
TO WHAT IS GONNA BE VOTED ON
IN THE COMMITTEES
IN CONGRESS.
AND THEY MADE A LAW
THAT MADE THEMSELF EXEMPT
FROM PROSECUTION.
IF ANYONE ELSE DID THIS,
WE'LL ALL TO GO JAIL.
WE'D BE LOOKING AT
THE WORLD LIKE THIS.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO THINK ABOUT IT--
IF YOU'RE A CONGRESSMAN
AND A SENATOR
AND YOU KNOW WHAT DRUGS
ARE GONNA BE APPROVED,
WHAT DRUGS MEDICARE
IS GONNA START BUYING,
WHAT DRUGS ARE GONNA BE
SHIPPED OVERSEAS AS PART
OF THESE AIDS PACKAGES,
YOU CAN BUY AND SELL STOCK
IN THOSE DRUG COMPANIES
AND MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
AND IT'S BEING DONE
ALL THE TIME.
AND PEOPLE AREN'T BEING
EXPOSED TO THE TRUTH.
THERE'S CORRUPTION
AT ALL LEVELS.
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
TOLD ME
THAT IF I PUT
CERTAIN THINGS IN THIS BOOK
THEY WOULD SAY,
"IF YOU'RE GONNA
SELL THIS BOOK ON TV,
"LEMME TELL YOU,
YOU CAN'T SAY THIS
IN THE BOOK,
"YOU CAN'T PUT THIS
IN THE BOOK,
"YOU CAN'T PUT THAT IN THE BOOK,
AND IF YOU DO
PUT THAT IN THE BOOK"--
THIS IS A BOOK, FOLKS,
THIS IS AMERICA,
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
FREE SPEECH.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO WRITE WHATEVER I WANT.
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
SAID IF I WANNA SELL THIS BOOK
ON TELEVISION,
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
I CANNOT PUT IN THIS BOOK,
AND IF I DID,
THEY WOULD, IN EFFECT,
PROSECUTE ME
AND THEY WOULD, IN EFFECT,
TAKE THESE BOOKS
AND BURN THE BOOKS.
IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA?!
IT SOUNDS LIKE NAZI GERMANY,
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE GESTAPO.
THE FOOD AND DRUG
ADMINISTRATION
REPEATEDLY GOES INTO PEOPLE THAT
ARE SELLING NATURAL PRODUCTS
WITH ARMED AGENTS,
GUNS DRAWN.
THEY CAME INTO MY OFFICE.
I SOLD CALCIUM.
WE TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW
NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING AUTHORS
SAID THAT CANCER CAN'T LIVE IN
AN OXYGEN-RICH ENVIRONME,
AND CALCIUM IS
A NEEDED NUTRIENT IN THE BODY--
THE TRUTHFUL STATEMENT.
FDA SAID WE MADE
A DISEASE CLAIM,
THE CALCIUM
IS NO LONGER CALCIUM,
IT'S NOW A DRUG,
THEY CAME IN--GUNS DRAWN!--
TO SEIZE THE CALCIUM.
WHEN DID CALCIUM
BECOME A DRUG?
THIS HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME IN AMECA,
AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THE SUPPRESSION THAT'S GOING ON
BY THE FDA AND THE FTC.
THINK ABOUT IT.
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US
FROM MONOPOLIES.
THEY'RE NOT--
THEY'RE PROTECTING
THE MONOPOLIES!
THEY'RE PROTECTING
THE MONOPOLIES' PROFITS
AT THE EXPENSE OF--
MILLIONS OF LIVES.
AT THE EXPENSE OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DYING
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
AND CAN'T GET AHOLD OF THESE.
I BELIEVE THAT 100%.
YOU TALK ABOUT
CHIROPRACTORS IN HERE,
YOU TALK ABOUT SO MANY
OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS
THAT THE HERBALISTS
CAN DO FOR YOU AND EVERYTHING,
THERE IS SO MUCH INFORMATION
IN THIS BOOK!
I THANK GOD
I READ THIS BOOK.
I AM JUST OFF CHEMOTHERAPY,
AND I AM STILL
SUFFERING THE EFFECTS
OF CHEMOTHERAPY--
VERY NUMB HANDS,
MY TONGUE IS VERY NUMB,
GETTING TERRIBLE BACKACHES--
SO MANY THINGS
ARE HAPPENING TO ME
AS A RESULT--
OF THE CHEMO.
I'VE HAD THREE GIRLFRIENDS DIE,
NOT OF CANCER,
THEY DIED AS A RESULT
OF THE CHEMOTHERAPY.
THE TREATMENTS,
EXACTLY.
I GET THOUSANDS OF LETTERS
EVERY WEEK FROM PEOPLE
WHO GOT THE BOOK
AND ARE APPLYING
THE TECHNIQUES IN THE BOOK,
AND THEY'RE SAYING--
ONE EXAMPLE:
A WOMAN THAT I MET
IN ARIZONA.
SHE HAD A CANE, AND SHE SAID,
"I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.
IS THERE A NATURAL CURE?"
I SAID, "FIRST OFF,
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
"I'M NOT PRESCRIBING.
"GO SEE A LICENSED
HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER
"WHO DOESN'T USE
DRUGS AND SURGERY,
BUT LET ME GIVE YOU
A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS."
I SAID, "MOST M.S. SYMPTOMS
ARE CAUSED BY A FOOD ADDITIVE,
"SOMETHING THAT YOU EAT,
"THAT THE FOOD COMPANIES
ARE PUTTING IN THE FOOD.
"IF YOU ELIMINATE IT,
YOUR M.S. SYMPTOMS
WOULD PROBABLY GO AWAY.
PLUS IT'S CAUSED
BY HEAVY METAL TOXICITY.
OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH."
LOADED WITH DENTAL WORK.
I SAID, "IF YOU GET RID
OF THE DENTAL WORK
"AND STOP EATING
THIS FOOD ADDITIVE,
YOUR SYMPTOMS SHOULD VANISH."
SHE SAID, "I'LL TRY IT."
THREE MONTHS LATER
SHE CALLED ME,
SHE SAID ALL...
ALL OF HER M.S. SYMPTOMS
HAVE MIRACULOUSLY VANISHED.
SHE WAS NOT WALKING
WITH THE CANE ANYMORE.
SEE, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW.
THE DRUG INDUSTRY
WANTS TO MAKE MONEY
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.
THE DO NOT WANT TO CURE DISEASE.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO
PREVENT DISEASE.
IF THEY DID,
THEY'D BE OUT OF BUSINESS.
NOW, I'VE ONLY GOT
A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEFT,
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT.
THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY
SPECIFICALLY
AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY
IN GENERAL
IS KNOWINGLY AND PURPOSELY
PUTTING SECRET INGREDIENTS,
CHEMICALS, IN THE FOOD
WE'RE EATING IN AMERICA
TO PURPOSELY MAKE YOU
ADDICTED TO THE FOOD.
OH, I KNOW,
I BELIEVE THAT.
TO MAKE YOU HUNGRIER
AND MAKE YOU FAT.
PEOPLE SAY, "IS THIS TRUE?"
YES. LET ME TELL YOU.
THERE'S A LAWSUIT
GOING ON RIGHT NOW
WHERE MY INSIDERS TELL ME
THAT WHEN
THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS
OF SOME OF THE LARGEST
FOOD MANUFACTURERS IN AMERICA
HAVE BEEN SUBPOENAED,
THEY'RE FINDING INGREDIENTS THAT
ARE NOT LISTED ON THE LABEL,
THAT ARE BEING, IN EFFECT,
ILLEGALLY PUT INTO THE FOOD.
THE REASON THEY CAN
GET AWAY WITH IT IS BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T
REVERSE-ANALYZE IT OUT.
THAT'S WHY WHEN PEOPLE
COME FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES
TO AMERICA
AND THEY EAT "A NORMAL DIET,"
THEY BLOW UP LIKE A BALLOON.
AND I'VE DISCOVERED THIS
AND I TALK ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK,
I TALK ABOUT THE WAYS
TO ERADICATE OBESITY.
IF A PERSON'S
HUNGRY ALL THE TIME,
THERE ARE WAYS TO GET RID
OF THAT HUNGER NATURALLY.
WELL, SEE,
DIET SODAS, FOR ONE THING.
DIET SODAS MAKE YOU WANT TO
EAT SOMETHING WITH THEM.
EXACTLY.
AND THEY COME VERY, VERY--
YOU WANT ONE
ALL THE TIME.
I WANT TO KEEP ONE AROUND
ALL THE TIME.
BILL O'REILLY ON FOX NEWS SAID
IT'S BEING CALLED THE NEW CRACK.
BECAUSE IT CAN BE SO
PHYSICALLY ADDICTING
AND IN MY OPINION
ACTUALLY MAKES YOU
AND INCREASES YOUR APPETITE.
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
IS AN INGREDIENT
BEING PUT IN THE FOOD
THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES
PEOPLE'S WEIGHT.

>> Announcer: THE FOLLOWING
PROGRAM IS A PAID ADVERTISEMENT
FOR ALCiS, THE SCIENCE
OF RELIEF.
ARE YOU MISSING OUT ON THE
SIMPLE PLEASURES IN LIFE?
ARE YOU UNABLE TO LIVE
AN ACTIVE, HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
BECAUSE YOUR JOINTS ARE SORE
AND HURT?
DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE JUST NOT
LIVING EACH DAY WITH PASSION AND
VIGOR BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT FEELING
YOUR BEST?
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DISCOVER
A NONINVASIVE, NONPRESCRIPTION,
DOCTOR-RECOMMENDED MEDICAL
BREAKTHROUGH THAT COULD
LITERALLY CHANGE HOW YOU MANAGE
YOUR PAIN AND ALLOW YOU TO LIVE
THE LIFE YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.
IF YOUR LIFE IS HELD BACK BY
ARTHRITIS, IF YOU ARE INHIBITED
FROM LIVING YOUR LIFE FULLY
BECAUSE OF BACK PAIN, SHOULDER
PAIN, IF YOU SUFFER FROM
FIBROMYALGIA OR ANY OTHER
CHRONIC PAIN, YOU NEED TO
STAY TUNED.
IF YOU'VE JUST PULLED A MUSCLE
AND WANT IMMEDIATE RELIEF,
YOU NEED TO STAY TUNED.
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BEING
HELD BACK, EVEN IF IT'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT, FROM LIVING YOUR
LIFE FULLY BECAUSE YOU ARE
IN PAIN, OR IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
ARE UNABLE TO DO ALL THE THINGS
YOU USED TO DO BECAUSE OF
THE ACHES, PAINS AND STIFFNESS
WE OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH GETTING
OLDER, YOU NEED TO STAY TUNED.
IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL
MEDICATIONS AND DON'T WANT TO
RELY ON TAKING POTENTIALLY TOXIC
PILLS, DON'T GO AWAY, BECAUSE
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DISCOVER
A PATENTED SOLUTION THAT IS SO
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED AND
REVOLUTIONARY THAT DOCTORS, PAIN
SPECIALISTS, RHEUMATOLOGISTS AND
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY ARE NOW RECOMMENDING IT
TO THEIR PATIENTS
WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION.
IT'S CALLED ALCiS, AND IT IS THE
TRUE SCIENCE OF PAIN RELIEF.
ALCiS IS QUICKLY BECOMING
THE PREFERRED PAIN SOLUTION FOR
PAIN SPECIALISTS AND MEDICAL
DOCTORS EVERYWHERE.
WITH ALCiS, PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO
BE MORE ACTIVE AND LIVE
THE LIVES THEY WANT, PAIN-FREE
AND FULFILLED.
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ACTIVITIES--
WALKING, BIKING, GOLF, GARDENING
OR JUST WORKING AROUND THE
HOUSE-- ALCiS CAN ALLOW YOU TO
ENJOY YOUR ACTIVITIES
TO THE FULLEST.
YOU'VE SEEN IT IN MAGAZINES
LIKE ARTHRITIS TODAY,
FIBROMYALGIA AWARE, U.S. NEWS &
WORLD REPORT AND US WEEKLY.
>> IF I AM IN PAIN, I'M
A PAIN TO BE WITH.
>> THAT KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
CONSTANT, NEVER-ENDING,
GRINDING PAIN.
>> AND IT KIND OF SHOOTS UP AND
DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BACK.
>> MY BACK, MY NECK AND MY LEGS.
>> MY HANDS AND MY NECK AND MY
LOWER BACK.
>> I'M NOT FUN TO BE AROUND
WHEN I'M IN PAIN-- I GET
A LITTLE IRRITABLE.
>> THAT'S WHY ALCiS IS SO GOOD,
BECAUSE IT STOPS IT NOW.
>> IT'S AN AMAZING PRODUCT
THAT WORKS.
>> IT'S GIVEN ME BACK
MY ATTITUDE.
>> I'M HAPPIER, BECAUSE I'M NOT
HURTING AS MUCH.
>> HELLO... LET'S TALK
ABOUT PAIN.
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU
WOKE UP THIS MORNING?
DO YOU HURT ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW?
YOUR BACK? YOUR HANDS?
YOUR KNEES?
IS PAIN AFFECTING THE WAY YOU
LIVE YOUR LIFE?
THE TRUTH IS, MOST OF US HAVE
SOME KIND OF ACHE OR PAIN EVERY
SINGLE DAY...
STRAINS AND BRUISES FROM
INJURIES, ACHING MUSCLES FROM...
JUST LIVING.
OR WHAT ABOUT JOINT PAIN
FROM ARTHRITIS?
WELL, TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT HOW TO END YOUR PAIN,
STARTING WITH A SIMPLE
PHONE CALL.
I'M VERY EXCITED TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO ALCiS DAILY RELIEF.
IT'S A WHOLE NEW WAY TO CONTROL
AND EVEN ELIMINATE YOUR PAIN.
IT'S SIMPLE TO USE, IT'S SAFE,
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.
IN FACT, ALCiS IS UNLIKE
ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER TRIED.
ALCiS IS THE SCIENCE OF RELIEF.
SO WHAT IS ALCiS?
IT'S NOT AN ORAL MEDICATION THAT
AFFECTS YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM AND
CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF
SIDE EFFECTS.
ALCiS TARGETS YOUR PAIN THROUGH
YOUR SKIN, SO IT'S SAFE TO USE.
BUT ALCiS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE
OINTMENTS THAT JUST HEAT UP THE
TOP LAYER OF YOUR SKIN, STING
YOUR EYES AND SMELL HORRIBLE.
>> THOSE WHO HAVEN'T TRIED
ALCiS, I WOULD SAY, YOU NEED TO
GIVE IT A SHOT.
>> TRY IT, I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO LOSE, RIGHT?
YOU PUT IT ON, THE PAIN
GOES AWAY.
>> IT WORKS FAST AND IT'S...
STRONG.
>> JUST TRY IT.
>> NOW LET'S LEARN MORE ABOUT
THE AMAZING TECHNOLOGY BEHIND
ALCiS FROM ITS INVENTOR,
DR. BRIAN KELLER.
DR. KELLER HOLDS A Ph.D. IN
PHARMACOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO,
WHERE HE WAS ALSO A PROFESSOR.
HE HAS SPENT HIS CAREER
DEVELOPING REVOLUTIONARY NEW
SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM
OF PAIN.
>> THE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS ARE
REALLY IN DELIVERY SYSTEMS,
GETTING THE DRUG TO THE SITE OF
ACTION, AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF ALCiS.
WE'RE TARGETING PAIN FROM
A TOPICAL PERSPECTIVE RATHER
THAN AN ORAL INTERVENTION
BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S SAFER,
WE THINK IT'S MORE DIRECT
AT THE SITE OF ACTION, AND WE
GET FASTER RESULTS.
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR
CLINICAL TRIALS IS THAT PEOPLE
GET RELIEF IN AS SOON AS
FIVE MINUTES.
THE ONSET IS QUICK, AND THEN IT
CAN LAST UP TO SIX HOURS.
MOST OF THE CREAMS THAT ARE
ON THE MARKET, THAT DON'T SMELL
GOOD, THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
LIKE TO USE, CONTAIN WHAT ARE
CALLED COUNTERIRRITANTS.
THESE ARE IRRITATING, JUST AS
THEIR TITLE SAYS.
THEY'RE IRRITATING THE SKIN AND
THEY CONFUSE THE PERCEPTION OF
PAIN WITHOUT ACTUALLY
ELIMINATING THE PAIN.
ALCiS DOESN'T BURN, IT DOESN'T
CONFUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, IT
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE PAIN AND
STARTS TO WORK.
>> Host: NOW LET'S MEET DOUG.
WHEN HIS DOCTOR TOLD HIM TO SLOW
DOWN, DOUG HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE,
AND THAT'S WHERE ALCiS CAME IN.
>> Doug: I WAS PLAYING
COMPETITIVE BASKETBALL WITH SOME
GUYS I PLAY WITH EVERY SATURDAY
MORNING, AND I TOOK A CHARGE,
AND I ENDED UP RIGHT ON
MY TAILBONE.
I WENT TO A GOOD SPORTS DOC AND
HE SAID THERE WERE THREE
ALTERNATIVES: YOU CAN TAKE
A PRESCRIPTION PAINKILLER;
YOU CAN INJECT IT WITH
CORTISONE, WHICH IS A STEROID;
OR YOU CAN HAVE IT
OPERATED ON...
AND OPTION TWO AND THREE DIDN'T
WORK FOR ME, SO I TOOK
THE PAINKILLER.
I DID GET SOME RELIEF FROM THAT.
PAINKILLERS IN GENERAL DON'T
AGREE WITH MY STOMACH,
AND I STARTED USING
ALCiS ON MY LOWER BACK.
USING ALCiS JUST MADE A LOT OF
SENSE TO ME BECAUSE IT'S
A TOPICAL PAIN RELIEVER.
AND THESE OTHERS ARE SYSTEMIC,
SO IF YOUR BACK HURTS AND YOU
TAKE ONE OF THE PAINKILLERS,
YOU GET AS MUCH IN YOUR ANKLE
AS YOU DO IN YOUR BACK.
AND I FIND OUT THAT BY BEING
ACTIVE IN SPORTS, IT REALLY DOES
BALANCE MY LIFE.
BUT YOU CAN'T PARTICIPATE
AGGRESSIVELY IN A PHYSICAL
ACTIVITY IF YOU HURT.
ALCiS TAKES AWAY THE PAIN,
AND IT WILL NOT DISTURB THE REST
OF YOUR SYSTEM.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY
REVOLUTIONARY.
>> DOUG... WHAT AN AMAZING
61-YEAR-OLD.
WHAT A STORY.
WITH HIS ACTIVE LIFESTYLE,
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT WON'T BE
HIS LAST INJURY.
BUT THANKS TO ALCiS DAILY
RELIEF, THE PAIN WON'T HOLD HIM
BACK FROM LIVING THE LIFE
HE CHOOSES.
A FEW WEEKS AGO WE GAVE ALCiS
DAILY RELIEF TO A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU WHO
SUFFER FROM ALL KINDS OF ACHES
AND PAINS.
WE ASKED THEM TO TRY IT, AND
THEN INVITED THEM BACK TO TALK
ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES.
LET'S HEAR WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.
>> I WAS INTRIGUED, BUT I WAS
A LITTLE SKEPTICAL.
>> BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IF IT
DOESN'T SMELL LIKE MEDICATED,
IT SHOULDN'T WORK.
>> I WAS SKEPTICAL, BECAUSE I'VE
TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
AND THEY'VE NEVER WORKED.
>> BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THE PAIN STOPS.
>> I WAS AMAZED AT HOW QUICKLY
IT WORKED.
>> PUT THE ALCiS CREAM ON,
AND WITHIN ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
NO MORE PAIN.
>> ALCiS IS MY NEW BEST FRIEND.
>> ORDINARY PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
ARE EXCITED ABOUT ALCiS DAILY
RELIEF, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
MEDICAL COMMUNITY?
LET'S MEET DR. JOHN MASSEY.
HE'S A GRADUATE OF STANFORD
UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,
HE'S BOARD CERTIFIED IN BOTH
PAIN MANAGEMENT AND
ANESTHESIOLOGY, AND HE'S
A PARTNER IN THE BAY AREA
PAIN CENTER.
THE CENTER CURRENTLY HAS 10,000
ACTIVE PATIENTS.
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A MAN WHO
KNOWS ABOUT TREATING PAIN.
...DR. MASSEY, WHY IS ALCiS SUCH
AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH FOR
PEOPLE WITH PAIN?
>> IN MY OPINION, ALCiS IS A
SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH
IN THAT IT PROVIDES PAIN
MEDICINES IN A WAY THAT IS
BRAND-NEW, IS TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED, IS EASY TO TAKE, AND
ACTUALLY IS QUITE SAFE.
IN MY OPINION, IT'S GOING TO BE
A VERY BIG DEAL.
YOU HAVE A LIPOSOMAL DELIVERY
SYSTEM THAT CAN ACTUALLY TAKE
PAIN MEDICINES DEEP INTO THE
SKIN, THAT GIVE IT EFFECTIVENESS
THAT PREVIOUSLY WASN'T SEEN
WITH TOPICAL MEDICATIONS,
THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY
TOXICITIES, DOESN'T HAVE ANY
INTERACTIONS WITH ANY OTHER
MEDICATIONS THAT MY
PATIENTS TAKE.
>> NOW THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT
ALCiS, IT'S TIME TO LET IT
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
WE'RE ABOUT TO TELL YOU HOW TO
ORDER, BUT FIRST, IF YOU KNOW
SOMEONE WHO HAS PAIN FROM
A PHYSICALLY DEMANDING JOB,
INVITE THEM TO JOIN US FOR
LARS' STORY, COMING RIGHT UP.
>> Announcer: ARE YOU IN PAIN
AND YOUR LIFE IS BEING HELD BACK
BECAUSE OF ARTHRITIS?
ARE YOU NOT LIVING A COMPLETE

PERHAPS YOU HAVE FIBROMYALGIA,
WITH ITS CHRONIC PAIN
CONTROLLING YOUR LIFE.
OR MAYBE YOU'VE JUST PULLED
A MUSCLE AND NEED SOME RELIEF.
NO MATTER HOW MINOR OR SEVERE,
PAIN CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE
INCOMPLETE BY TAKING AWAY YOUR
ABILITY TO BE COMPLETELY
WHO YOU ARE, TO BE WHO YOU WANT
AND ASPIRE TO BE.
FINALLY, YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO
BE CONTROLLED BY PAIN.
IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE AND
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TOXIC

AND DON'T WORK, THEN LISTEN TO

PROGRAM, YOU'D BE FEELING
BETTER ALREADY.
ALCiS GOES TO WORK IN AS LITTLE
AS FIVE MINUTES, AND THE
SOOTHING RELIEF LASTS FOR HOURS.
...DR. MASSEY, EXACTLY WHAT
TYPES OF PAIN CAN BE HELPED BY
ALCiS DAILY RELIEF?
>> IT CERTAINLY IS A GREAT
TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE
PAIN THAT WON'T GO AWAY, PAIN
THAT PERSISTS EVERY DAY.
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR
PATIENTS WHO SUFFER
FROM ARTHRITIS?
>> I HAVE LOADS OF PATIENTS THAT
HAVE ARTHRITIS.
AND MOST COMMONLY, I SEE
A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO COMPLAIN
OF HAND PAIN.
THE ELDERLY POPULATION PUTS
CREAM ON THEIR HANDS, I WILL
TELL YOU, EVERY DAY.
IMAGINE IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY
HAVE THEM DELIVER THEIR
MEDICATIONS FOR PAIN THE SAME
WAY, AT THE SAME TIME.
IT'S SEAMLESS.
>> PAIN CAN KEEP US ALL FROM
DOING WHAT WE WANT TO DO, AND
SOMETIMES IT CAN EVEN STOP US
FROM DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
LARS SIMPLY COULDN'T AFFORD TO
LET THAT HAPPEN, SO FOR HIM,
ALCiS IS HOPE.
HERE'S HIS STORY.
>> I'M LARS ANDREWS.
I AM A MOUNTAIN GUIDE,
INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED
MOUNTAIN GUIDE.
...I HELI-SKI AND SKI TOUR
AND CLIMB.
THAT'S MY OCCUPATION.
...ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, I HAD
A FALL AND SLID DOWN
A MOUNTAINSIDE, BASICALLY,
AND TORE MY... DESTROYED MY
RIGHT KNEE.
AND TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE
PAIN THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE ACCIDENT AND THE SUBSEQUENT
SURGERY, I WAS TAKING 12, 13
PILLS A DAY.
THIS PAST SUMMER, WE'D GONE UP
THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN I TURNED
AROUND AT THE END OF THE DAY TO
DESCEND, I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
OVERCOME BY PAIN IN MY KNEE.
AT THAT POINT I REALIZED THERE
WAS NO... THERE WAS NO POINT IN
ME EVEN TRYING TO CONTINUE ON
GUIDING THAT SUMMER, IF AT ALL.
MY FIRST EXPEDITION
AFTER I STARTED USING ALCiS WAS
A PRETTY GNARLY EXPEDITION, AND
IT WAS EXTREMELY PHYSICAL AND
EXTREMELY HARD ON MY KNEES.
I USED IT EVERY DAY
ON THAT TRIP.
IT WORKED GREAT, I WAS PAIN-FREE
EVERY DAY, AND THEN I USED IT
FROM THEN ON, YEAH.
ALCiS IS SIMPLE.
IT'S JUST, YOU PUT IT ON IN THE
MORNING, IT'S JUST PART OF THAT
RITUAL, YOU KNOW?
I PUT MY SUNSCREEN ON MY FACE
AND PUT ALCiS ON MY KNEE, AND
THEN AWAY I GO.
ALCiS GIVES ME MY LIFE BACK.
>> NO MATTER WHAT YOUR JOB IS,
IF YOU HAVE PAIN, IT'S MAKING
YOUR WORK HARDER THAN IT
HAS TO BE.
SO WHY NOT TRY ALCiS AND CHANGE
THE WAY YOU FEEL?
NOW LET'S GO BACK TO
DR. BRIAN KELLER, WHO HOLDS
A Ph.D. IN PHARMACOLOGY FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
AT SAN FRANCISCO AND IS THE
INVENTOR OF THIS EXCITING
TECHNOLOGY.
>> THE ALCiS CREAM IS A WHOLE
NEW APPROACH TO STOPPING PAIN,
BY TAKING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT,
ENHANCING ITS PERMEATION INTO
LOWER LAYERS OF THE SKIN AND
DIRECTLY STOPPING THE PAIN.
THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM IS BASED ON
THE ABILITY OF THIS MICROSCOPIC
ENVELOPE THAT ENCAPSULATES THE
ACTIVE INGREDIENT AND THEN TAKES
IT DOWN INTO LOWER LAYERS OF THE
SKIN TO BETTER RELIEVE PAIN.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ON THE
MARKET LIKE THIS.
THIS IS A REVOLUTION, AND WE
ACTUALLY RECEIVED A PATENT
BECAUSE IT'S SO UNIQUE AND
SO BRAND-NEW.
>> I LOVE THE FACT THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO TAKE AN INTERNAL...
MEDICATION.
>> RIGHT NOW, ALCiS IS THE
ONLY THING THAT I'M USING.
>> IT'S A GREAT BREAKTHROUGH
BECAUSE IT WORKS SO QUICKLY.
>> FIVE TO 10 MINUTES IS
ALL IT TAKES.
>> IT LASTS FOR HOURS D HOURS.
>> PUT IT ON AND ALMOST
FORGET THAT YOU'VE DONE IT,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THINK,
"HEY, THIS FEELS BETTER."
>> IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH
ARTHRITIS, PLEASE INVITE THEM
TO JOIN YOU FOR JOYCE'S STORY,
COMING RIGHT UP.
HER PAIN WAS KEEPING HER FROM
DOING THE THINGS SHE LOVED UNTIL
ALCiS CHAND HER LIFE.

>> FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST
TUNED IN, DR. JOHN MASSEY IS
A STANFORD UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
SCHOOL GRADUATE AS WELL AS
A PHYSICIAN SPECIALIZING IN
PAIN MANAGEMENT.
>> PATIENTS THAT I SEE ARE
OFTEN ON WHAT WE WOULD CALL
COCKTAILS OF MEDICATIONS.
THEY MAY BE ON THREE, FOUR,
FIVE OR EVEN SIX DIFFERENT
MEDICINES.
ALCiS IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW
TO DELIVER MEDICINES THAT REALLY
WOULDN'T AFFECT ANY OF THESE
OTHER MECHANISMS OF ACTION,
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TOXICITY, AND
WOULD LIKELY THEN ALLOW THE
PATIENTS TO TAKE LESS OF OTHER
KINDS OF MEDICATIONS THEY'RE
CURRENTLY TAKING.
>> WHAT BENEFITS DOES ALCiS
OFFER YOUR PATIENTS THAT THEY
HAVEN'T HAD BEFORE?
>> WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
NEW OR DIFFERENT MEDICINES, BUT
BY AND LARGE, THESE ARE ALL
MEDICATIONS THAT HAVE SOME
SIGNIFICANT RISKS, SOME
SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS, AND
I THINK PATIENTS ARE VERY LEERY
IN TRYING THEM.
IF I CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH
A SAFE ALTERNATIVE, LIKE ALCiS,
IT'S MY DUTY TO DO SO.
>> ALCiS IS AMAZING.
>> IT'S GIVEN ME BACK THE
ABILITY TO DO THE THINGS
THAT I LIKE TO DO.
>> ALCiS IS A WAY TO GET BACK
INTO THE GAME.
>> ALCiS IS...
FOR ME, A MIRACLE.
>> IF YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS, YOU
PROBABLY KNOW ALL ABOUT
COX-2 INHIBITORS.
THEY WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR
UNTIL GOVERNMENT REGULATORY
AGENCIES AND PHYSICIANS ALERTED
US TO THEIR SERIOUS RISK OF
HEART ATTACK AND STROKE.
>> MEDICINES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY
DID NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY
PROBLEMS ARE NOW, YOU KNOW,
BEING HAILED AS HAVING
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS.
I THINK PATIENTS ARE GONNA
BECOME MORE AND MORE WARY OF ME
GIVING THEM A DIFFERENT PILL.
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A TOPICAL
LIKE ALCiS THAT'S GONNA BE
EFFECTIVE AND THAT ISN'T GONNA
HAVE ANY DRUG INTERACTIONS
IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE.
>> SPEAKING OF THE SIDE EFFECTS
OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, LISTEN
TO THIS.
"TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE
FLUID RETENTION, KIDNEY
OR LIVER PROBLEMS.
IN RARE CASES, SERIOUS STOMACH
PROBLEMS SUCH AS G.I. BLEEDING
CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING.
THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS
IN CLINICAL TRIALS WERE
INDIGESTION, DIARRHEA, ABDOMINAL
PAIN AND VOMITING."
WITH ALCiS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.
IT'S AVAILABLE WITHOUT
A PRESCRIPTION, IT'S SAFE, IT
WON'T INTERFERE WITH ANY OTHER
TREATMENT YOU'RE USING, AND IT
WILL RELIEVE YOUR PAIN.
NOW IT'S TIME TO MEET JOYCE.
SHE HAS A DRAWER FULL OF
EXPENSIVE OINTMENTS THAT SHE
USED A FEW TIMES BUT THEN
STOPPED BECAUSE THEY WERE MORE
UNPLEASANT THAN HELPFUL.
SOUND FAMILIAR?
SHE TRIED PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING
BEFORE SHE DISCOVERED THAT, FOR
HER, ALCiS IS FREEDOM.
>> ALCiS HAS CHANGED MY
LIFE BECAUSE IT'S CHA... IT'S
MADE ME BE ABLE TO BE ME.
IT'S MADE IT... ME NOT HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT PAIN ALL THE TIME.
I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH
ARTHRITIS IN 1982, AND IT,
IT WAS PRETTY FULL-BLOWN ONSET,
SO IT CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE.
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE MADE ALL
MY CLOTHES AND MY CHILDREN'S
CLOTHES, BUT WHEN THE ARTHRITIS
GOT SO BAD I COULDN'T SEW
ANYMORE... THAT REALLY...
IT WAS LIKE A PIECE MISSING OUT
OF MY LIFE, NOT BEING ABLE
TO SEW.
WHEN YOU HURT BAD ENOUGH,
YOU'RE GONNA TRY ANYTHING.
ALCiS FEELS LIKE... IT DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE MEDICINE, IT FEELS
LIKE I'M JUST PUTTING ON THIS
VERY ELEGANT HAND CREAM
OR SOMETHING.
SO IT FEELS GOOD, AND THEN
IT HELPS. [LAUGHS]
IT'S ALMOST LIKE TAKING A DEEP
BREATH WHEN IT STARTS TO WORK,
AND IT'S LIKE... [EXHALES]
SIGH, BACK TO WORK.
WELL, THAT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY.
IF I COULD USE ONE WORD TO
DESCRIBE WHAT IT MEANS TO ME,
IT WOULD BE "FREEDOM."
BECAUSE OF ALCiS, I CAN
SEW AGAIN.
AND I SPEND A LOT OF MY TIME NOW
FORGETTING PAIN.
I LIKE THAT.
THEN, THEN I GET TO BE ME AGAIN.
>> ARE YOU ONE OF THE 70 MILLION
AMERICANS LIKE JOYCE WHO
HAVE ARTHRITIS?
NOW YOU CAN BECOME ONE OF THE
GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE FINALLY FOUND RELIEF
WITH ALCiS.
>> Dr. Keller: MOST OF THE
CREAMS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET
THAT DON'T SMELL GOOD,
THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
LIKE TO USE, CONTAIN WHAT ARE
CALLED COUNTERIRRITANTS.
THESE ARE IRRITATING, JUST AS
THEIR TITLE SAYS.
THEY'RE IRRITATING THE SKIN AND
THEY CONFUSE THE PERCEPTION OF
PAIN WITHOUT ACTUALLY
ELIMINATING THE PAIN.
ALCiS DOESN'T BURN, IT DOESN'T
CONFUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, IT
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE PAIN
AND STARTS TO WORK.
>> I DON'T LIKE THE HOT
EXPERIENCES, I DON'T LIKE THE
FREEZING COLD EXPERIENCES.
>> I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING,
FROM CREAMS, PATCHES,
THE LIQUID HEAT STUFF
WHERE IT FEELS LIKE YOUR SKIN'S
ABOUT TO BE, YOU KNOW,
IS ON FIRE.
BUT ALCiS... PERFECT.
>> I WAS SURPRISED 'CAUSE IT
DIDN'T SMELL MEDICATED
BUT IT ACTUALLY DID THE WORK.
>> IT HAS A FRESH, BEAUTIFUL
FRAGRANCE AND... THE BEST PART
IS IT WORKS.
>> ONCE YOU TRY IT,
YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT'S
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.
>> I MEAN, I CAN WHOLEHEARTEDLY
ENDORSE IT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT'S
BEEN... WHAT IT'S DONE FOR ME,
WHAT IT'S ENABLED ME TO DO.
>> JUST TRY IT.
MEASURE IT AND SEE IF IT
HELPS YOU.
I WOULD SURELY HOPE IT HELPS
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE IT HELPS ME.
>> I'M A VERY CONSERVATIVE
DOCTOR AND I ACTUALLY TAKE...
I THINK I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF
MY PATIENTS AND I WOULD NOT
EXPOSE THEM TO SOMETHING THAT
I PERSONALLY DIDN'T THINK WAS
SAFE, EFFECTIVE AND LIKELY TO
HELP THEM IN THE LONG RUN.
AND SO, WHEN I HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY ALCiS, IT WAS
EVERYTHING I WAS LOOKING FOR
IN A PAIN MEDICINE.
>> WELL, WE'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME.
YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS,
YOU'VE LISTENED TO LIFE-CHANGING
STORIES FROM DOUG, JOYCE AND
LARS, AND YOU'VE SEEN COUNTLESS
OTHER PEOPLE SHARING THEIR
INCREDIBLE RESULTS FROM
USING ALCiS.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO EXPERIENCE
THE END OF YOUR PAIN.
SO GRAB A PAD AND PEN IF YOU
HAVEN'T ALREADY, BECAUSE THIS IS
OUR LAST CHANCE TO GIVE YOU THE
INFORMATION YOU'LL NEED TO
ORDER ALCiS.
>> IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
CHRONIC PAIN, IF YOU HAVE
PROBLEMS WITH MUSCLE STRAINS,
ACHES, PAINS, AND YOU'RE TAKING
PILLS EVERY DAY TO MANAGE THIS,
HERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO
TAKING PILLS.
THIS ALTERNATIVE IS SAFE,
IT'S EASY TO USE, IT'S PLEASANT
TO USE, AND IT WORKS.
>> Announcer: ARE YOU IN PAIN
AND YOUR LIFE IS BEING HELD BACK
BECAUSE OF ARTHRITIS?
ARE YOU NOT LIVING A COMPLETE
LIFE BECAUSE OF BACK OR
SHOULDER PAIN?
PERHAPS YOU HAVE FIBROMYALGIA,
WITH ITS CHRONIC PAIN
CONTROLLING YOUR LIFE.
OR MAYBE YOU'VE JUST PULLED
A MUSCLE AND NEED SOME RELIEF.
NO MATTER HOW MINOR OR SEVERE,
PAIN CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE
INCOMPLETE BY TAKING AWAY YOUR
ABILITY TO BE COMPLETELY
WHO YOU ARE, TO BE WHO YOU WANT
AND ASPIRE TO BE.
FINALLY, YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO
BE CONTROLLED BY PAIN.
IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE AND
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TOXIC
SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL
MEDICATIONS, IF YOU WASTED MONEY
ON SMELLY CREAMS THAT ONLY BURN
AND DON'T WORK, THEN LISTEN TO
THE MEDICAL EXPERTS AND DOCTORS
WHO ARE RECOMMENDING
ALCiS DAILY RELIEF.

A PRESCRIPTION AND YOU DON'T

there are others who need
our help...
Some people have eyes to see
a friend in need of help... 
Let's work on your reading,

Good job, Max! Thanks.

I DON'T HAVE
ANY POINTS, SO...

OCCASIONAL AMERICAN BRAVADO.
HE SAID AFTER THE WIN OVER THE

AN GOES ABOUT THE GAME AND DOES 
HIS BUSINESS.

DEFENDER BUT A VERY SMART 
DEFENDER, A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

DEEP TEAM.

TO GET IN THE NEXT ROUND IS A

BETTER GOAL DIFFERENT SHALLOW 
THAN THE CZECH REPUBLIC.

WHAT ?
(talk show host)
We're back with the GEICO Gecko.
(talk show host) So now here's
the thing I don't understand,
people could save...
hundreds of dollars on car
insurance by switching to GEICO.
Right.
(talk show host) So, I have to
ask, why does GEICO even need a
talking gecko?
Well, entertainment.
(talk show host)
How's that?
Look, you can't just tell
people that GEICO could
save'em money...
it's true, yes, but it's a bit
boring. So you...
have a little gecko
entertain, play a little
guitar or whatever.
They think they're watching
entertaining television, but
they're actually watching...
[whispering]
a commercial.
(male narrator)
GEICO. Fifteen minutes
could save you...
fifteen percent or
more on car insurance.

THERE IS TO KNOW

YOU MAY BE WRONG.

YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO GET

EVEN MORE SURPRISING,
THIS CHOLESTEROL MEDICINE
DOES BOTH.
CRESTOR.
CRESTOR, ALONG WITH DIET,
CAN LOWER BAD CHOLESTEROL
BY UP TO 52%.
BUT CRESTOR ALSO RAISES
YOUR GOOD CHOLESTEROL.

IS CRESTOR RIGHT FOR YOU?
THAT'S BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR DOCTOR.
CRESTOR IS NOT FOR EVERYONE,
INCLUDING PEOPLE
WITH LIVER DISEASE,
AND WOMEN WHO ARE NURSING,
PREGNANT
OR MAY BECOME PREGNANT.
SIMPLE BLOOD TESTS ARE NEEDED
TO CHECK FOR LIVER PROBLEMS.
TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT OTHER
MEDICATIONS YOU'RE TAKING,
OR IF YOU EXPERIENCE

AS THEY MAY BE A SIGN
OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS.
DOWN WITH THE BAD.

>> BUT DONOVAN IS THE MAN THIS 
TEAM HAS TO FEND ON AND THEY 
COULDN'T DEPEND ON HIM. 
>> WELL, YES AND NO.
IT WOULD BE TOO EASY TO BLAME 
IT ALL ON HIM.
I MENTIONED EARLY ON THAT SOME 
OF THE PLAYERS DIDN'T PERFORM 
WELL BEFORE THE FIRST CUP, 
MARCUS BEASLEY WAS ONE OF THEM. 
THIS YEAR, KIND OF PLAYED OUT 
OF POSITION, PLAYED ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE, MIDFIELD, I THINK 
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT 
BRUCE ARENA FELT THAT MAYBE HE 
CAN USE HIM THERE.
I FEEL IT WAS A MISTAKE.
I THINK THAT MARCUS BEASLEY 
SHOULD HAVE PLAYED ON THE 
LEFT-HAND SIDE. 
OBVIOUSLY, DEMPSTER HAS PROVEN 
TO US HOW GOOD A PLAYER HE CAN 
BE. 
THIS IS ONE PLAYER FOR ME THAT 
RALLY THE PRESSURE NEVER REALLY 
GOT TO HIM. 
HE JUST WENT OUT WITH 
INEXPERIENCE AND PLAYED VERY 
WELL. 
>> BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, 
MARCUS BEASLEY DID HIS JOB 
TODAY.
HE WAS ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE, 
SET UP A PERFECT GOAL.
I KNOW THAT DEMPSTER TOOK HIS 
GOAL WITH A LOT OF -- DEMPSEY 
TOOK HIS GOAL WITH A LOT OF 
CONFIDENCE. 
THIS GUY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND 
THE WAY HE FINISHED IT OFF WAS 
A THING OF BEAUTY.
HE HIT IT A TON.
>> BUT WE DIDN'T PLAY LIKE THIS 
TEAM IS USED TO.
THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEERLEADING 
BEFORE THE WORLD CUP BECAUSE OF 
WHAT HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. 
WE WERE VIRTUALLY UNKNOWNS FOUR 
YEARS AGO.
PEOPLE ARE COMING AT US WITH 
SPEED.
ALL OF THOSE TEAMS HAVE PLENTY 
OF SPEED. 
THE CZECH REPUBLIC SHOWED US 
HOW QUICK AND GOOD THEY CAN BE 
WITH THE BALL AND WE JUST -- 
YOU KNOW, WE JUST RAN WITH THE 
BALL A LITTLE BIT, DIDN'T MOVE 
IT QUICKLY MUCH OF, AND 
CERTAINLY I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I 
LOOK AT LANDON DONOVAN,-- 
>> THERE WERE TIMES TODAY THAT 
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS CRAWLING 
COMPARED TO THE GHANIANS. 
THEY HAD A LOT OF TEAM SPEED, 
BROKE VERY WELL WITH THE BALL, 
YOU WERE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH 
THE BALL, AND THAT'S THE KEY 
THING, TO FIT THE RUN IN STRIDE 
WITH THE BALL.
>> ALL RIGHT. 
GUYS, MUCH TO DISCUSS INCLUDING 
THE FUTURE OF U.S.A. SOCCER.
WHEN WE COME BACK, BRUCE ARENA 
WILL -- WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM, 
HIS POSTGAME REMARKS AS TEAM 
U.S.A. IS DONE. 
A CONTROVERSIAL CALL DID NOT 
HELP THE CAUSE. 
STAY WITH US.
UNLOCKED THE DOORS WHEN HER
DRESS AND KEYS WERE INSIDE.
GOT AN E-MAIL FROM HER CAR.
CONTACTED HELP WHEN HIS
SON STOPPED BREATHING. 
HELPED FIND HIS DREAM CAR
AFTER IT WAS STOLEN. 
MADE A CALL EVEN WHEN 
HIS CELL PHONE COULDN'T.
>> TEAM U.S.A. AND GHANA, LATE 
FIRST HALF, STOPPAGE TIME, IF 
YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, ONYEWU 
CALLED FOR THE PENALTY, 
CONTROVERSIAL CALL, STEPHEN 
APPIAH WITH A CHANCE ON A 
PENALTY KICK, AS A RESULT OF 
THIS PENALTY AND WITH THE GAME 
TIED AT 1-1, APPIAH IS ABLE TO 
CONVERT ON THE PENALTY KICK.
IT PUTS GHANA UP 2-1 AT THE 
HALF AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE 
THE FINAL SCORE, AS TEAM U.S.A. 
IS ELIMINATED.
MORE NOW FROM THE MEN WHO 
CALLED THE GAME, DAVE O'BRIEN 
AND MARCELLO BALBOA. 
>> THERE WAS THAT GLIMMER OF 
HOPE WHEN CLINT DEMPSEY GOT ON 
THE RUN, GOT A SERVICE FROM 
BEASLEY IN THE FIRST HALF, 
STUCK IT IN THE BACK OF THE 
NET, U.S.A. HAD TIED IT AT 1-1. 
FOR THAT FREE THING MOMENT IT 
LOOKED LIKE THE U.S.A.'S DREAMS 
JUST MITT COME TRUE.
TODAY JUST NOT MEANT TO BE. 
WHAT WENT WRONG OUT HERE? 
>> EVERYTHING WENT WRONG. 
THE PLAYERS DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH 
ENERGY, I THINK THE COACHING, 
THE TACTICAL PLAN, THE 
SCOUTING, I THINK EVERYTHING 
WAS OFF.
JUST NOT ENOUGH ENERGY. 
YOU'RE PUTTING PLAYERS OUT OF 
POSITION. 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PLAY PLAYERS 
WHERE THEY'RE COMFORTABLE THEY 
PLAY THEIR BEST.
YOU HATE TO SAY IT BUT LANGDON 
DONOVAN DIDN'T SHOW UP, 
DAMARCUS BEASLEY DIDN'T SHOW UP 
AND IN 2002, THOSE GUYS STOOD 
AT THE PLATE AND CARRIED THE 
TEAM. 
THEM TIME THEY DIDN'T STAND UP 
AND PLAY WHERE THEY'RE GOING 
HOME. 
>> WHEN BRUCE ARENA TRIES TO 
PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER IN A 
FIRST-ROUND EXIT, WHERE DOES HE 
START?
>> THEY HAVE TO FIRST SIT DOWN 
AND THINK, DOES BRUCE ARENA 
KEEP HIS JOB. 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT A 
SITUATION, THE COACH THAT'S 
BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, 
DEMOTIVATE HIS PLAYERS, DID HE 
PUT THE BEST PLAYERS OUT ON THE 
FIELD?
THAT'S ONE. 
THAT'S WHERE U.S. SOCCER HAS TO 
GO FIRST. 
EVALUATE THE BRUCE ARENA 
SITUATION AND THEN YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
THE PLAYERS HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THEMSELVES AND SAY YOU CAN ONLY 
BLAME THE COACH FOR HALF, THE 
PLAYERS HAVE TO TAKE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OTHER 
HALF. 
THEY HAVE TO REALIZE THEY 
DIDN'T COME OUT AND PLAY THIS 
TOURNAMENT, THEY'RE GOING HOME. 
U.S. SOCCER HAS A LOT TO REDO.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY 
UNDERSTOOD JUST HOW GOOD GHANA 
IS, AS THEY MOVE ON WITH ITALY 
OUT OF A VERY TOUGH GROUP, AND 
THE UNITED STATES IS GOING 
HOME, I'M DAVE O'BRIEN, LET'S 
GO BACK TO THE STUDIO.
>> GUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE WILL HEAR 
FROM BRUCE ARENA ON HIS TEAM'S 
ELIMINATION, THE TOUGH CALL 
THERE LATE IN THE FIRST HALF 
LED TO THE PENALTY KICK.
GHANA MOVING ON, TEAM U.S.A. 
GOING HOME. 
WE'RE BACK WITH MORE AFTER 
THIS.
>> AND WE'RE BACK.
WORLD CUP FINISHES -- WORST 
WORLD CUP FINISHES ALL-TIME, 
AND THIS IS ON THE LIST, THE 
2006, 1991 THE WORST, 1998 NOT 
GOOD EITHER.
1934 AND THEN THE 0-2-1 MARK 
THAT WAS JUST CONCLUDED HERE IN 
2006. 
BACK IN THE STUDIO, REJOINED BY 
OUR GUESTS, AND GUYS, WE WANT 
TO TALK NOW ABOUT THE FUTURE OF 
U.S.A. SOCCER.
TOMMY, YOU'RE FIRST, WHERE DO 
THEY GO FROM HERE?
>> WELL, I THINK THERE'S -- THE 
FUTURE IS VERY BRIGHT FOR THEM. 
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS 
WITH WHAT BRUCE ARENA HAS DONE. 
I THINK HE'S BROUGHT A LOT TO 
THE TABLE, I THINK HE'S DONE A 
LOT FOR THIS TEAM.
BROUGHT A LOT OF PLAYERS ON, 
HE'S MADE SURE THAT EVERY 
PLAYER HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO GET SOME INTERNATIONAL PLAY. 
I THINK HE'S DONE IT ALL, SEEN 
IT ALL. 
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO KEEP 
THE JOB ANY LONGER, MAYBE HE 
WILL PROVE ME WRONG BUT I THINK 
HE WILL MOVE ON AND BUT THAT'S 
JUST MAY TAKE ON IT.
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST ARENA. 
I THINK ARENA HAS DONE A 
MAGNIFICENT JOB FOR U.S. SOCCER 
AND WHATEVER HE GETS, HE 
DESERVES, LET ME TELL YOU.
>> I THINK HE STAYS.
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS, OF 
COURSE. 
ONE DO WE STAY WITH BRUCE ARENA 
OR GO WITH A FOREIGN COACH? 
ABSOLUTELY STAY WITH AN 
AMERICAN COACH. 
THERE ARE PLENTY. 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE 
BRUCE ARENA, WHENEVER IT MAY BE 
BUT I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
COACHES THAT UNDERSTAND THE 
MENTALITY OF THE PLAYERS HERE.
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
ALSO THE NEW PRESIDENT, IF HE'S 
GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE, PERHAPS 
NOW IS THE TIME.
I DO BELIEVE BRUCE ARENA, IF HE 
WANTS TO, HE SHOULD STAY HERE 
AS THE COACH AGAIN. 
>> I THINK BRUCE STAYS MAINLY 
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS 
A BETTER JOB OFFER RIGHT NOW. 
AND THE MAN LIKES TO WORK AND 
HE WANTS TO WORK, AND THE 
BOYNTON IS THIS -- WE MIGHT 
NEED ANOTHER COACH WHOSE 
ADVANCE WOULD HAPPEN UNDER 
BRUCE ARENA.
JUST LIKE BRUCE ARENA TOOK OVER 
FROM HIS PREDECESSOR AND TOOK 
IT TO ANOTHER STEP, MAYBE IT'S 
ANOTHER FOREIGN COACH BUT THE 
KEY IS THIS, IF YOU MAKE THAT 
MOVE AND DO DECIDE TO MOVE 
AWAY, AGREE TO DISAGREE WITH 
BRUCE ARENA AND HAVE HIM LEAVE 
OUT THE DOOR, YOU BETTER HAVE 
SOMEONE IN THERE WHO HAS LEGIT 
CREDENTIALS AND CAN TAKE IT TO 
THE NEXT LEVEL. 
>> IN THAT MENTALITY, THERE 
WOULD BE NOTHING WRONG WITH 
BRINGING IN A NEW MENTALITY.
I MEAN, THE U.S. HAVE HAD THIS 
MENTALITY NOW FOR A NUMBER OF 
YEARS SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH 
BRINGING IN SOMEBODY THAT HAS 
NEW IDEAS, CAN IMPLEMENT NEW 
IDEAS?
NOW THAT THE TALENT IS THERE, 
IT'S A CASE OF MAYBE GETTING A 
LITTLE DIFFERENT APPROACH.
I MEAN, EVERYBODY SAYING DID HE 
PLAY THE RIGHT PLAYERS, DID HE 
HAVE THE RIGHT APPROACH?
HEY, IT'S TIME FOR A NEW 
APPROACH. 
>> THE NEW APPROACH COULD BE-- 
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S A COACH THAT 
HAS BEEN HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS, 
THAT'S A LONG TIME IN THE WORLD 
OF SOCCER.
SO WE'LL MENTION THAT, DO WE 
NEED FRESH AIR HERE, BUT I DO 
THINK THAT AT THIS POINT I 
DON'T SEE ANOTHER CANDIDATE, 
AMERICAN CANDIDATE THAT'S 
READY.
PERHAPS ZIGGY SCHMIDT BUT 
PEOPLE WILL ASK, SO IF IT'S A 
FOREIGN COACH, THE DECISION 
SHOULD BE MADE VERY QUICKLY, 
PERHAPS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE 
COACHES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS 
AFTER THIS WORLD CUP, SO THERE 
WILL BE PLENTY OF THEM 
AVAILABLE.
>> GIVE YOU ONE NAME--
>> KIROSH WAS HERE BEFORE.
HE COACHED IN MLS, WITH THE 
SO-CALLED METRO STARS, NOW THE 
RED BULL, SO HE HAS EXPERIENCE 
OF THIS COUNTRY, PLUS THE FACT 
THAT HE BROUGHT ON YOUNG 
PLAYERS.
HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB WITH 
PORTUGAL, HE BROUGHT ON UNDER 
21 PLAYERS, HE BROUGHT ON UNDER 
23 PLAYERS, WON TWO WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS.
HE KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE YOUNG 
PLAYERS, THAT TO ME IS THE KEY. 
>> LET'S HEAR FROM ARENA NOW, 
HIS COMMENTS AFTER THE 2-1 
LOSS, MAINLY CENTERING ON THE 
CONTROVERSIAL CALL AT THE END 
OF THE FIRST HALF.
>> WE WORKED REAL HARD TO GET 
BACK INTO THE GAME, AND VERY 
DISAPPOINTED ON THE JUDGMENT OF 
OUR REFEREE FOR THAT PENALTY 
KICK CALL, AND PUTTING OUR TEAM 
BEHIND AT HALF AND HAVING TO 
CHASE THE GAME FOR THE SECOND 
HALF, AND I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO 
HAVE COME OUT, HALFTIME MEETING 
AND HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY 
MAKE IT A GAME AND WIN THAT 
GAME, BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE 
IN GOOD POSITION AT THE TIME. 
THE CALL WAS A BIG CALL IN THE 
GAME. 
HAVING SAID THAT, WE COULD HAVE 
BEEN BETTER WITH OUR 
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SECOND 
HALF TO GET SOME GOALS- 
>> AND YOU WERE FORCED TO 
CHANGE CLAUDIO REYNA AT 
HALFTIME. 
HOW IS HE AND HOW DID THAT 
AFFECT THE SHAPE OF THE TEAM? 
>> DIDN'T AFFECT OUR SHAPE. 
DID A GOOD JOB COMING IN FOR 
CLAUDIO, INJURIES ARE PART OF 
THE GAME. 
>> AND FINALLY, YOU WENT FOR 
IT, YOU BROUGHT ON JOHNSON THE 
ATTACK, THOUGHT MAYBE HE 
WOULD-- 
>> YEAH, AT THAT POINT, 
OBVIOUSLY, GHANA IN THE SECOND 
HALF WAS VERY INTENT ON SETTING 
THE TEAM BACK.
THE CALL FOR THE PENALTY IS BIG 
SO THEY CAN HIT BACK AND HIT 
THEIR SPOTS TO COUNTER, AND 
THEY DID THAT.
>> SO BRUCE ARENA'S TEAM IS 
DONE FOR THE WORLD CUP AND AS 
YOU GUYS JUST DISCUSSED, HIS 
FUTURE VERY MUCH IN DOUBT.
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'LL CHECK IN 
WITH THE -- FOR THE PERSPECTIVE 
ON THE WORLD CUP STUDIO CREW 
JOINING US WITH THEIR THOUGHTS. 
>> WHEN THE UNITED STATES LOOKS 
BACK ON ITS OPPORTUNITY IN THIS 
WORLD CUP, IT MIGHT BE LOOKING 
AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY LOST, 
NOT ONLY FROM THE GRAND 
PERSPECTIVE OF BUILDING ON THE 
QUARTERFINAL RUN IN 2002, BUT 
PARTICULARLY IN THIS GAME, AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE OUT, JUST 
COULDN'T MAKE THE PLAYS THEY 
NEEDED TO, JULIE. 
>> THAT WILL BE THE BIG 
QUESTION. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME ON, WERE 
WATCHING THIS WORLD CUP.
ARE THE UNITED STATES GOOD 
ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY GET INTO THE 
SECOND ROUND? 
DO THEY HAVE THE PLAYERS. 
I THINK THEY DO, THE PROBLEM IS 
THAT WE ONLY SAW THE BIG NAMES 
STEP UP IN SPURTS.
YOU SEE BRIAN MCBRIDE 
OCCASIONALLY. 
YOU SEE DAMARCUS BEASLEY 
OCCASIONALLY. 
YOU DON'T SEE THEM CONSISTENTLY 
ENOUGH AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF 
THE FIRST ROUND UNLESS YOUR 
PLAYERS, WHO HAVE THE POTENTIAL 
TO BE GOOD, SHOW UP, AND 
LANGDON DONOVAN, NONEXISTENT, 
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE FOR THE 
UNITED STATES, WHEN YOU HAVE A 
PLAYMAKER THAT JUST DOESN'T 
COME. 
>> I'LL DEFEND THE PLAYERS. 
I'M GOING TO GO AFTER THE 
COACH.
I THINK THAT THE MANAGERIAL 
DECISIONS MADE BY BRUCE ARENA 
PUT THESE GUYS IN A BAD SPOT. 
I DON'T THINK THEY EVER FIGURED 
OUT THAT IN A WORLD CUP, THE 
BALL DOES TURN OVER.
THEY WORKED OUT SO HARD ON 
FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO 
DEFENSIVELY THAT ONCE THEY GOT 
THE BALL, THEY FORGOT 
COMPLETELY WHAT THEY WERE 
SUPPOSED TO DO. 
IN WOURLS IT OPENS UP AND 
THAT'S THE WAY -- IN WORLD CUPS 
IT OPENS UP AND THAT'S THE WAY 
THE GAME IS PLAYED. 
THE UNITED STATES, BRUCE ARENA 
WAS THE PROBLEM AND IT'S A HECK 
OF A LOT EASIER TO REPLACE ONE 
GUY THAN IT IS THE OTHERS.
>> YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO MAKE 
A CHANGE? 
>> I BELIEVE IF THAT'S THE KIND 
OF TEAM WE'RE GOING TO THROW 
OUT THERE, WE'RE BETTER THAN 
THAT, TIME TO GET RID OF THE 
COACH.
>> THE WORLD CUP IS UP FOR 
BRUCE ARENA AND THE UNITED 
STATES THIS YEAR. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
GUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WANT TO BRING UP THE TOPIC HERE 
ABOUT PREPARATION FOR 
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION WHEN 
IT COMES TO U.S.A. PLAYERS. 
SHOULD THE U.S.A. NOW HAVE MORE 
PLAYERS PLAYING 
INTERNATIONALLY?
IS THE MLS FOR A LOT OF THESE 
GUYS ENOUGH OF A PREPARATION? 
>> W HERE'S THE BIGGEST 
DIFFERENCE. 
IT'S TRAINING DAY IN AND DAY 
OUT, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T 
GET IN MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER. 
THESE GUYS NEED TO LEARN TO BE 
PROS, PLAY FOR YOUR POSITION 
EVERY DAY.
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE BIG GAMES 
OR THE CHAMPIONSHIPS, THE 
SEMIFINALS, THOSE ARE GREAT BUT 
I THINK TO REALLY IMPROVE, IT'S 
ALL ABOUT COMPETING EVERY DAY 
AT THE TOP FLIGHT LEVEL.
MAYBE AS MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER IN 
A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT CERTAINLY 
MORE PLAYERS NEED TO PUT 
THEMSELVES IN THAT ENVIRONMENT 
TO IMPROVE. 
>> I THINK THE CASE IS IF 
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH, THE BIG 
TEAMS WILL COME LOOKING FOR 
YOU, SO YOU HAVE TO BECOME GOOD 
ENOUGH TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
OR TO BE SIGNED BY SOMEBODY 
ELSE. 
YOU KNOW,IBILITY TAKE EXCUSES 
THAT THE PLAYERS ON THE FIELD 
HAD ENOUGH TO DO IT AND I DON'T 
THINK THIS IS A BIG KNOCK ON 
U.S. SOCCER.
THE FACT THAT THE U.S. GOT TO 
THE WORLD CUP FINALS WAS GREAT 
AND THEY DIDN'T WEAR THERE, THE 
OLYMPICS THEY DIDN'T WIN THERE, 
SOCCER -- HOCKEY AND 
BASKETBALL, DIDN'T WIN THERE. 
SO CERTAINLY SOCCER, JUST GET 
YOUNG PLAYERS, IMPROVE THEM.
>> THE CORE OF THIS TEAM SHOULD 
PLAY ABROAD BUT THE BIG THING 
IS EXPECTATIONS.
IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR 
US TO THINK GIVEN THAT GROUP 
BEFORE THE WORLD CUP THAT WE 
WERE GOING TO EASILY GO THROUGH 
IT AND WE CHEER A LITTLE BIT, 
HAD OUR POMPOMS OUT AND WHAT 
HAPPENED WAS REALITY, DID IT 
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY?
NO, WE COULD HAVE PULLED 
ANOTHER ONE PERHAPS TODAY IF IT 
WASN'T FOR THAT CALL BUT WE 
STILL DIDN'T PLAY WELL WHEN IT 
MATTERED AND THE FIRST GAME WAS 
REALLY THE KILLER, AND THAT'S 
THE BOTTOM LINE.
YOU LOSE THAT FIRST GAME, AND 
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
OUT.
>> REALITY BITES. 
ANYBODY WHO IS WATCHING 
ESPNEWS, I KEEP TELLING PEOPLE 
HOW GOOD GHANA WERE.
GHANA ARE A VERY GOOD TEAM. 
THIS WAS A VERY WELL COACHED 
SIDE, THAT IS A SIDE THAT HAS 
MIKE, PROBABLY THE BEST HOLDING 
MIDFIELDER IN THIS, AND NOT 
MANY TEAMS CAN SAY HE THEY HAVE 
GOOD PLAYERS LIKE THAT. 
APPIAH WAS A GOOD PLAYER. 
TO WATCH THEM OFF WAS VERY 
FOOLISH IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT 
I THINK THE U.S. DID FINE.
>> I THINK THE ONE THING WE 
LEARNED IS THIS, IT'S NOT HOW 
YOU FINISH, IT'S HOW YOU START 
AND THE U.S. NEVER RECOVERED 
FROM THE DEVASTATING DEFEAT TO 
THE CZECH REPUBLIC. 
>> GUYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
JOINING US. 
YOU'RE WATCHING ON ESPN, WORLD 
CUP SPECIAL IS COMING UP. 
IF YOU'RE WATCHING ESPNEWS, WE 
CONTINUE.

I'M NOT GOING TO BLAME HIM 
BECAUSE THIS WAS A TOUGH ONE HE 
IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE HERE MANY 
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME COVERAGE 
HERE AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS 
NOT MUCH HE COULD HAVE DONE 
>> I THINK THEY TRUST HIM SO 
MUCH, THEY LEFT HIM WITHOUT ANY 
SUPPORT AND PAID PRICE. 
BACK TO THE CZECH REPUBLIC. 
>> IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO STEP
UP. 
JUST CAME OUT AND GOT ON. 
BIG HERO. 
HE NODS IT HOME. 
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT TEAM U.S.A.
WANTED AS ITALY DOING WHAT IT 
HAD TO DO, BUT WOULD TEAM U.S.A.
DO WHAT IT HAD TO DO IN WE, 
LOOKING GOOD HERE. 
I DIDN'T WORK ON OFTEN WITH YOU 
THIS IS PROBABLY BEV SEQUENCE 
DONOVAN RUNNING OFF McbRIDE. 
THE OFFENSE STRUGGLING AND TO 
MARCUS
MARCUS BEAZLEY. 
EARLY BALL ACROSS, GREAT FINISH 
BY DEMPSEY. 
>> VERY, VERY SIMILAR ONE. 
THIS ONE PERHAPS CLOSER, BUT 
WHAT A GOAL, BEST U.S. PLAYER IN
THE TOURNAMENT. 
HE CAME INTO THE TOURNAMENT AND 
PLAYED, DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT 
ANYTHING. 
AND THIS IS JUST A TREMENDOUS 
FINISH HERE. 
YOU CAN SEE HIM SIZE UP THE 
SITUATION. 
>> CZECH REPUBLIC HAS BEEN 
TOSSED AFTER THIS. 
HE ALREADY HAS A YELLOW CARD AND
IS NOW TOSSED, CZECH REPUBLIC IS
DOWN REST OF MATCH. 
GUCCI ON YAYWU. 
>> BUT NOT ONCE BUT TWICE 
FAILED TO CLEAR. 
HE ONES HEADER AND TILL GETS 
CALLED. 
THEY CONTINUE TO PUT THEMSELVES 
IN A BAD SITUATION. 
SETS IT UP FOR STEVENS, ABLE TO 
CONVERTMENT HE DWS TOUGH ON THE 
OPPOSITE SIDE. 
>> NOTHING CONTROVERSIAL FOR 
ME. 
JUST A BAD CALL MADE BY ONE OF 
THE BEST REFEREES THERE WORLD. 
JUST NO REASON TO CALL THAT, 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT SITUATION IS,
BUT THIS IS JUST BAD. 
2-1 DOWN AT THE HALF. 
ITALY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
WITH THE CZECHES TRYING TO PULL 
EVEN HERE. 
A REALLY GOOD GAME. 
BOUNCING AROUND, EVERYTHING BUT 
THE THE FINISH. 
WASN'T GOING TO DO IT TODAY. 
>> SECOND HALF, BRIAN McbRIDE. 
CHECK IT OUT AGAIN. 
>> THOSE ARE SITUATIONS YOU 
HAVE TO PUTT AWAY IN A TIGHT 
GAME. 
HE MAKES A GREAT EFFORT BUT A 
LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY AND HIS WOOD 
WORK. 
>> THE HEADER AND HE RISES 
PERFECTLY TO IT. 
HE JUST NEEDS TO GET IT DOWN A 
LITTLE BIT. 
I WAS THERE AND HE JUST KNOCKED 
IT OVER TOP. 
VINDICATION BUT IT DIDN'T COME. 
>> TEAM U.S.A. ARE UNABLE TO 
PUT A GOAL ON BOARD. 
MEANTIME 1-0 ITALY. 
ALL HE DOES IS SCORE GOALS. 
SELLS IT LIKE HE IS TO PASS I 
AND I TIANS, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE 
WON TWO VERY DWOOD GAMES IN THIS
GROUP AGAINST A TOUGH GUY. 
ITALY DOING...
>> WHY DO YOU THINK I PICKED UP 
WINNERS? 
AND THEY HAD ALL MOTIVATION. 
THEY DID NO WANT TO SEE BRAZIL 
IN THE ROUND 
>> ALL OVER FOR TEAM U.S.A. 
THREE SHOTS ON GOAL TOTAL IN 
THEIR THREE GAME TORN AM. 
THEY GO DOWN-ONE. 
GHANA AND ITALY MOVE ON. 
TEAM U.S.A. AND CZECH REPUBLIC 
GO HOME. 
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS FOR 
GAME? 
>> STRANGE GAME. 
WE HI POST. 
PEE HAVE A FEW CHANCES. 
I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY 
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO ON IN 
THIS GAME THAT WE STUCK 
TOGETHER, TRIED TO PUSH FORWARD,
IF WE HAD JUST GOTTEN THAT 
SECOND GOAL, WITH YOU NO WOULD 
HAVE COULD HAVE OR SHOULD HAVES.
>> WHAT DID YOU CALL THAT GOAL?
>> I DOAN KNOW. 
I RARELY EVER SEE SOMETHING LIKE
THAT CALLED. 
THEY WRN EVEN USING THEIR ARMS, 
SO HALFTIME AND MOMENTUM AND, 
YOU KNOW, STILL CAME OUT AND 
PRESS FORWARD. 
AND CREATED A LO OF CHANCES AND 
ICE JUST UNFORTUNATE. 
>> WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM 
THIS EXPERIENCE? 
>> WE, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN 
GREAT. 
I'VE ENJOYED IT. 
>> TEAM U.S.A. LOSING TO GHANA 
TWO HAD ONE OUT OF WORLD CUP. 
QUESTION, WHERE DOES TEAM U.S.A.
GO FROM HERE? 
>> I THINK THERE IS NO DISGRACE
IN BEING IN THE WORLD CUP TIMES 
AND LOSING. 
THERE HAS TO BE A WINNER AND 
LOSER ALL TIME. 
I THINK THE EXPECTATIONS WERE 
TOO HIGH BECAUSE OF OF WHAT THE 
U.S. ACHIEVED IN LAST WORLD CUP.
I THINK IT'S BACK TO DRAWING 
BOARD. 
GET A FEW MORE PLAYERS. 
THEY NEED SOMEBODY IN MID-FIELD 
THAT CAN CREATE THANK YOU SO 
MUCH AND MOVE OF ALL, THEY HAVE 
TO DEVELOP A STRIKER, SOMEBODY 
WHO CAN PUTT BALL IN BACK OF 
NET. 
THAT'S SOMETHING U.S. HAS NOT 
DONE VERY WELL MANY 
>> EVERYBODY THOUGHT WE HAD 
ARRIVED BUT WE HAVE NOT. 
THERE ARE A LO OF COUNTRIES 
TRYING TO DO SAME THING AND 
CAN'T DO I. 
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT WE 
ARE GETTING BETTER 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> THE LEAGUE IS NOT GOING TO 
GO AWAY. 
U.S. SOCCER IS STILL ASCENDING 
TO HIGHER HEIGHTS BUT THE 
QUESTION WILL BE HOW WILL THEY 
RESPOND INMATERIALLY? 
WILL THEY CONTINUE THE GREAT 
DIRECTION THEY'RE IN? 
TRY TO SHAKE THINGS UP, OVERTURN
THE APPLE CART? 
WE SHOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. 
ALMOST00 TEAMS START THE 
PROCESS. 
ONLY 32 GET TO GERMANY. 
YOU THINK ABOUT THE CZECH PSH 
ALSO GOING HOME. 
THERE ARE SOME GOOD TEAMS NOT 
GOING ON. 
U.S. SOCCER STILL VERY MUCH IS 
GOING FORWARD. 
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HEAR 
FROM BRUCE ARENA.

FROM
12
YARDS.
HE SCORES.
2-1, GHANA.
CAN 
>> WHAT WAS YOUR OPINION? 
>> WELL, I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE
IT WASN'T A GOOD CALL. 
TO HAVE THAT CALL IN THE 47th 
MINUTE AFTER OUR TEAMWORKED SO 
HARD TO GET BACK IN THE GAME IS 
DIFFICULT MUCH I FEEL SORRY FOR 
OUR TEAM. 
WE PLAYED A VERY GOOD GAME 
CERTAINLY AT FOUGHT IN THE 
SECOND HALF FOR NOT DOING BETTER
WITH THE TACTIC PLAY AND NOT 
GETTING GOAL, BUT TO BE IN A 
POSITION TO HAVE TO CHASE THE 
GAME ON THAT CALL WAS KIND OF 
REMARKABLE IN A GAME AT THIS 
LEVEL. 
IT'S A BIG CALL, BY THE WAY, IF 
YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT. 
THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE GAME.
WE HAD CONTROL OF THE GAME. 
WE GO INTO HALFTIME DOWN A GOAL.
BUT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. 
THEY HAPPEN A LOT TO OUR TEAM, 
WITHOUT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN AND 
WE HAD CHANCES IN THE SECOND 
HALF BUT WE'LL PUT IN AN AWKWARD
POSITION TO HAVE TO GO AGAINST 
THE TEAM. 
IT IS DISAPPOINTING. 
KNOWING THAT A WIN GETS US INTO 
THE NEXT ROUND WOULD HAVE BEEN 
GREAT, AND IT'S TOUGH. 
IT'S A TOUGH ONE TO DEAL WITH. 
>> DID YOU MANAGE TO HAVE ANY 
CONVERSATION WITH THE REFEREE 
ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS? 
>> SHOOK HIS HAND AFTERWARDS; 
YOU KNOW. 
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANY REFEREE 
SAY THEY MADE A BAD CALL? 
>> YEAH, HE'S A MAN THAT HAS 
DONE A LOT OF GOOD MATCHES. 
HE IS OBVIOUSLY A QUALITY 
REFEREE, AND, YOU KNOW, REFEREES
HAVE GOOD DAYS, AND REFEREES 
HAVE BAD DAYS. 
PLAYERS HAVE GOOD DAYS AND BAD 
DAYS. 
SAME WITH COACHES. 
>> MUCH OF HIS COMMENTS 
DIRECTED AT THAT PENALTY CALL 
STOPPED TIME THE FIRST HALF. 
IS THAT THE ENTIRE STORY? 
>> YOU NEED A BREAK, SOME 
BALANCE AND LOVE IF YOU ARE 
GOING TO ADVANCE AND WHAT 
HAPPENED THEY DID NOT PUT 
THEMSELVES IN A POSITION TO 
CREATE THEIR OWN LUCK. 
THEY LEFT IT TO DR. MARCUS MIRK.
THAT'S THE SOFT SOFTEST. 
IF HE LOVES THAT BALLBALL-- LOBS 
THAT BALL INTO THE SECOND TIER 
THE STADIUM, I DON'T THINK WE 
ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. 
>> OBVIOUSLY THIS GAME BUT I 
THINK WE LEFT IT LATE AND WE 
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE FIRST GAME AGAINST THE 
CZECH REPUBLIC BECAUSE THAT'S 
WHERE WE LOST GAME. 
AND TO LOSE IT... WE ALL KNEW 
HOW IMPORTANT HE IS TO THE TEAM.
TO GIVE UP A GOAL IN THE FOURTH 
OR FIFTH MINUTE, WE DIDN'T 
WORRY. 
I THINK THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM 
BECAUSE EVEN IF HE LOST THAT 
GAME 1-NIL, ITALY LOOKS 
DIFFERENT. 
MAYBE WE HAVE TO DO MORE. 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT 
WAS A TOUGH GROUP 
>> IT WAS A VERY TOUGH GROUP 
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GIVE SOME 
CREDIT. 
WE HAVEN'T GIVEN CREDIT TO THE 
MAN WHO STEPPED UP AND TOOK THE 
PENALTY KICK. 
P NO QUESTION ABOUT IT HE TOOK 
IT WELL. 
THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE THIS 
THIS AND A LOT OF PRESS ARE ON 
BRUCE ARENA. 
BRUCE SAID COACHES AND REFEREE 
DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD DAY. 
THE PENALTY KICK WAS THE STORY 
BUT NOT WHOLE REASON. 
>> AS IT IS, CONTROVERSY OR 
NOT, OVER FOR TEAM U.S.A. 
THEY HAD TO WIN TODAY. 
THEY CANNOT AS THEY GO DOWN IN 
GHANA 2-1. 
P MORE DISCUSSION AHEAD AS TEAM 
U.S.A. AND GHANA FINISH UPBURY 
LOSING BY ONE. 
STAY US

>> HI EVERYONEMENT BILL PIDTO 
WITH BREAKING NEWS. 
LARRY BROWN HAS BEEN FIRED AS 
HEAD COACH OF THE NEW YORK 
KNICKS AFTER AN IS AS TRUSS 
ONE-YEAR STINT WITH A RECORD OF 
23-59, WORST RECORD FOR BROWN. 
ISAIAH THOMAS WILL ASSUME 
COACHING DUTIES. 
HE HAD ONE YEAR LEFT ON HIS 
CONTRACT AT THERE ARE 40000000 
WILL WE DON'T HAVE THE TERMS THE
BUYOUT. 
HE CAME TO THE THE KNICKS ONE 
YEAR AFTER LEADING THE PISTONS 
TO THE FINALS. 
MANAGEMENT BECAME UPSET AFTER 
BROWN CRITICIZED HIS PLAYERS IN 
PUBLIC. 
WE ARE NOW JOINED ON THE PHONE 
BY KNICKS BEAT WRITER RICK 
BURMAN WHO JOINS US VIA THE ESPN
MOBILE. 
LARRY BROWN OWED IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD OF $40000000. 
HOW IS MONEY ISSUE RESOLVED? 
>> IT IS GOING TO BE 
COMPLICATED. 
I REALLY CAN'T GET INTO 
SPECIFICS RIGHT NOW. 
BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A DISPUTE.
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY UGLY AND 
HE WAS FIRED BUT IT IS GOING TO 
BE A DISPUTE ON HOW MUCH MONEY 
LARRY GETS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN 
DETERMINED YET. 
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING THE KNICKS
WENT AHEAD AND FIRED HARD-LINE 
WITHOUT HAVING A MONETARY 
SETTLEMENT. 
BUT IF THEY ARE CONTRACTUALLY 
OBLIGATED TO PAY HIM IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THAT $40 MILLION
FIGURE, HOW CAN THEY GET AWAY 
WITH PAYING HIM LEFT LESS IN 
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO 
SPECIFICATIONS BUT THAT'S WHERE 
THE DISPUTE WILL COME INTO PLAY.
THE KNICKS OBVIOUSLY VERY UPSET 
WITH LARRY'S PERFORMANCE THIS 
YEAR, AND THEY FEEL DIFFERENTLY 
P LARRY ON THAT ISSUE. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE TIMELINE 
HERE? 
WE KNOW WE SAW LARRY BROWN AT 
THE PRE-DRAFT WORKOUTS FOR THE 
ROOKIES WHEN THE SITUATION LOOK 
LIKE IT WAS GOING TO WORK OUT 
BUT HE CONTINUED TO GO ALONG AS 
COACH EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS GOING TO BE DONE IN THAT 
POSITION. 
WHY IS TODAY THE DAY THE KNICKS 
MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT? 
>> TODAY WAS THE LAST DAY OF 
THE PRE-DRAFT WORKOUTS. 
LARRY DRAFTED MORE THAN A DODDS 
OF THEM AND TODAY WAS THE LAST 
DAY. 
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST TIMING.
THEY HAD LARRY DO THE WORKOUTS. 
HE'S GREAT WITH KIDS IN TERMS OF
OF GIVING THEM PREVAST WORKOUTS.
HE LAEL WORKS THEM WELL AND I 
THINK OWEN WANTED LARRY TO 
SUFFER A LITTLE BIT. 
VERY BITTER AT WHAT LARRY DID 
THIS SEASON AND THEY MET FOR AN 
HOUR. 
I'M TOLD THAT DON WENT THIS THE 
MEETING WITH AN OPEN MIND, WAN 
TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO CHANGE.
BUT THEY DID NOT THINK THE THE 
MEETING WENT WELL AT ALL. 
THEY PROBABLY MET AT 8:00 OR 
EIGHT CLR 15 IN THE MORNING AND 
THEY CANNOT REACH AN EQUITABLE 
DECISION SO FAR. 
THIS IS DAY 40 SINCE WE WROTE 
THE STORY. 
>> MARC, IF YOU'LL HANG ON, 
WE'LL READ A STATEMENT RELEASED 
BY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE
KNICKS, JAMES DOLAN. 
HE SAID: WHAT WAS THE SINGLE 
BIGGEST ISSUE THAT CREATED THIS 
RIP? 
>> THERE WERE A NUMBER THEM. 
LARRY CAN BE UNBEARABLE WHEN I 
COMES TO WANTING ROSTER MOVES 
AND HE SO MANY FRIENDS ALONG 
LEAD, TALKING TO THEM ABOUT 
TRADES, AND IT SORT OF EWE 
SEARCHING ISAIAH'S 
RESPONSIBILITIES. 
AND THEY COULDN'T WORK THAT WAY 
ANYMORE. 
P LARRY WANTS TO BE COACH AND 
THE G.M. 
HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT TITLE IN 
PHILADELPHIA BUT THAT'S WHAT HE 
REALLY WAS. 
AND AS MANY PEOPLE PREDICTED, 
WHEN I GET HIRED, ISAIAH WANTS A
NOT ARE CONTROL. 
IT IS A TERRIBLE MARRIAGE FROM 
GIVENING UNDERSTOOD SO MANY 
PEOPLE PREDICTED I ANYWAY. 
>> SO NOW INTO STEPS OF ISAIAH 
THOMAS AS COACH AND RETAIN IS 
HOSTAGE. 
HE IS MAN CONSIDERED TO HAVE 
WITH THIS TEAM. 
HOW IS HE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
COACH THEM? 
>> WELL, I THINK THE NISHGS 
WANT TO RUN SHOW. 
I EYE-- I SIGHIA BELIEVES IN 
THIS ROSTER. 
HE BROUGHT ALL THESE GUYS INTO 
NEW YORK. 
LARRY NEVER BELIEVED IN THIS 
ROSSERMENT ISAIAH IS GOING TO 
COME IN WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
ATTITUDE. 
HE WON'T BE RIPPING PLAYERS IN 
THE PRET, AND THAT IN ITSELF IT 
AS A VERY TALENTED ROSTER THEY 
BELIEVE THAT WITH A PLAYOFF GAME
AND WITH A WEATHER CLIMATE, 
BETTER TEAM AROUND, THEY THINK 
WITH MINIMAL CHANGES ISAIAH 
THEY'RE MISERABLE. 
THEY HAVER REASON AND EVERY 
RIGHT TO CAN HIM. 
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE ISAIAH 
CANNED NOW BUTT WILL UNTIL YOU 
GET A COACH THAT HE BELIEVES IS 
RIGHT PERSON FOR ROSTER, YOU 
KNOW, AS
MICHAEL JORDAN AND LARRY HOOKING
UP. 
THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS AND 
THEY HAVE THE UNC TIES. 
LARRY HAD A LOT OF TIES TO 
CHARLOTTE, HIS MOTHER WHO IS 101
LIVES THERE. 
HIS TWO DAUGHTERS FROM HIS FIRST
MARRIAGE LIVE THERE IT MIGHT BE 
A NICE FIT BUT LARRY IS MORE 
CONCERNED WITH THE MONETARY SET 
LEM RIGHT NOW. 
>> MARC BERMAN FROM THE "NEW 
YORK POST," THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MORE ON THE LARRY BROWN 
SITUATION ON IN THE AFTERNOON. 
IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL CONTINUE 
TO TALK ABOUT WORLD CUP SOCCER. 
TEAM U.S.A. IS DONE.

WHAT A GOAL, BEST U.S. PLAYER IN
THE TOURNAMENT. 
HE CAME INTO THE TOURNAMENT AND 
PLAYED, DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT 
ANYTHING. 
AND THIS IS JUST A TREMENDOUS 
FINISH HERE. 
YOU CAN SEE HIM SIZE UP THE 
SITUATION. 
HE PLAYED THE BALL EXACTLY WHERE
DEMPSEY NEEDED ITMENT AND BACK 
AT THE CZECH REPUBLIC. 
. 
HE HAS BEEN TOSSEDMENT

TOSSED AFTER THIS. 
HE ALREADY HAS A YELLOW CARD AND

JUST A BAD CALL MADE BY ONE OF 
THE BEST REFEREES THERE WORLD. 
JUST NO REASON TO CALL THAT, 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT SITUATION IS,
BUT THIS IS JUST BAD. 
2-1 DOWN AT THE HALF. 
ITALY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
WITH THE CZECHES TRYING TO PULL 
EVEN HERE. 
A REALLY GOOD GAME. 
BOUNCING AROUND, EVERYTHING BUT 
HAVE TO PUT AWAY IN A TIGHT 
GAME. 
HE MAKES A GREAT EFFORT BUT A 
LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY AND HIS WOOD 
LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY AND HITS THE 
WOOD WORK. 
>> THE HEADER AND HE RISES 
PERFECTLY TO IT. 
HE JUST NEEDS TO GET IT DOWN A 
LITTLE BIT. 
I WAS THERE AND HE JUST KNOCKED 
IT OVER TOP. 
VINDICATION BUT IT DIDN'T COME. 
>> TEAM U.S.A. ARE UNABLE TO 
PUT A GOAL ON THE BOARD. 
MEANTIME 1-0 ITALY. 
ALL HE DOES IS SCORE GOALS. 
SELLS IT LIKE HE IS TO PASS I 
AND I TIANS, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE 
WON TWO VERY DWOOD GAMES IN THIS
GROUP AGAINST A TOUGH GUY. 
ITALY DOING...
>> WHY DO YOU THINK I PICKED UP 
WINNERS? 
AND THEY HAD ALL MOTIVATION. 
THEY DID NO WANT TO SEE BRAZIL 
IN THE ROUND 
>> ALL OVER FOR TEAM U.S.A. 
ITALY DID IT. 
TEAM U.S.A. DID NOT.

TEAM U.S.A. AND CZECH REPUBLIC

>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS FOR 
BRIAN McbRIDE WITH SHELLY SMITH.
>> Reporter: WHAT ARE YOUR SHOTS
ON THIS GAME? 
>> STRANGE GAME. 
WE HAVE A FEW CHANCES. 
I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY 
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO ON IN 
THIS GAME THAT WE STUCK 
TOGETHER, TRIED TO PUSH FORWARD,
IF WE HAD JUST GOTTEN THAT 
SECOND GOAL, WITH YOU NO WOULD 
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
>> WHAT DID YOU CALL THAT GOAL?

THEY WEREN'T EVEN USING THEIR 
ARMS, SO HALFTIME AND MOMENTUM 
IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE. 
>> WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM 
THIS EXPERIENCE? 
>> WE, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN 
GREAT. 
I'VE ENJOYED IT. 
OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL FOR BRIAN 
McbRIDE. 
>> TEAM U.S.A. LOSING TO GHANA 
TWO HAD ONE OUT OF WORLD CUP. 
QUESTION, WHERE DOES TEAM U.S.A.
GO FROM HERE? 
>> I THINK THERE IS NO DISGRACE
IN BEING IN THE WORLD CUP TIMES 
AND LOSING. 
THERE HAS TO BE A WINNER AND 
LOSER ALL TIME. 
I THINK THE EXPECTATIONS WERE 
TOO HIGH BECAUSE OF OF WHAT THE 
U.S. ACHIEVED IN LAST WORLD CUP.
I THINK IT'S BACK TO DRAWING 
BOARD. 
GET A FEW MORE PLAYERS. 
MUCH AND MOVE OF ALL, THEY HAVE 
THEY NEED SOMEBODY IN MID-FIELD 
THAT CAN CREATE 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
AND MOST OF ALL, THEY HAVE TO 
DEVELOP A STRIKER, SOMEBODY WHO 
CAN PUTT BALL IN BACK OF NET. 
CAN PUT THE BALL IN BACK OF NET.
THAT'S SOMETHING U.S. HAS NOT 
DONE VERY WELL MANY 
DONE VERY WELL MANY. 
>> EVERYBODY THOUGHT WE HAD 
ARRIVED BUT WE HAVE NOT. 
THERE ARE A LO OF COUNTRIES 
THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES 
TRYING TO DO SAME THING AND

- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.
FROM
12
YARDS.
AVE. A PENALTY IN THE BRONX, A 
PENALTY SHOT FOR GOON A1-1. 
WORLD CUP RUN
g
>> WHAT WAS YOUR OPINION? 
>> WELL, I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE
IT WASN'T A GOOD CALL. 
TO HAVE THAT CALL IN THE 47th 
MINUTE AFTER OUR TEAMWORKED SO 
HARD TO GET BACK IN THE GAME IS 
DIFFICULT MUCH I FEEL SORRY FOR 
OUR TEAM. 
WE PLAYED A VERY GOOD GAME 
CERTAINLY AT FOUGHT IN THE 
SECOND HALF FOR NOT DOING BETTER
WITH THE TACTIC PLAY AND NOT 
GETTING GOAL, BUT TO BE IN A 
POSITION TO HAVE TO CHASE THE 
GAME ON THAT CALL WAS KIND OF 
REMARKABLE IN A GAME AT THIS 
LEVEL. 
IT'S A BIG CALL, BY THE WAY, IF 
YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT. 
THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE GAME.
WE HAD CONTROL OF THE GAME. 
WE GO INTO HALFTIME DOWN A GOAL.
BUT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. 
THEY HAPPEN A LOT TO OUR TEAM, 
WITHOUT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN AND 
WE HAD CHANCES IN THE SECOND 
HALF BUT WE'LL PUT IN AN AWKWARD
HALF BUT WE'RE PUT IN AN AWKWARD
POSITION TO HAVE TO GO AGAINST 
THE TEAM. 
IRI THINK KNOWING THAT A WIN 
GETS US INTO THE NEXT ROUND 
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. 
AND IT'S TOUGH, A TOUGH ONE TO 
DEAL WITH. 
>> DID YOU MANAGE TO HAVE ANY 
CONVERSATION WITH THE REFEREE 
ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS? 
>> SHOOK HIS HAND AFTERWARDS; 
YOU KNOW. 
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANY REFEREE 
SAY THEY MADE A BAD CALL? 
>> YEAH, HE'S A MAN THAT HAS 
DONE A LOT OF GOOD MATCHES. 
HE IS OBVIOUSLY A QUALITY 
REFEREE, AND, YOU KNOW, REFEREES
HAVE GOOD DAYS, AND REFEREES 
HAVE BAD DAYS. 
PLAYERS HAVE GOOD DAYS AND BAD 
DAYS. 
SAME WITH COACHES. 
>> MUCH OF HIS COMMENTS 
DIRECTED AT THAT PENALTY CALL 
STOPPED TIME THE FIRST HALF. 
IS THAT THE ENTIRE STORY? 
>> YOU NEED A BREAK, SOME 
BALANCE AND LOVE IF YOU ARE 
GOING TO ADVANCE AND WHAT 
HAPPENED THEY DID NOT PUT 
THEMSELVES IN A POSITION TO 
CREATE THEIR OWN LUCK. 
THEY LEFT IT TO DR. MARCUS MIRK.
THAT'S THE SOFTEST. 
IF HE LOVES THAT BALL-- LOBS 
THAT BALL INTO THE SECOND TIER 
THE STADIUM, I DON'T THINK WE 
ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. 
>> OBVIOUSLY THIS GAME BUT I 
THINK WE LEFT IT LATE AND WE 
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE FIRST GAME AGAINST THE 
CZECH REPUBLIC BECAUSE THAT'S 
WHERE WE LOST GAME. 
AND TO LOSE IT... WE ALL KNEW 
HOW IMPORTANT HE IS TO THE TEAM.
TO GIVE UP A GOAL IN THE FOURTH 
OR FIFTH MINUTE, WE DIDN'T 
WORRY. 
I THINK THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM 
BECAUSE EVEN IF HE LOST THAT 
GAME 1-NIL, ITALY LOOKS 
DIFFERENT. 
MAYBE WE HAVE TO DO MORE. 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT 
WAS A TOUGH GROUP 
>> IT WAS A VERY TOUGH GROUP 
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GIVE SOME 
CREDIT. 
WE HAVEN'T GIVEN CREDIT TO THE 
MAN WHO STEPPED UP AND TOOK THE 
PENALTY KICK. 
P NO QUESTION ABOUT IT HE TOOK 
IT WELL. 
THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE THIS 
THIS AND A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 
BRUCE ARENA. 
BRUCE SAID COACHES AND REFEREE 
DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD DAY. 
THE PENALTY KICK WAS THE STORY 
BUT NOT THE WHOLE REASON. 
>> AS IT IS, CONTROVERSY OR 
NOT, OVER FOR TEAM U.S.A. 
THEY DID NOT AS THEY GO DOWN IN 
GHANA 2-1. 
MORE DISCUSSION AHEAD AS TEAM 
U.S.A. AND GHANA FINISH UPBURY 
(crowd cheering)
IF YOU'RE WATCHING ESPNEWS, WE 
CONTINUE. 
PLEASE STAY WITH US.
>> HI EVERYONE.
BILL PIDTO WITH BREAKING NEWS. 
LARRY BROWN HAS BEEN FIRED AS 
HEAD COACH OF THE NEW YORK 
KNICKS AFTER A DISASTEROUS 
ONE-YEAR STINT WITH A RECORD OF 
23-59, WORST RECORD FOR BROWN. 
SECOND WORST RECORD FOR BROWN IN
HUSBAND 27 SEASONS AS AN N.B.A. 
COACH. 
ISAIAH THOMAS WILL ASSUME THE 
COACHING DUTIES. 
CONTRACT AT A TOTAL OF 4,000,000
WILL WE DON'T HAVE THE TERMS THE
BUYOUT. 
HE CAME TO THE THE KNICKS ONE 
YEAR AFTER LEADING THE PISTONS 
TO THE FINALS. 
MANAGEMENT BECAME UPSET AFTER 
BROWN CRITICIZED HIS PLAYERS IN 
PUBLIC. 
WE ARE NOW JOINED ON THE PHONE 
BY KNICKS BEAT WRITER RICK 
BERMAN WHO JOINS US VIA THE ESPN
MOBILE. 
LARRY BROWN OWED IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD OF $40,000,000. 
HOW IS MONEY ISSUE RESOLVED? 
>> IT IS GOING TO BE 
COMPLICATED. 
I REALLY CAN'T GET INTO 
SPECIFICS RIGHT NOW. 
BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A DISPUTE.
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY UGLY AND 
HE WAS FIRED BUT IT IS GOING TO 
BE A DISPUTE ON HOW MUCH MONEY 
LARRY GETS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN 
DETERMINED YET. 
WENT AHEAD AND FIRED HIM WITHOUT
HAVING A MONETARY SETTLEMENT. 
BUT IF THEY ARE CONTRACTUALLY 
OBLIGATED TO PAY HIM IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THAT $40 MILLION
WITH PAYING HIM LESS?
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO 
SPECIFICATIONS BUT THAT'S WHERE 
THE DISPUTE WILL COME INTO PLAY.
THE KNICKS OBVIOUSLY VERY UPSET 
WITH LARRY'S PERFORMANCE THIS 
YEAR, AND THEY FEEL DIFFERENTLY 
THAN LARRY ON THAT ISSUE. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE TIMELINE 
HERE? 
WE KNOW WE SAW LARRY BROWN AT 
THE PRE-DRAFT WORKOUTS FOR THE 
ROOKIES WHEN THE SITUATION LOOK 
LIKE IT WAS GOING TO WORK OUT 
BUT HE CONTINUED TO GO ALONG AS 
COACH EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS GOING TO BE DONE IN THAT 
POSITION. 
WHY IS TODAY THE DAY THE KNICKS 
MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT? 
>> TODAY WAS THE LAST DAY OF 
THE PRE-DRAFT WORKOUTS. 
LARRY DRAFTED MORE THAN A DODDS 
OF THEM AND TODAY WAS THE LAST 
DAY. 
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST TIMING.
THEY HAD LARRY DO THE WORKOUTS. 
HE'S GREAT WITH KIDS IN TERMS OF
OF GIVING THEM PREVAST WORKOUTS.
HE LAEL WORKS THEM WELL AND I 
THINK OWEN WANTED LARRY TO 
SUFFER A LITTLE BIT. 
VERY BITTER AT WHAT LARRY DID 
THIS SEASON AND THEY MET FOR AN 
HOUR. 
I'M TOLD THAT DON WENT THIS THE 
MEETING WITH AN OPEN MIND, WAN 
TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO CHANGE.
BUT THEY DID NOT THINK THE THE 
MEETING WENT WELL AT ALL. 
THEY PROBABLY MET AT 8:00 OR 
EIGHT CLR 15 IN THE MORNING AND 
THEY CANNOT REACH AN EQUITABLE 
DECISION TO COME BACK SO FAR. 
THIS IS DAY 40 SINCE WE WROTE 
THE STORY. 
>> MARC, IF YOU'LL HANG ON, 
WE'LL READ A STATEMENT RELEASED 
BY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE
KNICKS, JAMES DOLAN. 
HE SAID: WHAT WAS THE SINGLE 
HE SAID: 
WHAT WAS THE SINGLE BIGGEST 
ISSUE THAT CREATED THIS RIP? 
>> THERE WERE A NUMBER THEM. 
LARRY CAN BE UNBEARABLE WHEN I 
LARRY CAN BE UNBEARABLE WHEN IT 
COMES TO WANTING ROSTER MOVES 
AND HE SO MANY FRIENDS ALONG 
LEAD, TALKING TO THEM ABOUT 
TRADES, AND IT SORT OF EWE 
TRADES, AND IT SORT OF ISAIAH'S 
RESPONSIBILITIES. 
AND THEY COULDN'T WORK THAT WAY 
ANYMORE. 
LARRY WANTS TO BE COACH AND THE 
G.M. 
HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT TITLE IN 
PHILADELPHIA BUT THAT'S WHAT HE 
REALLY WAS. 
AND AS MANY PEOPLE PREDICTED, 
WHEN I GET HIRED, ISAIAH WANTS A
NOT ARE CONTROL. 
IT IS A TERRIBLE MARRIAGE FROM 
GIVENING UNDERSTOOD SO MANY 
PEOPLE PREDICTED I ANYWAY. 
THOMAS AS COACH.
HE IS MAN CONSIDERED TO HAVE 
WITH THIS TEAM. 
HOW IS HE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
>> WELL, I THINK THE KNICKS 
WANT TO RUN SHOW. 
ISSAIAH BELIEVES IN THIS ROSTER.
HE BROUGHT ALL THESE GUYS INTO 
NEW YORK. 
LARRY NEVER BELIEVED IN THIS 
ROSSERMENT ISAIAH IS GOING TO 
ISAIAH IS GOING TO COME IN WITH 
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. 
HE WON'T BE RIPPING PLAYERS IN 
THE PRET, AND THAT IN ITSELF IT 
AS A VERY TALENTED ROSTER THEY 
BELIEVE THAT WITH A PLAYOFF GAME
AND WITH A WEATHER CLIMATE, 
BETTER TEAM AROUND, THEY THINK 
WITH MINIMAL CHANGES ISAIAH 
THEY'RE MISERABLE. 
THEY HAVE EVERY REASON AND EVERY
RIGHT TO CAN HIM. 
CANNED NOW BUT WILL UNTIL YOU 
GET A COACH THAT HE BELIEVES IS 
RIGHT PERSON FOR ROSTER, YOU 
KNOW, AS MICHAEL JORDAN AND 
LARRY HOOKING UP. 
THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS AND 
THEY HAVE THE UNC TIES. 
LARRY HAD A LOT OF TIES TO 
CHARLOTTE, HIS MOTHER WHO IS 101
LIVES THERE. 
HIS TWO DAUGHTERS FROM HIS FIRST
MARRIAGE LIVE THERE IT MIGHT BE 
SETTLEMENT RIGHT NOW. 
THAT'S GOING TO BE BIGGEST THING
ON HIS MIND. 
>> MARC BERMAN FROM THE "NEW 
YORK POST," THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SITUATION ON IN THE AFTERNOON.

PROBABLY BEV SEQUENCE DONOVAN 
RUNNING OFF McbRIDE.

THIS ONE PERHAPS CLOSER, BUT 
WHAT A GOAL, BEST U.S. PLAYER IN
THE TOURNAMENT. 
HE CAME INTO THE TOURNAMENT AND 
PLAYED, DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT 
ANYTHING. 
AND THIS IS JUST A TREMENDOUS 
FINISH HERE. 
YOU CAN SEE HIM SIZE UP THE 
SITUATION. 
>> CZECH REPUBLIC HAS BEEN 
TOSSED AFTER THIS. 
HE ALREADY HAS A YELLOW CARD AND
IS NOW TOSSED, CZECH REPUBLIC IS
DOWN REST OF MATCH. 
GUCCI ON YAYWU. 
>> BUT NOT ONCE BUT TWICE 
FAILED TO CLEAR. 
HE ONES HEADER AND TILL GETS 
CALLED. 
THEY CONTINUE TO PUT THEMSELVES 
IN A BAD SITUATION. 
SETS IT UP FOR STEVENS, ABLE TO 
CONVERTMENT HE DWS TOUGH ON THE 
OPPOSITE SIDE. 
>> NOTHING CONTROVERSIAL FOR 
ME. 
JUST A BAD CALL MADE BY ONE OF 
THE BEST REFEREES THERE WORLD. 
JUST NO REASON TO CALL THAT, 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT SITUATION IS,
BUT THIS IS JUST BAD. 
2-1 DOWN AT THE HALF. 
ITALY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
WITH THE CZECHES TRYING TO PULL 
EVEN HERE. 
A REALLY GOOD GAME. 
BOUNCING AROUND, EVERYTHING BUT 
THE THE FINISH. 
WASN'T GOING TO DO IT TODAY. 
>> SECOND HALF, BRIAN McbRIDE. 
CHECK IT OUT AGAIN. 
>> THOSE ARE SITUATIONS YOU 
HAVE TO PUTT AWAY IN A TIGHT 
GAME. 
HE MAKES A GREAT EFFORT BUT A 
LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY AND HIS WOOD 
WORK. 
>> THE HEADER AND HE RISES 
PERFECTLY TO IT. 
HE JUST NEEDS TO GET IT DOWN A 
LITTLE BIT. 
I WAS THERE AND HE JUST KNOCKED 
IT OVER TOP. 
VINDICATION BUT IT DIDN'T COME. 
>> TEAM U.S.A. ARE UNABLE TO 
PUT A GOAL ON BOARD. 
MEANTIME 1-0 ITALY. 
ALL HE DOES IS SCORE GOALS. 
SELLS IT LIKE HE IS TO PASS I 
AND I TIANS, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE 
WON TWO VERY DWOOD GAMES IN THIS
GROUP AGAINST A TOUGH GUY. 
ITALY DOING...
>> WHY DO YOU THINK I PICKED UP 
WINNERS? 
AND THEY HAD ALL MOTIVATION. 
THEY DID NO WANT TO SEE BRAZIL 
IN THE ROUND 
>> ALL OVER FOR TEAM U.S.A. 
THREE SHOTS ON GOAL TOTAL IN 
THEIR THREE GAME TORN AM. 
THEY GO DOWN-ONE. 
GHANA AND ITALY MOVE ON. 
TEAM U.S.A. AND CZECH REPUBLIC 
GO HOME. 
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS FOR 
GAME? 
>> STRANGE GAME. 
WE HI POST. 
PEE HAVE A FEW CHANCES. 
I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY 
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO ON IN 
THIS GAME THAT WE STUCK 
TOGETHER, TRIED TO PUSH FORWARD,
IF WE HAD JUST GOTTEN THAT 
SECOND GOAL, WITH YOU NO WOULD 
HAVE COULD HAVE OR SHOULD HAVES.
>> WHAT DID YOU CALL THAT GOAL?
>> I DOAN KNOW. 
I RARELY EVER SEE SOMETHING LIKE
THAT CALLED. 
THEY WRN EVEN USING THEIR ARMS, 
SO HALFTIME AND MOMENTUM AND, 
YOU KNOW, STILL CAME OUT AND 
PRESS FORWARD. 
AND CREATED A LO OF CHANCES AND 
ICE JUST UNFORTUNATE. 
>> WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM 
THIS EXPERIENCE? 
>> WE, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN 
GREAT. 
I'VE ENJOYED IT. 
>> TEAM U.S.A. LOSING TO GHANA 
TWO HAD ONE OUT OF WORLD CUP. 
QUESTION, WHERE DOES TEAM U.S.A.
GO FROM HERE? 
>> I THINK THERE IS NO DISGRACE
IN BEING IN THE WORLD CUP TIMES 
AND LOSING. 
THERE HAS TO BE A WINNER AND 
LOSER ALL TIME. 
I THINK THE EXPECTATIONS WERE 
TOO HIGH BECAUSE OF OF WHAT THE 
U.S. ACHIEVED IN LAST WORLD CUP.
I THINK IT'S BACK TO DRAWING 
BOARD. 
GET A FEW MORE PLAYERS. 
THEY NEED SOMEBODY IN MID-FIELD 
THAT CAN CREATE THANK YOU SO 
MUCH AND MOVE OF ALL, THEY HAVE 
TO DEVELOP A STRIKER, SOMEBODY
