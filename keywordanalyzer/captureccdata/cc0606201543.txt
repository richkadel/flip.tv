TIGERS HAVE WON FIVE STRAIGHT.
NINE OF THEIR LAST 10, 10 OF 
THEIR LAST 12.
BONDERMAN 5-0 ON THE ROAD THIS 
SEASON. 
THE TIGERS PROBABLY WISH THEY 
COULD PLAY ALL N.L. OPPONENTS 
THIS YEAR.
THEY'RE 6-1 THIS SEASON AGAINST 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OPPONENTS.
>> IS THIS THE WORST LOSS 
YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED?
>> NO, NO, WHEN I WAS 3 YEARS 
OLD AND PLAYING ON THE PEE-WEE 
TEAM WE GOT BEAT IN THE LAST 
SECOND. 
ASK ME A REAL [BEEP] QUESTION, 
OK? 
>> THE NBA HAS FINED MAVERICKS 
OWNER MARK CUBAN IN EXCESS OF 
$1 MILLION IN THE PAST MOSTLY 
FOR HIS CRITICISM OF 
OFFICIATING.
AFTER WHAT YOU JUST HEARD HE 
MAY BE RECEIVING ANOTHER LETTER 
IN THE MAIL.
BUT TIZZ TIME IN THE LEAGUE MAY 
BE DWINDLING. 
HE SUGGESTED MONDAY NIGHT IF HE 
DOESN'T SEE CHANGES IN THE 
LEAGUE HE WOULD CONSIDER 
SELLING THE MAVERICKS.
THEY WILL GET STACKHOUSE BACK 
FOR GAME SIX. 
AN EDGY STACK HAD A MESSAGE FOR 
SHAQ. 
>> I THINK HE MADE MORE OF IT 
THAN WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO P 
-- TO BE THE YOU DON'T WANT TO 
GET UP AND THROW NO BLOWS.
JUST KIND OF FIELD LED IT A 
LITTLE BIT. 
HE CAN GET CREDIT FOR HELPING 
ME FIELD IT.
>> JUST OUR ENERGY. 
ENERGY AND BEING A THREAT FOR 
US OFFENSIVELY, YOU KNOW, 
GIVING US ANOTHER TOUGH GUY OUT 
THERE THAT LIKES TO GET IN 
THERE AND MIX IT UP.
SO WE'LL GFT -- DEFINITELY 
WELCOME HIS TOUGHNESS BACK AND

A STACKHOUSE WAY. 
>> THE NBA WISHED DIRK NOWITZKI 
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY MONDAY BY 
FINING HIM FIVE GRAND FOR 
KICKING THE BALL INTO THE 
STANDS FOLLOWING GAME FIVE. 
WITH AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AHEAD TO 
GAME SIX, WE SEND YOU TO 
DALLAS. 
>> HERE WITH TIM LEGLER AND 
GREG ANTHONY, WE GET YOU READY 
FOR GAME SIX. 
I'M NOT SURE AS WE STOOD HERE 
AFTER GAME TWO WE THOUGHT THERE 
WOULD EVEN BE A GAME SIX, AND 
WITH ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
IN GAME THREE WE CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T THINK THERE WOULD BE THE 
DO YOU THINK DALLAS THAT THE -- 
THOUGHT THINK HAD THIS WON IN 
GAME THREE? 
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
DOUBT, COMPLACENCY SAT IN AND 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THAT GAME 
OND -- AND THE SERIES IN THE 
BAG.
IT'S A LESSON LEARNED AND A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
>> I KNOW ALL THE TRIPS I TOOK 
TO SOUTH BEACH WHEN I PLAYED, 
WE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT TIME AS A 
TEAM. 
I DON'T THINK DALLAS HAD THAT 
MUCH FUN IN MIAMI.
THEY'RE VERY GLAD TO BE COMING 
HOPE. 
THIS TEAM'S BEEN VERY GOOD IN 
THIS BUILDING THIS YEAR AND 
THEY DID SOME THINGS WELL IN 
MIAMI, THEY JUST DIDN'T FINISH 
GAMES.
THEY MADE MISTAKES DURING 
CRITICAL STRETCHES OR THIS 
SERIES COULD BE OVER BY NOW.
>> THAT TIME PERIOD, THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES OF GAME THREE, 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN 
OUTSCORED BY 40 POINTS. 
WHAT'S GONG DOCTOR GONE WRONG 
FOR DALLAS? 
>> WELL, IF YOU GO BACK TO GAME 
FIVE, I DON'T FEEL THEY BLEW 
GAME FIVE.
THAT WAS THE HEAT WINNING.
GAME THREE, THAT'S ANOTHER 
STORY.
THEY BLEW THAT ONE. 
BUT THEIR PSYCHE IS GOING TO BE 
FINE. 
THEY'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. 
REMEMBER, THEY STILL HAD A 
CHANCE TO WIN GAME FIVE WITHOUT 
JERRY STACKHOUSE, THEIR MOST 
POTENT SCORER OFF THE BENCH AND 
LEADER. 
>> WE GOT TO GIVE DWYANE WADE A 
LOT OF CREDIT.
HE HAS PRETTY MUCH TAKEN OVER 
THIS SERIES.
BUT IF YOU'RE AVERY JOHNSON, 
ADJUSTMENTS AREN'T ENOUGH.
YOU GOT TO FLAT-OUT MAKE A 
DETERMINATION YOU'RE NOT GOING 
TO LOSE TO ONE GUY. 
DWYANE WADE WAS ALLOWED PRETTY 
MUCH WHERE HE WANTED TO GO IN 
THE FOURTH QUARTER. 
CANNOT DO THIS. 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS GUY 
MAKE PLAYS FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WHEN AVERY JOHNSON GOT OFF 
THE CHARTER, HE SAID IT'S SO 
GOOD TO BE BACK IN TEXAS, CAN'T 
WAIT TO HEAR OUR HOME FANS IN 
GAME SIX AND GAME SEVEN.

THAT WAS THE PLAY OF THE GAME.
KYLE FARNSWORTH STRIKES HIM 
OUT, BUT THE BALL GETS PAST 
POSADA. 
AFTER THE INNING POSADA DID 
APOLOGIZE TO FARNSWORTH.
THAT SAYS IT ALL.

ROETHLISBERGER TOLD ESPN HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET 
WHILE RIDING HIS MOTORCYCLE 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE LAW. 
AND IT'S NOT THE LAW, ONLY IF 
YOU HAVE A VALID LICENSE, WHICH 
HE DID NOT THE PITTSBURGH 
POLICE SAY ROETHLISBERGER WILL 
BE FINED $388 FOR RIDING 
WITHOUT A LICENSE AND NOT 
WEARING A HELMET. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THE WOMAN WHO 
HE CRASHED INTO WILL BE CITED 
FOR FAILING TO YIELD. 
SHE FILED A POLICE REPORT 
SAYING SHE'S BEEN RECEIVING 
THREATENING PHONE CALLS.
MONDAY, STEELERS COACH BILL 
COWHER TALKED FOR THE FIRST 
TIME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.
>> THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE 
LESSONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DEVASTATING, COULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY TRAGIC STORY.
BUT THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO 
WALK AWAY AND IT APPEARS AT 
THIS TIME THAT THERE COULD BE 
NO REAL LONG LINGERING EFFECTS, 
HE COULD BE A GREAT MENTOR. 
IT COULD BE A GREAT STORY AND 
MAYBE HAVE A LINGERING POSITIVE 
EFFECT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
ARE IN HIS POSITION AND HAD 
THAT VIEWPOINT PRIOR TO THIS 
ACCIDENT. 
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL 
TAKE FROM IT. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S A GROWN MAN AND HAS TO 
MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONS.

THEY'VE BEEN OUTSTANDING AND 
BROUGHT ME TO THIS POINT. 
>> HOW MANY OF YOUR BUDDIES 
BACK IN SHERWOOD PARK PICKED 
YOU IN THEIR PLAYOFF POOL AT 
THE START OF THE PLAYOFFS?
>> NOT TOO MANY OF THEM!
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW THE OTHER TWO ROOKIE 
GOALIES WHO WON THE CONN 
SMYTHE? 
KEN DRYDEN AND PATRICK ROY. 
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU?
>> I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. 
IT'S A HUGE HONOR TO BE PUT IN 
THE SAME CATEGORIES AS THOSE 
GUYS. 
FOR OUR AUDIENCE IN THE STATES, 
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THAT 
FAMILIAR WITH SHERWOOD PARK.
THAT'S IN EDMONTON. 
ARE THEY GOING TO LET YOU BACK 
IN?

I'M GOING TO BE EXCITED TO GO 
BACK. 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY, FRIENDS FOR 
THE MOST PART ARE TORN BEING

AVERY JOHNSON AND THE FIRED-UP 
MAVERICKS ARE BACK HOME.

STEELERS Q.B. BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER ONE WEEK AFTER 
HIS MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT.
ONE -- NOW ON ESPNEWS.

STORIES AND MUCH MORE A LITTLE 
LATER ON ESPNEWS. 
LOS ANGELES MICHELLE BONNER I 
AM ANTHONY AMEY.
>> DATING BACK TO 1980 IN FINAL 
SERIES FOR THE NBA, NHL, AND 
MLB, THE HOME TEAM HAS WON A 
COMBINED 17 GAME SEVENS.
THAT SAID -- HURRICANES AND 
OILERS, GAME SEVEN FROM 
CAROLINA. 
CAROLINA TRYING TO BECOME THE 
FIRST EIGHT SEED TO WIN THE 
STANLEY CUP.
THE HOME TEAM IN THE NHL HAS 
WON THE LAST FIVE STANLEY CUPS. 
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES INTO THE 
GAME. 
PASS FROM BEHIND THE GOAL.
AARON WARD, THE WRISTER.
RIGHT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND THE 
CANES ARE UP EARLY. 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
FIVE GUYS.
RIGHT THROUGH THE DEFENSE THE 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR TO CRAIG ADAMS. 
ADAMS APPEARED TO SCORE.
IT'S RULED A NO-GOAL. 
STAIOS'S PAD POSITIONED THE 
PUCK, STOMACH DOES NOT TOUCH 
IT. 
NO GOAL ON THAT ONE.
>> SECOND PERIOD, MATT CULLEN 
FEEDING MARK REEK -- RECCHI 
SKATELE IN ON MARKKANEN, WHO

THIRD PERIOD, 63 SECONDS INTO 
THE PERIOD, FERNANDO PISANI 
WITH HIS 14TH GOAL OF THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
HE LIT THE LAMP JUST 18 TIMES 
DURING THE ENTIRE REGULAR 
SEASON. 
CULTS THE LEAD TO 2-1.
LATER, RAFFI TORRES TAKING A 
SHOT OFF THE REBOUND. 
PISANI TRIES TO STUFF IT HOME 
BUT WARD DENIES HIM.
ONE OF 22 SAVES FOR THE ROOKIE. 
AND 3-1 FOR THE HURRICANES. 
THE OILERS OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL, 
COMING SO CLOSE.
AND CAPTAIN ROD BRIND'AMOUR 
AFTER 16 YEARS GETS TO HOST THE 
STANLEY CUP.
CAM WARD YOUR CONN SMYTHE 
WINNER.

FIVE HE HAD A LUMP IN HIS 
CHEST.
THAT LUMP IS GONE.
CAM WARD ENDS UP WINNING MORE 
GAMES IN THE PLAYOFFS THAN IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON. 
THE HOME TEAM IMPROVES TO 12-2 
ALL-TIME IN GAME SEVENS OF THE 
FINALS.

THIS TUESDAY AND THEY WILL TAKE 
IT AROUND THEIR ARENA.
AS FOR THE ROOKIE, THE 
22-YEAR-OLD CAM WARD, THE CONN 
SMYTHE WINNER, HERE HE IS AFTER 
THE GAME. 
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S YOUR 
ROOKIE SEASON AND CHANCES ARE 
IT WILL COME AGAIN BUT YOU JUST 
NEVER KNOW. 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE CARE OF 
THE PRESENT AND TAKE OF THAT 
OPPORTUNITY.
AS FOR WES AND RODDY AND ALL 
THOSE VETERAN GUYS, DOUGIE, I 
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR THEM. 
>> WHEN YOU WORK, YOUR LIFE'S 
WORK IT -- IS TO TRY TO WIN A 
STANLEY CUP AND UP FALL SHORT 
LIKE WE DID TONIGHT, IT'S A 
DISAPPOINTMENT. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, PRETTY GOOD 
EFFORT. 
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
I GUESS TO WAIT 18 YEARS AND BE 
ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCE IT 
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NEVER 
-- IT WAS NEVER, EVER ABOUT ME. 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERY GUY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM.
>> AFTER GAME SIX I JUST KEPT 
THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN LET THIS GO, THERE'S TOO 
MANY GUYS THAT DESERVE THIS.
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S I GUESS 
WHEN IT ALL JUST CAME TO A 
HEAD, THAT EMOTION. 
>> IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER GAME SEVEN IN 
THE LAST 30 YEARS ONLY FOUR 
TEAMS HAVE PLAYED A GAME SEVEN 
IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS AFTER 
WINNING A GAME SEVEN IN THEIR 
CONFERENCE FINAL. 
ALL FOUR OF THOSE TEAMS DID GO 
ON TO WIN THE STANLEY CUP IN 
THAT DECISIVE SEVENTH GAME OF 
THE FINAL.
FOR MORE ON THIS GAME, HERE ARE 
STEVE LEVY AND BARRY MELROSE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAROLINA 
COLLAPSE OF ALL-TIME SPORTS.
IN THE END THE HURRICANES 
REBOUND FROM AN ALL OF GAME SIX 
TO WIN THE UP?
GAME SEVEN. 
>> AND THEY DID IT THE WAY 
EDMONTON GOT TO GAME SEVEN, 
WITH PASSION, SPEED, AND 
CHARACTER.
THEY CAME OUT WITH ENERGY, 
LOOKED FASTER AND HUNGRIER THAN 
THE EDMONTON OILERS.
GREAT JOCK BY PETER LAVIOLETTE

FOR YEARS TO COME.

REGION AND IF THE TRIANGLE HAD 
A FOURTH POINT THAT JUST MIGHT 
INCLUDE HARTFORD. 
MORE COMING UP LATER. 
BACK TO UP. 
>> WELL.
HURRICANES' WIN THIS BE IS THE 
SEVENTH TIME IN THE LAST 11 
SEASONS, OF COURSE NOT 
INCLUDING THE CANCELLED SEASON, 
THAT THE TEAM HAS WON THE 
STANLEY CUP AFTER THAT

IT'S THEIR WORST SHUTOUT LOSS 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2 OF LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY LOST 7-0 TO THE

THIS YEAR.
THEY'RE 6-1 THIS SEASON AGAINST

YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED?

GAME THREE? 
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
DOUBT, COMPLACENCY SAT IN AND 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THAT GAME 
OND -- AND THE SERIES IN THE 
BAG.
IT'S A LESSON LEARNED AND A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
>> I KNOW ALL THE TRIPS I TOOK 
TO SOUTH BEACH WHEN I PLAYED, 
WE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT TIME AS A 
TEAM. 
I DON'T THINK DALLAS HAD THAT 
MUCH FUN IN MIAMI.
THEY'RE VERY GLAD TO BE COMING 
HOPE. 
THIS TEAM'S BEEN VERY GOOD IN 
THIS BUILDING THIS YEAR AND 
THEY DID SOME THINGS WELL IN 
MIAMI, THEY JUST DIDN'T FINISH 
GAMES.
THEY MADE MISTAKES DURING 
CRITICAL STRETCHES OR THIS 
SERIES COULD BE OVER BY NOW.
>> THAT TIME PERIOD, THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES OF GAME THREE, 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN 
OUTSCORED BY 40 POINTS. 
WHAT'S GONG DOCTOR GONE WRONG 
FOR DALLAS? 
>> WELL, IF YOU GO BACK TO GAME 
FIVE, I DON'T FEEL THEY BLEW 
GAME FIVE.
THAT WAS THE HEAT WINNING.
GAME THREE, THAT'S ANOTHER 
STORY.
THEY BLEW THAT ONE. 
BUT THEIR PSYCHE IS GOING TO BE 
FINE. 
THEY'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. 
REMEMBER, THEY STILL HAD A 
CHANCE TO WIN GAME FIVE WITHOUT 
JERRY STACKHOUSE, THEIR MOST 
POTENT SCORER OFF THE BENCH AND 
LEADER. 
>> WE GOT TO GIVE DWYANE WADE A 
LOT OF CREDIT.
HE HAS PRETTY MUCH TAKEN OVER 
THIS SERIES.
BUT IF YOU'RE AVERY JOHNSON, 
ADJUSTMENTS AREN'T ENOUGH.
YOU GOT TO FLAT-OUT MAKE A 
DETERMINATION YOU'RE NOT GOING 
TO LOSE TO ONE GUY. 
DWYANE WADE WAS ALLOWED PRETTY 
MUCH WHERE HE WANTED TO GO IN 
THE FOURTH QUARTER. 
CANNOT DO THIS. 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS GUY 
MAKE PLAYS FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WHEN AVERY JOHNSON GOT OFF 
THE CHARTER, HE SAID IT'S SO 
GOOD TO BE BACK IN TEXAS, CAN'T 
WAIT TO HEAR OUR HOME FANS IN 
GAME SIX AND GAME SEVEN.
BACK TO UP. 
>> STILL TO COME ON ESPNEWS, 
ALEX RODRIGUEZ HAS STRUCK OUT 
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE. 
COULD HE KEEP THE YANKEES FROM 
STRIKING OUT AGAINST PHILLY ON 
MONDAY NIGHT? 
>> AND ONE WEEK AFTER THE 
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT WHICH 
HOSPITALIZED BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER, HE RECEIVED A 
NOT SO WELCOME NOTE IN FROM THE 
AUTHORITIES.
WE'LL EXPLAIN.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.

YOU CAN MAKE IT 19. 
THAT ENDS THE THREAT. 
K'S 11 IN 6 2/3.
SAME INNING, ABRAHAM NUNEZ, 
GREAT DIVING STOP FOR THE OUT.
YANKEES MANAGER JOE TORRE SAID 
THAT WAS THE PLAY OF THE GAME.
KYLE FARNSWORTH STRIKES HIM 
OUT, BUT THE BALL GETS PAST 
POSADA. 
AFTER THE INNING POSADA DID 
APOLOGIZE TO FARNSWORTH.
THAT SAYS IT ALL. 
THE YANKS HAVE LOST THREE IN A 
ROW.
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, OR 
PERHAPS INJURY TO INSULT, 
OCTAVIO DOTEL'S COMEBACK TO 
REJOIN THE YANKS THIS WEEK HAS 
COME TO A HALT. 
HE HAS TENDINITIS.
>> WAIVED BY THE ROYALS FRIDAY, 
EMERGENCY STARTER KYLE SNYDER 
TOOK THE HILL AND HIS BOSTON 
DEBUT DIDN'T QUITE START OUT 
LIKE HE PLANNED.
JOSE VIDRO, SOLO JACK.
HIS FIFTH.

BOSTON NOW 6-1 IN INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY THIS YEAR.
>> LAST JULY, BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER TOLD ESPN HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET 
WHILE RIDING HIS MOTORCYCLE 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE LAW. 
AND IT'S NOT THE LAW, ONLY IF 
YOU HAVE A VALID LICENSE, WHICH 
HE DID NOT THE PITTSBURGH 
POLICE SAY ROETHLISBERGER WILL 
BE FINED $388 FOR RIDING 
WITHOUT A LICENSE AND NOT 
WEARING A HELMET. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THE WOMAN WHO 
HE CRASHED INTO WILL BE CITED 
FOR FAILING TO YIELD. 
SHE FILED A POLICE REPORT 
SAYING SHE'S BEEN RECEIVING 
THREATENING PHONE CALLS.
MONDAY, STEELERS COACH BILL 
COWHER TALKED FOR THE FIRST 
TIME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.
>> THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE 
LESSONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DEVASTATING, COULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY TRAGIC STORY.
BUT THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO 
WALK AWAY AND IT APPEARS AT 
THIS TIME THAT THERE COULD BE 
NO REAL LONG LINGERING EFFECTS, 
HE COULD BE A GREAT MENTOR. 
IT COULD BE A GREAT STORY AND 
MAYBE HAVE A LINGERING POSITIVE 
EFFECT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
ARE IN HIS POSITION AND HAD 
THAT VIEWPOINT PRIOR TO THIS 
ACCIDENT. 
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL 
TAKE FROM IT. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S A GROWN MAN AND HAS TO 
MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONS.
>> MEANWHILE, STEELERS ROOKIE 
RECEIVER SANTONIO HOLMES 
PLEADED NOT GUILTY MONDAY TO 
CHARGES OF ASSAULTING THE 
MOTHER OF ONE OF HIS CHILDREN.
THIS IS HIS SECOND ARREST SINCE 
BEING DRAFTED IN APRIL.

>> HOW MANY OF YOUR BUDDIES 
BACK IN SHERWOOD PARK PICKED

>> NOT TOO MANY OF THEM!
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW THE OTHER TWO ROOKIE 
GOALIES WHO WON THE CONN 
SMYTHE? 
KEN DRYDEN AND PATRICK ROY. 
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU?
>> I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. 
IT'S A HUGE HONOR TO BE PUT IN

FOR OUR AUDIENCE IN THE STATES, 
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THAT 
FAMILIAR WITH SHERWOOD PARK.

LOS ANGELES MICHELLE BONNER I 
AM ANTHONY AMEY.
>> DATING BACK TO 1980 IN FINAL 
SERIES FOR THE NBA, NHL, AND 
MLB, THE HOME TEAM HAS WON A 
COMBINED 17 GAME SEVENS.
THAT SAID -- HURRICANES AND 
OILERS, GAME SEVEN FROM 
CAROLINA. 
CAROLINA TRYING TO BECOME THE 
FIRST EIGHT SEED TO WIN THE 
STANLEY CUP.
THE HOME TEAM IN THE NHL HAS 
WON THE LAST FIVE STANLEY CUPS. 
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES INTO THE 
GAME. 
PASS FROM BEHIND THE GOAL.
AARON WARD, THE WRISTER.
RIGHT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND THE 
CANES ARE UP EARLY. 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
FIVE GUYS.
RIGHT THROUGH THE DEFENSE THE 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR TO CRAIG ADAMS. 
ADAMS APPEARED TO SCORE.
IT'S RULED A NO-GOAL. 
STAIOS'S PAD POSITIONED THE 
PUCK, STOMACH DOES NOT TOUCH 
IT. 
NO GOAL ON THAT ONE.
>> SECOND PERIOD, MATT CULLEN 
FEEDING MARK REEK -- RECCHI 
SKATELE IN ON MARKKANEN, WHO 
PROVIDES THE BEAUTIFUL KICK 
SAVE. 
LESS THAN A MINUTE LATER, CANE 
ON THE POWER PLAY.
FRANK KABERLE WITH THE SLAPSHOT 
AND THE SCORE.
HE SCORES FOR THE FOURTH TIME 
THIS POSTSEASON.
THIRD PERIOD, 63 SECONDS INTO 
THE PERIOD, FERNANDO PISANI 
WITH HIS 14TH GOAL OF THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
HE LIT THE LAMP JUST 18 TIMES 
DURING THE ENTIRE REGULAR 
SEASON. 
CULTS THE LEAD TO 2-1.
LATER, RAFFI TORRES TAKING A 
SHOT OFF THE REBOUND. 
PISANI TRIES TO STUFF IT HOME 
BUT WARD DENIES HIM.
ONE OF 22 SAVES FOR THE ROOKIE. 
AND 3-1 FOR THE HURRICANES. 
THE OILERS OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL, 
COMING SO CLOSE.
AND CAPTAIN ROD BRIND'AMOUR 
AFTER 16 YEARS GETS TO HOST THE 
STANLEY CUP.
CAM WARD YOUR CONN SMYTHE 
WINNER. 
>> BRIND'AMOUR SAID AFTER GAME 
FIVE HE HAD A LUMP IN HIS 
CHEST.
THAT LUMP IS GONE.
CAM WARD ENDS UP WINNING MORE 
GAMES IN THE PLAYOFFS THAN IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON. 
THE HOME TEAM IMPROVES TO 12-2 
ALL-TIME IN GAME SEVENS OF THE 
FINALS.
>> THE PARADE FOR THEIR 
FIRST-EVER STANLEY CUP WILL BE 
THIS TUESDAY AND THEY WILL TAKE 
IT AROUND THEIR ARENA.
AS FOR THE ROOKIE, THE 
22-YEAR-OLD CAM WARD, THE CONN 
SMYTHE WINNER, HERE HE IS AFTER 
THE GAME. 
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S YOUR 
ROOKIE SEASON AND CHANCES ARE 
IT WILL COME AGAIN BUT YOU JUST 
NEVER KNOW. 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE CARE OF 
THE PRESENT AND TAKE OF THAT 
OPPORTUNITY.
AS FOR WES AND RODDY AND ALL 
THOSE VETERAN GUYS, DOUGIE, I 
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR THEM. 
>> WHEN YOU WORK, YOUR LIFE'S 
WORK IT -- IS TO TRY TO WIN A 
STANLEY CUP AND UP FALL SHORT 
LIKE WE DID TONIGHT, IT'S A 
DISAPPOINTMENT. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, PRETTY GOOD 
EFFORT. 
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
I GUESS TO WAIT 18 YEARS AND BE 
ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCE IT 
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NEVER 
-- IT WAS NEVER, EVER ABOUT ME. 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERY GUY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM.
>> AFTER GAME SIX I JUST KEPT 
THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN LET THIS GO, THERE'S TOO 
MANY GUYS THAT DESERVE THIS.
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S I GUESS 
WHEN IT ALL JUST CAME TO A 
HEAD, THAT EMOTION. 
>> IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER GAME SEVEN IN 
THE LAST 30 YEARS ONLY FOUR 
TEAMS HAVE PLAYED A GAME SEVEN 
IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS AFTER 
WINNING A GAME SEVEN IN THEIR 
CONFERENCE FINAL. 
ALL FOUR OF THOSE TEAMS DID GO 
ON TO WIN THE STANLEY CUP IN 
THAT DECISIVE SEVENTH GAME OF 
THE FINAL.
FOR MORE ON THIS GAME, HERE ARE 
STEVE LEVY AND BARRY MELROSE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAROLINA 
COLLAPSE OF ALL-TIME SPORTS.
IN THE END THE HURRICANES 
REBOUND FROM AN ALL OF GAME SIX 
TO WIN THE UP?
GAME SEVEN. 
>> AND THEY DID IT THE WAY 
EDMONTON GOT TO GAME SEVEN, 
WITH PASSION, SPEED, AND 
CHARACTER.
THEY CAME OUT WITH ENERGY, 
LOOKED FASTER AND HUNGRIER THAN 
THE EDMONTON OILERS.
GREAT JOCK BY PETER LAVIOLETTE 
GETTING THAT TEAM READY TO PLAY 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
AWESOME, AWESOME JOB BY 
EVERYBODY.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WARD 
BROTHERS. 
CARRY -- AARON WARD SCORING 
EARLY, NO RELATIONND -- AND CAM 
WARD. 
>> NOW HE'S GOT A STANLEY CUP 
RING, GOING TO WIN THE CONN 
SMYTHE. 
22 YEARS OLD. 
UNBELIEVABLE STORY. 
KID'S GOT ICE WATER IN HIS 
VEINS.
WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE 
PLAYOFFS WILL BE TALKED ABOUT 
FOR YEARS TO COME.
>> SMILES ALL OVER THE TRIANGLE 
REGION AND IF THE TRIANGLE HAD 
A FOURTH POINT THAT JUST MIGHT 
INCLUDE HARTFORD. 
MORE COMING UP LATER. 
BACK TO UP. 
>> WELL.
HURRICANES' WIN THIS BE IS THE 
SEVENTH TIME IN THE LAST 11 
SEASONS, OF COURSE NOT 
INCLUDING THE CANCELLED SEASON, 
THAT THE TEAM HAS WON THE 
STANLEY CUP AFTER THAT 
FRANCHISE HAS MOVED FROM ITS 
ORIGINAL LOCATION.
>> TO BASEBALL NOW. 
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO, THE GIANTS 
AND ANGELS BATTLED EACH OTHER.
MATT CAIN WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL

CABRERA.
CHONE FIGGINS STEALS SECOND.
ANGELS SCORE A RUN WITHOUT 
BENEFIT OF A HIT. 
TOP FOUR, GARRET ANDERSON, 
ROBBED BY MARK SWEENEY. 
CAIN HAD A NO-HITTER THROUGH

1976.

MORALES GOES DOWN.
BACK UP, BACK DOWN. 
STRIKES OUT THE SIDE IN SEVEN.
TOM EIGHT, TIM SALMON LOOKING.
CAREER HIGH 10 K'S FOR THE

HIS 128TH PITCH IS LINED INTO

THAT'S THE ONLY HIT HE ALLOWED 
IN EIGHT INNINGS OF WORK AS THE 
GIANTS GET THE 2-1 WIN.

MATT HOLIDAY, HIS 15TH OF THE 
YEAR OFF HAREN. 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM HAD ALLOWED 14 
EARNED RUNS OVER HIS LAST THREE 
GAMES.
GETS NICK SWISHER THERE.
HE PITCHED SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS. 
ROCKIES GO UP 3-0 AND WOULD GO 
ON TO SHUT OUT THE A'S 7-0. 
SO OAKLAND'S 10-GAME WINNING 
STREAK IS SNAPPED.
IT'S THEIR WORST SHUTOUT LOSS 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2 OF LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY LOST 7-0 TO THE 
YANKEES.
MATT HOLLIDAY, BOY, HE'S BEEN 
INCREDIBLE, BATTING .479 OVER 
HIS LAST 12 GAMES

TOO.
KEN GRIFFEY JR., 440-FOOT 
BLAST.

TOP EIGHT.
BASES LOADED FOR BRANDON 
PHILLIPS. 
THE DOUBLE WOULD SCORE ADAM 
DUNN AND AUSTIN KEARNS.
>> EL DUQUE, THE HARD-LUCK 
LOSER.
AS A DIAMONDBACK AND MET THIS 
SEASON HE IS 5-0 AT HOME. 
>> COMING OFF A FRANCHISE-TYING 
EIGHT HOME RUNS MONDAY, THE 
TIGERS WERE IN MILWAUKEE MONDAY 
NIGHT.
GREAT PITCHING MATCH. 
JEREMY BONDERMAN STRUCK OUT 12 
IN SEVEN INNINGS. 
HE'S PITCHED BACK-TO-BACK 12 X 
GAMES.
GETS GRANDERSON LOOKING.
THEN PLACIDO POLANCO. 
BOTTOM SEVEN, FIELDER OFF 
BONDERMAN.
HIS 14TH OF THE YEAR. 
THE BREWERS ARE UP 1-0. 
TOP EIGHT, TIED 1-1.
TWO ON MORE MAGGLIO ORDONEZ.
THAT ONE OFF THE RIGHT FIELD 
WALL. 
TWO RUNS SCORE. 
THE TIGERS WILL TAKE A 
THREE-RUN LEAD AND THAT WILL 
STAND YOU UP AS THE FINAL.
TIGERS HAVE WON FIVE STRAIGHT.
NINE OF THEIR LAST 10, 10 OF 
THEIR LAST 12.
BONDERMAN 5-0 ON THE ROAD THIS 
SEASON. 
THE TIGERS PROBABLY WISH THEY 
COULD PLAY ALL N.L. OPPONENTS 
THIS YEAR.
THEY'RE 6-1 THIS SEASON AGAINST 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OPPONENTS.
>> IS THIS THE WORST LOSS 
YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED?
>> NO, NO, WHEN I WAS 3 YEARS 
OLD AND PLAYING ON THE PEE-WEE 
TEAM WE GOT BEAT IN THE LAST 
SECOND. 
ASK ME A REAL [BEEP] QUESTION, 
OK? 
>> THE NBA HAS FINED MAVERICKS 
OWNER MARK CUBAN IN EXCESS OF 
$1 MILLION IN THE PAST MOSTLY 
FOR HIS CRITICISM OF 
OFFICIATING.
AFTER WHAT YOU JUST HEARD HE 
MAY BE RECEIVING ANOTHER LETTER 
IN THE MAIL.
BUT TIZZ TIME IN THE LEAGUE MAY 
BE DWINDLING. 
HE SUGGESTED MONDAY NIGHT IF HE 
DOESN'T SEE CHANGES IN THE 
LEAGUE HE WOULD CONSIDER 
SELLING THE MAVERICKS.
THEY WILL GET STACKHOUSE BACK 
FOR GAME SIX. 
AN EDGY STACK HAD A MESSAGE FOR 
SHAQ. 
>> I THINK HE MADE MORE OF IT 
THAN WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO P 
-- TO BE THE YOU DON'T WANT TO 
GET UP AND THROW NO BLOWS.
JUST KIND OF FIELD LED IT A 
LITTLE BIT. 
HE CAN GET CREDIT FOR HELPING 
ME FIELD IT.
>> JUST OUR ENERGY. 
ENERGY AND BEING A THREAT FOR 
US OFFENSIVELY, YOU KNOW, 
GIVING US ANOTHER TOUGH GUY OUT 
THERE THAT LIKES TO GET IN 
THERE AND MIX IT UP.
SO WE'LL GFT -- DEFINITELY 
WELCOME HIS TOUGHNESS BACK AND 
THE WAY HE SPACES THE FLOOR FOR 
US AND GETS THINGS DONE IN ONLY 
A STACKHOUSE WAY. 
>> THE NBA WISHED DIRK NOWITZKI 
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY MONDAY BY 
FINING HIM FIVE GRAND FOR 
KICKING THE BALL INTO THE 
STANDS FOLLOWING GAME FIVE. 
WITH AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AHEAD TO 
GAME SIX, WE SEND YOU TO 
DALLAS. 
>> HERE WITH TIM LEGLER AND 
GREG ANTHONY, WE GET YOU READY 
FOR GAME SIX. 
I'M NOT SURE AS WE STOOD HERE 
AFTER GAME TWO WE THOUGHT THERE 
WOULD EVEN BE A GAME SIX, AND 
WITH ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
IN GAME THREE WE CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T THINK THERE WOULD BE THE 
DO YOU THINK DALLAS THAT THE -- 
THOUGHT THINK HAD THIS WON IN 
GAME THREE? 
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
DOUBT, COMPLACENCY SAT IN AND 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THAT GAME 
OND -- AND THE SERIES IN THE 
BAG.
IT'S A LESSON LEARNED AND A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
>> I KNOW ALL THE TRIPS I TOOK 
TO SOUTH BEACH WHEN I PLAYED, 
WE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT TIME AS A 
TEAM. 
I DON'T THINK DALLAS HAD THAT 
MUCH FUN IN MIAMI.
THEY'RE VERY GLAD TO BE COMING 
HOPE. 
THIS TEAM'S BEEN VERY GOOD IN 
THIS BUILDING THIS YEAR AND 
THEY DID SOME THINGS WELL IN 
MIAMI, THEY JUST DIDN'T FINISH 
GAMES.
THEY MADE MISTAKES DURING 
CRITICAL STRETCHES OR THIS 
SERIES COULD BE OVER BY NOW.
>> THAT TIME PERIOD, THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES OF GAME THREE, 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN 
OUTSCORED BY 40 POINTS. 
WHAT'S GONG DOCTOR GONE WRONG 
FOR DALLAS? 
>> WELL, IF YOU GO BACK TO GAME 
FIVE, I DON'T FEEL THEY BLEW 
GAME FIVE.
THAT WAS THE HEAT WINNING.
GAME THREE, THAT'S ANOTHER 
STORY.
THEY BLEW THAT ONE. 
BUT THEIR PSYCHE IS GOING TO BE 
FINE. 
THEY'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. 
REMEMBER, THEY STILL HAD A 
CHANCE TO WIN GAME FIVE WITHOUT 
JERRY STACKHOUSE, THEIR MOST 
POTENT SCORER OFF THE BENCH AND 
LEADER. 
>> WE GOT TO GIVE DWYANE WADE A 
LOT OF CREDIT.
HE HAS PRETTY MUCH TAKEN OVER 
THIS SERIES.
BUT IF YOU'RE AVERY JOHNSON, 
ADJUSTMENTS AREN'T ENOUGH.
YOU GOT TO FLAT-OUT MAKE A 
DETERMINATION YOU'RE NOT GOING 
TO LOSE TO ONE GUY. 
DWYANE WADE WAS ALLOWED PRETTY 
MUCH WHERE HE WANTED TO GO IN 
THE FOURTH QUARTER. 
CANNOT DO THIS. 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS GUY 
MAKE PLAYS FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WHEN AVERY JOHNSON GOT OFF 
THE CHARTER, HE SAID IT'S SO 
GOOD TO BE BACK IN TEXAS, CAN'T 
WAIT TO HEAR OUR HOME FANS IN 
GAME SIX AND GAME SEVEN.
BACK TO UP. 
>> STILL TO COME ON ESPNEWS, 
ALEX RODRIGUEZ HAS STRUCK OUT 
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE. 
COULD HE KEEP THE YANKEES FROM 
STRIKING OUT AGAINST PHILLY ON 
MONDAY NIGHT? 
>> AND ONE WEEK AFTER THE 
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT WHICH 
HOSPITALIZED BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER, HE RECEIVED A 
NOT SO WELCOME NOTE IN FROM THE

WE'LL EXPLAIN.

PHILLY. 
PAT BURRELL DOWN THE LEFT-FIELD

TWO RUNNERS SCORE.
PHILS UP 2-1. 
TO FIVE, ALEX RODRIGUEZ UP 
AGAINST BRETT MYERS.
A-ROD BATTING .212 IN THE MONTH 
OF JUN 18 K'S.
YOU CAN MAKE IT 19. 
THAT ENDS THE THREAT. 
K'S 11 IN 6 2/3.
SAME INNING, ABRAHAM NUNEZ, 
GREAT DIVING STOP FOR THE OUT.
YANKEES MANAGER JOE TORRE SAID 
THAT WAS THE PLAY OF THE GAME.
KYLE FARNSWORTH STRIKES HIM 
OUT, BUT THE BALL GETS PAST 
POSADA. 
AFTER THE INNING POSADA DID 
APOLOGIZE TO FARNSWORTH.
THAT SAYS IT ALL. 
THE YANKS HAVE LOST THREE IN A 
ROW.
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, OR 
PERHAPS INJURY TO INSULT, 
OCTAVIO DOTEL'S COMEBACK TO 
REJOIN THE YANKS THIS WEEK HAS 
COME TO A HALT. 
HE HAS TENDINITIS.
>> WAIVED BY THE ROYALS FRIDAY,

INSULT TO INJURY FOR PITTSBURGH 
STEELERS Q.B. BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER ONE WEEK AFTER

STORIES AND MUCH MORE A LITTLE 
LATER ON ESPNEWS. 
LOS ANGELES MICHELLE BONNER I 
AM ANTHONY AMEY.
>> DATING BACK TO 1980 IN FINAL 
SERIES FOR THE NBA, NHL, AND 
MLB, THE HOME TEAM HAS WON A 
COMBINED 17 GAME SEVENS.
THAT SAID -- HURRICANES AND 
OILERS, GAME SEVEN FROM 
CAROLINA. 
CAROLINA TRYING TO BECOME THE 
FIRST EIGHT SEED TO WIN THE 
STANLEY CUP.
THE HOME TEAM IN THE NHL HAS 
WON THE LAST FIVE STANLEY CUPS. 
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES INTO THE 
GAME. 
PASS FROM BEHIND THE GOAL.
AARON WARD, THE WRISTER.
RIGHT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND THE 
CANES ARE UP EARLY. 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
FIVE GUYS.
RIGHT THROUGH THE DEFENSE THE 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR TO CRAIG ADAMS. 
ADAMS APPEARED TO SCORE.
IT'S RULED A NO-GOAL. 
STAIOS'S PAD POSITIONED THE 
PUCK, STOMACH DOES NOT TOUCH

NO GOAL ON THAT ONE.
>> SECOND PERIOD, MATT CULLEN

WITH HIS 14TH GOAL OF THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
HE LIT THE LAMP JUST 18 TIMES 
DURING THE ENTIRE REGULAR 
SEASON. 
CULTS THE LEAD TO 2-1.
LATER, RAFFI TORRES TAKING A 
SHOT OFF THE REBOUND. 
PISANI TRIES TO STUFF IT HOME 
BUT WARD DENIES HIM.
ONE OF 22 SAVES FOR THE ROOKIE. 
AND 3-1 FOR THE HURRICANES. 
THE OILERS OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL, 
COMING SO CLOSE.
AND CAPTAIN ROD BRIND'AMOUR 
AFTER 16 YEARS GETS TO HOST THE 
STANLEY CUP.
CAM WARD YOUR CONN SMYTHE 
WINNER. 
>> BRIND'AMOUR SAID AFTER GAME 
FIVE HE HAD A LUMP IN HIS 
CHEST.
THAT LUMP IS GONE.
CAM WARD ENDS UP WINNING MORE 
GAMES IN THE PLAYOFFS THAN IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON. 
THE HOME TEAM IMPROVES TO 12-2 
ALL-TIME IN GAME SEVENS OF THE 
FINALS.
>> THE PARADE FOR THEIR 
FIRST-EVER STANLEY CUP WILL BE 
THIS TUESDAY AND THEY WILL TAKE 
IT AROUND THEIR ARENA.
AS FOR THE ROOKIE, THE 
22-YEAR-OLD CAM WARD, THE CONN 
SMYTHE WINNER, HERE HE IS AFTER 
THE GAME. 
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S YOUR 
ROOKIE SEASON AND CHANCES ARE 
IT WILL COME AGAIN BUT YOU JUST 
NEVER KNOW. 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE CARE OF 
THE PRESENT AND TAKE OF THAT 
OPPORTUNITY.
AS FOR WES AND RODDY AND ALL 
THOSE VETERAN GUYS, DOUGIE, I 
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR THEM. 
>> WHEN YOU WORK, YOUR LIFE'S 
WORK IT -- IS TO TRY TO WIN A 
STANLEY CUP AND UP FALL SHORT 
LIKE WE DID TONIGHT, IT'S A 
DISAPPOINTMENT. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, PRETTY GOOD 
EFFORT. 
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
I GUESS TO WAIT 18 YEARS AND BE 
ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCE IT 
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NEVER 
-- IT WAS NEVER, EVER ABOUT ME. 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERY GUY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM.
>> AFTER GAME SIX I JUST KEPT 
THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN LET THIS GO, THERE'S TOO 
MANY GUYS THAT DESERVE THIS.
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S I GUESS 
WHEN IT ALL JUST CAME TO A 
HEAD, THAT EMOTION. 
>> IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER GAME SEVEN IN 
THE LAST 30 YEARS ONLY FOUR 
TEAMS HAVE PLAYED A GAME SEVEN 
IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS AFTER 
WINNING A GAME SEVEN IN THEIR 
CONFERENCE FINAL. 
ALL FOUR OF THOSE TEAMS DID GO 
ON TO WIN THE STANLEY CUP IN 
THAT DECISIVE SEVENTH GAME OF 
THE FINAL.
FOR MORE ON THIS GAME, HERE ARE 
STEVE LEVY AND BARRY MELROSE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAROLINA 
COLLAPSE OF ALL-TIME SPORTS.
IN THE END THE HURRICANES 
REBOUND FROM AN ALL OF GAME SIX 
TO WIN THE UP?
GAME SEVEN. 
>> AND THEY DID IT THE WAY 
EDMONTON GOT TO GAME SEVEN, 
WITH PASSION, SPEED, AND 
CHARACTER.
THEY CAME OUT WITH ENERGY, 
LOOKED FASTER AND HUNGRIER THAN 
THE EDMONTON OILERS.
GREAT JOCK BY PETER LAVIOLETTE 
GETTING THAT TEAM READY TO PLAY 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
AWESOME, AWESOME JOB BY 
EVERYBODY.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WARD 
BROTHERS. 
CARRY -- AARON WARD SCORING 
EARLY, NO RELATIONND -- AND CAM 
WARD. 
>> NOW HE'S GOT A STANLEY CUP 
RING, GOING TO WIN THE CONN 
SMYTHE. 
22 YEARS OLD. 
UNBELIEVABLE STORY. 
KID'S GOT ICE WATER IN HIS 
VEINS.
WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE 
PLAYOFFS WILL BE TALKED ABOUT 
FOR YEARS TO COME.
>> SMILES ALL OVER THE TRIANGLE 
REGION AND IF THE TRIANGLE HAD 
A FOURTH POINT THAT JUST MIGHT 
INCLUDE HARTFORD. 
MORE COMING UP LATER. 
BACK TO UP. 
>> WELL.
HURRICANES' WIN THIS BE IS THE 
SEVENTH TIME IN THE LAST 11 
SEASONS, OF COURSE NOT 
INCLUDING THE CANCELLED SEASON, 
THAT THE TEAM HAS WON THE 
STANLEY CUP AFTER THAT 
FRANCHISE HAS MOVED FROM ITS 
ORIGINAL LOCATION.
>> TO BASEBALL NOW. 
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO, THE GIANTS 
AND ANGELS BATTLED EACH OTHER.
MATT CAIN WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 
THEN. 
TOP FOUR, DEALING TO ORLANDO 
CABRERA.
CHONE FIGGINS STEALS SECOND.
ANGELS SCORE A RUN WITHOUT 
BENEFIT OF A HIT. 
TOP FOUR, GARRET ANDERSON, 
ROBBED BY MARK SWEENEY. 
CAIN HAD A NO-HITTER THROUGH 
FOUR. 
TOP FIVE, PROTECTING THAT 2-1 
LEAD. 
THE COUNT -- LAST GIANT TO HIT 
-- TOSS A NO-HITTER WAS IN 
1976. 
TOP SEVEN, MIKE NAPOLI. 
MORALES GOES DOWN.
BACK UP, BACK DOWN. 
STRIKES OUT THE SIDE IN SEVEN.
TOM EIGHT, TIM SALMON LOOKING.
CAREER HIGH 10 K'S FOR THE 
21-YEAR-OLD MATT CAIN.
HIS 128TH PITCH IS LINED INTO 
CENTER. 
THE NO-HIT BID IS OVER. 
THAT'S THE ONLY HIT HE ALLOWED 
IN EIGHT INNINGS OF WORK AS THE 
GIANTS GET THE 2-1 WIN. 
BEFORE THE GAME THE ASSOCIAa)$.$.$.$. .
MEN OF THE SQUARE TABLE,
AS A CULTURE, DO WE WANT
TO BE REMEMBERED FOR THIS?
IT'S HILARIOUS.
PEOPLE LAUGH
BECAUSE IT'S MORONIC.
NOT BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY.
THIS IS MAN LAW,
NOT CAVEMAN LAW.
HEY, HAVE YOU DONE IT? NO!
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
CRUSHING BEER CANS
ON YOUR FOREHEAD IS WRONG.
TRIPLE H IS RIGHT. CANS AIN'T
AS THICK AS THEY ONCE WERE.
I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY, YOU
CRUSH A CAN ON YOUR FOREHEAD,
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING,
BUT NOW--
IT'S LAME.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAN LAW?
[ Together ]
MAN LAW.
THE GREAT TASTE
OF MILLER LITE.
ALWAYS A GOOD CALL.
>> A'S TOOK AN 11 STRAIGHT 
WINNING STREAK INTO COLORADO. 
MATT HOLIDAY, HIS 15TH OF THE 
YEAR OFF HAREN. 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM HAD ALLOWED 14 
EARNED RUNS OVER HIS LAST THREE 
GAMES.
GETS NICK SWISHER THERE.
HE PITCHED SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS. 
ROCKIES GO UP 3-0 AND WOULD GO 
ON TO SHUT OUT THE A'S 7-0. 
SO OAKLAND'S 10-GAME WINNING 
STREAK IS SNAPPED.
IT'S THEIR WORST SHUTOUT LOSS 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2 OF LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY LOST 7-0 TO THE 
YANKEES.
MATT HOLLIDAY, BOY, HE'S BEEN 
INCREDIBLE, BATTING .479 OVER 
HIS LAST 12 GAMES 
>> FROM WHAT WAS THE HOTTEST 
TEAM IN BASEBALL TO THE BEST 
TEAM IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE.
EL DUQUE AND THE METS BEGINNING 
A FOUR-GAME SET AGAINST THE 
REDS. 
EL DUQUE GETTING KEN GRIFFEY 
JR., SEVEN K'S AND SEVEN STRONG 
FOR ORLANDO HERNTSDZ MANY -- 
HERNANDEZ.
HIS COUNTERPART FARING WELL, 
TOO.
KEN GRIFFEY JR., 440-FOOT 
BLAST.
2-1 CINCY YOUR SCORE. 
TOP EIGHT.
BASES LOADED FOR BRANDON 
PHILLIPS. 
THE DOUBLE WOULD SCORE ADAM 
DUNN AND AUSTIN KEARNS.
>> EL DUQUE, THE HARD-LUCK 
LOSER.
AS A DIAMONDBACK AND MET THIS 
SEASON HE IS 5-0 AT HOME. 
>> COMING OFF A FRANCHISE-TYING 
EIGHT HOME RUNS MONDAY, THE 
TIGERS WERE IN MILWAUKEE MONDAY 
NIGHT.
GREAT PITCHING MATCH. 
JEREMY BONDERMAN STRUCK OUT 12 
IN SEVEN INNINGS. 
HE'S PITCHED BACK-TO-BACK 12 X 
GAMES.
GETS GRANDERSON LOOKING.
THEN PLACIDO POLANCO. 
BOTTOM SEVEN, FIELDER OFF 
BONDERMAN.
HIS 14TH OF THE YEAR. 
THE BREWERS ARE UP 1-0. 
TOP EIGHT, TIED 1-1.
TWO ON MORE MAGGLIO ORDONEZ.
THAT ONE OFF THE RIGHT FIELD 
WALL. 
TWO RUNS SCORE. 
THE TIGERS WILL TAKE A 
THREE-RUN LEAD AND THAT WILL 
STAND YOU UP AS THE FINAL.
TIGERS HAVE WON FIVE STRAIGHT.
NINE OF THEIR LAST 10, 10 OF 
THEIR LAST 12.
BONDERMAN 5-0 ON THE ROAD THIS 
SEASON. 
THE TIGERS PROBABLY WISH THEY 
COULD PLAY ALL N.L. OPPONENTS 
THIS YEAR.
THEY'RE 6-1 THIS SEASON AGAINST 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OPPONENTS.
>> IS THIS THE WORST LOSS 
YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED?
>> NO, NO, WHEN I WAS 3 YEARS 
OLD AND PLAYING ON THE PEE-WEE 
TEAM WE GOT BEAT IN THE LAST 
SECOND. 
ASK ME A REAL [BEEP] QUESTION, 
OK? 
>> THE NBA HAS FINED MAVERICKS 
OWNER MARK CUBAN IN EXCESS OF 
$1 MILLION IN THE PAST MOSTLY 
FOR HIS CRITICISM OF 
OFFICIATING.
AFTER WHAT YOU JUST HEARD HE 
MAY BE RECEIVING ANOTHER LETTER 
IN THE MAIL.
BUT TIZZ TIME IN THE LEAGUE MAY 
BE DWINDLING. 
HE SUGGESTED MONDAY NIGHT IF HE 
DOESN'T SEE CHANGES IN THE 
LEAGUE HE WOULD CONSIDER 
SELLING THE MAVERICKS.
THEY WILL GET STACKHOUSE BACK 
FOR GAME SIX. 
AN EDGY STACK HAD A MESSAGE FOR 
SHAQ. 
>> I THINK HE MADE MORE OF IT 
THAN WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO P 
-- TO BE THE YOU DON'T WANT TO 
GET UP AND THROW NO BLOWS.
JUST KIND OF FIELD LED IT A 
LITTLE BIT. 
HE CAN GET CREDIT FOR HELPING 
ME FIELD IT.
>> JUST OUR ENERGY. 
ENERGY AND BEING A THREAT FOR 
US OFFENSIVELY, YOU KNOW, 
GIVING US ANOTHER TOUGH GUY OUT 
THERE THAT LIKES TO GET IN 
THERE AND MIX IT UP.
SO WE'LL GFT -- DEFINITELY 
WELCOME HIS TOUGHNESS BACK AND 
THE WAY HE SPACES THE FLOOR FOR 
US AND GETS THINGS DONE IN ONLY 
A STACKHOUSE WAY. 
>> THE NBA WISHED DIRK NOWITZKI 
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY MONDAY BY 
FINING HIM FIVE GRAND FOR 
KICKING THE BALL INTO THE 
STANDS FOLLOWING GAME FIVE. 
WITH AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AHEAD TO 
GAME SIX, WE SEND YOU TO 
DALLAS. 
>> HERE WITH TIM LEGLER AND 
GREG ANTHONY, WE GET YOU READY 
FOR GAME SIX. 
I'M NOT SURE AS WE STOOD HERE 
AFTER GAME TWO WE THOUGHT THERE 
WOULD EVEN BE A GAME SIX, AND 
WITH ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
IN GAME THREE WE CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T THINK THERE WOULD BE THE 
DO YOU THINK DALLAS THAT THE -- 
THOUGHT THINK HAD THIS WON IN 
GAME THREE? 
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
DOUBT, COMPLACENCY SAT IN AND 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THAT GAME 
OND -- AND THE SERIES IN THE 
BAG.
IT'S A LESSON LEARNED AND A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
>> I KNOW ALL THE TRIPS I TOOK 
TO SOUTH BEACH WHEN I PLAYED, 
WE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT TIME AS A 
TEAM. 
I DON'T THINK DALLAS HAD THAT 
MUCH FUN IN MIAMI.
THEY'RE VERY GLAD TO BE COMING 
HOPE. 
THIS TEAM'S BEEN VERY GOOD IN 
THIS BUILDING THIS YEAR AND 
THEY DID SOME THINGS WELL IN 
MIAMI, THEY JUST DIDN'T FINISH 
GAMES.
THEY MADE MISTAKES DURING 
CRITICAL STRETCHES OR THIS 
SERIES COULD BE OVER BY NOW.
>> THAT TIME PERIOD, THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES OF GAME THREE, 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN 
OUTSCORED BY 40 POINTS. 
WHAT'S GONG DOCTOR GONE WRONG 
FOR DALLAS? 
>> WELL, IF YOU GO BACK TO GAME 
FIVE, I DON'T FEEL THEY BLEW 
GAME FIVE.
THAT WAS THE HEAT WINNING.
GAME THREE, THAT'S ANOTHER 
STORY.
THEY BLEW THAT ONE. 
BUT THEIR PSYCHE IS GOING TO BE 
FINE. 
THEY'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. 
REMEMBER, THEY STILL HAD A 
CHANCE TO WIN GAME FIVE WITHOUT 
JERRY STACKHOUSE, THEIR MOST 
POTENT SCORER OFF THE BENCH AND 
LEADER. 
>> WE GOT TO GIVE DWYANE WADE A 
LOT OF CREDIT.
HE HAS PRETTY MUCH TAKEN OVER 
THIS SERIES.
BUT IF YOU'RE AVERY JOHNSON, 
ADJUSTMENTS AREN'T ENOUGH.
YOU GOT TO FLAT-OUT MAKE A 
DETERMINATION YOU'RE NOT GOING 
TO LOSE TO ONE GUY. 
DWYANE WADE WAS ALLOWED PRETTY 
MUCH WHERE HE WANTED TO GO IN 
THE FOURTH QUARTER. 
CANNOT DO THIS. 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS GUY 
MAKE PLAYS FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WHEN AVERY JOHNSON GOT OFF 
THE CHARTER, HE SAID IT'S SO 
GOOD TO BE BACK IN TEXAS, CAN'T 
WAIT TO HEAR OUR HOME FANS IN 
GAME SIX AND GAME SEVEN.
BACK TO UP. 
>> STILL TO COME ON ESPNEWS, 
ALEX RODRIGUEZ HAS STRUCK OUT

STRIKING OUT AGAINST PHILLY ON

SAME INNING, ABRAHAM NUNEZ, 
GREAT DIVING STOP FOR THE OUT.
YANKEES MANAGER JOE TORRE SAID 
THAT WAS THE PLAY OF THE GAME.
KYLE FARNSWORTH STRIKES HIM 
OUT, BUT THE BALL GETS PAST 
POSADA. 
AFTER THE INNING POSADA DID 
APOLOGIZE TO FARNSWORTH.
THAT SAYS IT ALL. 
THE YANKS HAVE LOST THREE IN A

(talk show host)
We're back with the GEICO Gecko.
(talk show host) So now here's
the thing I don't understand,
people could save...
hundreds of dollars on car
insurance by switching to GEICO.
Right.
(talk show host) So, I have to
ask, why does GEICO even need a
talking gecko?
Well, entertainment.
(talk show host)
How's that?
Look, you can't just tell
people that GEICO could
save'em money...
it's true, yes, but it's a bit
boring. So you...
have a little gecko
entertain, play a little
guitar or whatever.
They think they're watching
entertaining television, but
they're actually watching...
[whispering]
a commercial.
(male narrator)
GEICO. Fifteen minutes
could save you...
fifteen percent or
more on car insurance.

SPAIN IS INTO THE SECOND ROUND 
WITH A 3-1 WIN. 
SPAIN'S BEST START EVER
? 
HERE ARE A FEW AP HE'SIZERS 
GSHEAPTIZERS FOR WHAT YOU CAN 
EXPECT OVER THE NEXT HALF HOUR 
ON ESPNEWS. 
AVERY JOHNSON AND THE FIRED-UP 
MAVERICKS ARE BACK HOME.
WHY IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A HAPPY 
BIRTHDAY FOR DOUBTS DOUBTS. 
-- DIRK NOWITZKI. 
AND WHY PITTSBURGH POLICE ADDED 
INSULT TO INJURY FOR PITTSBURGH 
STEELERS Q.B. BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER ONE WEEK AFTER 
HIS MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT.
ONE -- NOW ON ESPNEWS.
>> WE WILL HAVE THAT TRIO OF 
STORIES AND MUCH MORE A LITTLE 
LATER ON ESPNEWS. 
LOS ANGELES MICHELLE BONNER I 
AM ANTHONY AMEY.
>> DATING BACK TO 1980 IN FINAL 
SERIES FOR THE NBA, NHL, AND 
MLB, THE HOME TEAM HAS WON A 
COMBINED 17 GAME SEVENS.
THAT SAID -- HURRICANES AND 
OILERS, GAME SEVEN FROM 
CAROLINA. 
CAROLINA TRYING TO BECOME THE 
FIRST EIGHT SEED TO WIN THE 
STANLEY CUP.
THE HOME TEAM IN THE NHL HAS 
WON THE LAST FIVE STANLEY CUPS. 
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES INTO THE 
GAME. 
PASS FROM BEHIND THE GOAL.
AARON WARD, THE WRISTER.
RIGHT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND THE 
CANES ARE UP EARLY. 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
FIVE GUYS.
RIGHT THROUGH THE DEFENSE THE 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR TO CRAIG ADAMS. 
ADAMS APPEARED TO SCORE.
IT'S RULED A NO-GOAL. 
STAIOS'S PAD POSITIONED THE 
PUCK, STOMACH DOES NOT TOUCH 
IT. 
NO GOAL ON THAT ONE.
>> SECOND PERIOD, MATT CULLEN 
FEEDING MARK REEK -- RECCHI 
SKATELE IN ON MARKKANEN, WHO 
PROVIDES THE BEAUTIFUL KICK 
SAVE. 
LESS THAN A MINUTE LATER, CANE

AND THE SCORE.
HE SCORES FOR THE FOURTH TIME 
THIS POSTSEASON.
THIRD PERIOD, 63 SECONDS INTO 
THE PERIOD, FERNANDO PISANI 
WITH HIS 14TH GOAL OF THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
HE LIT THE LAMP JUST 18 TIMES 
DURING THE ENTIRE REGULAR 
SEASON. 
CULTS THE LEAD TO 2-1.
LATER, RAFFI TORRES TAKING A 
SHOT OFF THE REBOUND. 
PISANI TRIES TO STUFF IT HOME 
BUT WARD DENIES HIM.
ONE OF 22 SAVES FOR THE ROOKIE. 
AND 3-1 FOR THE HURRICANES. 
THE OILERS OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL, 
COMING SO CLOSE.
AND CAPTAIN ROD BRIND'AMOUR 
AFTER 16 YEARS GETS TO HOST THE 
STANLEY CUP.
CAM WARD YOUR CONN SMYTHE 
WINNER. 
>> BRIND'AMOUR SAID AFTER GAME 
FIVE HE HAD A LUMP IN HIS 
CHEST.
THAT LUMP IS GONE.
CAM WARD ENDS UP WINNING MORE 
GAMES IN THE PLAYOFFS THAN IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON. 
THE HOME TEAM IMPROVES TO 12-2 
ALL-TIME IN GAME SEVENS OF THE 
FINALS.
>> THE PARADE FOR THEIR 
FIRST-EVER STANLEY CUP WILL BE 
THIS TUESDAY AND THEY WILL TAKE 
IT AROUND THEIR ARENA.
AS FOR THE ROOKIE, THE 
22-YEAR-OLD CAM WARD, THE CONN 
SMYTHE WINNER, HERE HE IS AFTER 
THE GAME. 
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S YOUR 
ROOKIE SEASON AND CHANCES ARE 
IT WILL COME AGAIN BUT YOU JUST 
NEVER KNOW. 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE CARE OF 
THE PRESENT AND TAKE OF THAT 
OPPORTUNITY.
AS FOR WES AND RODDY AND ALL 
THOSE VETERAN GUYS, DOUGIE, I 
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR THEM. 
>> WHEN YOU WORK, YOUR LIFE'S 
WORK IT -- IS TO TRY TO WIN A 
STANLEY CUP AND UP FALL SHORT 
LIKE WE DID TONIGHT, IT'S A 
DISAPPOINTMENT. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, PRETTY GOOD 
EFFORT. 
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
I GUESS TO WAIT 18 YEARS AND BE 
ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCE IT 
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NEVER 
-- IT WAS NEVER, EVER ABOUT ME. 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERY GUY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM.
>> AFTER GAME SIX I JUST KEPT 
THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN LET THIS GO, THERE'S TOO 
MANY GUYS THAT DESERVE THIS.
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S I GUESS 
WHEN IT ALL JUST CAME TO A 
HEAD, THAT EMOTION. 
>> IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER GAME SEVEN IN 
THE LAST 30 YEARS ONLY FOUR 
TEAMS HAVE PLAYED A GAME SEVEN 
IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS AFTER 
WINNING A GAME SEVEN IN THEIR 
CONFERENCE FINAL. 
ALL FOUR OF THOSE TEAMS DID GO 
ON TO WIN THE STANLEY CUP IN 
THAT DECISIVE SEVENTH GAME OF 
THE FINAL.
FOR MORE ON THIS GAME, HERE ARE 
STEVE LEVY AND BARRY MELROSE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAROLINA 
COLLAPSE OF ALL-TIME SPORTS.
IN THE END THE HURRICANES 
REBOUND FROM AN ALL OF GAME SIX 
TO WIN THE UP?
GAME SEVEN. 
>> AND THEY DID IT THE WAY 
EDMONTON GOT TO GAME SEVEN, 
WITH PASSION, SPEED, AND 
CHARACTER.
THEY CAME OUT WITH ENERGY, 
LOOKED FASTER AND HUNGRIER THAN 
THE EDMONTON OILERS.
GREAT JOCK BY PETER LAVIOLETTE 
GETTING THAT TEAM READY TO PLAY 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
AWESOME, AWESOME JOB BY 
EVERYBODY.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WARD 
BROTHERS. 
CARRY -- AARON WARD SCORING 
EARLY, NO RELATIONND -- AND CAM 
WARD. 
>> NOW HE'S GOT A STANLEY CUP 
RING, GOING TO WIN THE CONN 
SMYTHE. 
22 YEARS OLD. 
UNBELIEVABLE STORY. 
KID'S GOT ICE WATER IN HIS 
VEINS.
WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE 
PLAYOFFS WILL BE TALKED ABOUT 
FOR YEARS TO COME.
>> SMILES ALL OVER THE TRIANGLE 
REGION AND IF THE TRIANGLE HAD 
A FOURTH POINT THAT JUST MIGHT 
INCLUDE HARTFORD. 
MORE COMING UP LATER. 
BACK TO UP. 
>> WELL.
HURRICANES' WIN THIS BE IS THE 
SEVENTH TIME IN THE LAST 11 
SEASONS, OF COURSE NOT 
INCLUDING THE CANCELLED SEASON, 
THAT THE TEAM HAS WON THE 
STANLEY CUP AFTER THAT 
FRANCHISE HAS MOVED FROM ITS 
ORIGINAL LOCATION.
>> TO BASEBALL NOW. 
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO, THE GIANTS 
AND ANGELS BATTLED EACH OTHER.
MATT CAIN WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 
THEN. 
TOP FOUR, DEALING TO ORLANDO 
CABRERA.
CHONE FIGGINS STEALS SECOND.
ANGELS SCORE A RUN WITHOUT 
BENEFIT OF A HIT. 
TOP FOUR, GARRET ANDERSON, 
ROBBED BY MARK SWEENEY. 
CAIN HAD A NO-HITTER THROUGH 
FOUR. 
TOP FIVE, PROTECTING THAT 2-1 
LEAD. 
THE COUNT -- LAST GIANT TO HIT 
-- TOSS A NO-HITTER WAS IN 
1976. 
TOP SEVEN, MIKE NAPOLI. 
MORALES GOES DOWN.
BACK UP, BACK DOWN. 
STRIKES OUT THE SIDE IN SEVEN.
TOM EIGHT, TIM SALMON LOOKING.
CAREER HIGH 10 K'S FOR THE 
21-YEAR-OLD MATT CAIN.
HIS 128TH PITCH IS LINED INTO 
CENTER. 
THE NO-HIT BID IS OVER. 
THAT'S THE ONLY HIT HE ALLOWED 
IN EIGHT INNINGS OF WORK AS THE 
GIANTS GET THE 2-1 WIN. 
BEFORE THE GAME THE ASSOCIA
>> A'S TOOK AN 11 STRAIGHT 
WINNING STREAK INTO COLORADO. 
MATT HOLIDAY, HIS 15TH OF THE 
YEAR OFF HAREN. 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM HAD ALLOWED 14 
EARNED RUNS OVER HIS LAST THREE 
GAMES.
GETS NICK SWISHER THERE.
HE PITCHED SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS. 
ROCKIES GO UP 3-0 AND WOULD GO 
ON TO SHUT OUT THE A'S 7-0. 
SO OAKLAND'S 10-GAME WINNING 
STREAK IS SNAPPED.
IT'S THEIR WORST SHUTOUT LOSS 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2 OF LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY LOST 7-0 TO THE 
YANKEES.
MATT HOLLIDAY, BOY, HE'S BEEN 
INCREDIBLE, BATTING .479 OVER 
HIS LAST 12 GAMES 
>> FROM WHAT WAS THE HOTTEST 
TEAM IN BASEBALL TO THE BEST 
TEAM IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE.
EL DUQUE AND THE METS BEGINNING 
A FOUR-GAME SET AGAINST THE 
REDS. 
EL DUQUE GETTING KEN GRIFFEY 
JR., SEVEN K'S AND SEVEN STRONG 
FOR ORLANDO HERNTSDZ MANY -- 
HERNANDEZ.
HIS COUNTERPART FARING WELL, 
TOO.
KEN GRIFFEY JR., 440-FOOT 
BLAST.
2-1 CINCY YOUR SCORE. 
TOP EIGHT.
BASES LOADED FOR BRANDON 
PHILLIPS. 
THE DOUBLE WOULD SCORE ADAM 
DUNN AND AUSTIN KEARNS.
>> EL DUQUE, THE HARD-LUCK 
LOSER.
AS A DIAMONDBACK AND MET THIS 
SEASON HE IS 5-0 AT HOME. 
>> COMING OFF A FRANCHISE-TYING 
EIGHT HOME RUNS MONDAY, THE 
TIGERS WERE IN MILWAUKEE MONDAY 
NIGHT.
GREAT PITCHING MATCH. 
JEREMY BONDERMAN STRUCK OUT 12 
IN SEVEN INNINGS. 
HE'S PITCHED BACK-TO-BACK 12 X 
GAMES.
GETS GRANDERSON LOOKING.
THEN PLACIDO POLANCO. 
BOTTOM SEVEN, FIELDER OFF 
BONDERMAN.
HIS 14TH OF THE YEAR. 
THE BREWERS ARE UP 1-0. 
TOP EIGHT, TIED 1-1.
TWO ON MORE MAGGLIO ORDONEZ.
THAT ONE OFF THE RIGHT FIELD 
WALL. 
TWO RUNS SCORE. 
THE TIGERS WILL TAKE A 
THREE-RUN LEAD AND THAT WILL 
STAND YOU UP AS THE FINAL.
TIGERS HAVE WON FIVE STRAIGHT.
NINE OF THEIR LAST 10, 10 OF 
THEIR LAST 12.
BONDERMAN 5-0 ON THE ROAD THIS 
SEASON. 
THE TIGERS PROBABLY WISH THEY 
COULD PLAY ALL N.L. OPPONENTS 
THIS YEAR.
THEY'RE 6-1 THIS SEASON AGAINST 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OPPONENTS.
>> IS THIS THE WORST LOSS 
YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED?
>> NO, NO, WHEN I WAS 3 YEARS 
OLD AND PLAYING ON THE PEE-WEE 
TEAM WE GOT BEAT IN THE LAST 
SECOND. 
ASK ME A REAL [BEEP] QUESTION, 
OK? 
>> THE NBA HAS FINED MAVERICKS 
OWNER MARK CUBAN IN EXCESS OF 
$1 MILLION IN THE PAST MOSTLY 
FOR HIS CRITICISM OF 
OFFICIATING.
AFTER WHAT YOU JUST HEARD HE 
MAY BE RECEIVING ANOTHER LETTER 
IN THE MAIL.
BUT TIZZ TIME IN THE LEAGUE MAY 
BE DWINDLING. 
HE SUGGESTED MONDAY NIGHT IF HE 
DOESN'T SEE CHANGES IN THE 
LEAGUE HE WOULD CONSIDER 
SELLING THE MAVERICKS.
THEY WILL GET STACKHOUSE BACK 
FOR GAME SIX. 
AN EDGY STACK HAD A MESSAGE FOR 
SHAQ. 
>> I THINK HE MADE MORE OF IT 
THAN WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO P 
-- TO BE THE YOU DON'T WANT TO 
GET UP AND THROW NO BLOWS.
JUST KIND OF FIELD LED IT A 
LITTLE BIT. 
HE CAN GET CREDIT FOR HELPING 
ME FIELD IT.
>> JUST OUR ENERGY. 
ENERGY AND BEING A THREAT FOR 
US OFFENSIVELY, YOU KNOW, 
GIVING US ANOTHER TOUGH GUY OUT 
THERE THAT LIKES TO GET IN 
THERE AND MIX IT UP.
SO WE'LL GFT -- DEFINITELY 
WELCOM HIS TOUGHNESS BACK AND 
THE WAY HE SPACES THE FLOOR FOR 
US AND GETS THINGS DONE IN ONLY 
A STACKHOUSE WAY. 
>> THE NBA WISHED DIRK NOWITZKI 
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY MONDAY BY 
FINING HIM FIVE GRAND FOR 
KICKING THE BALL INTO THE 
STANDS FOLLOWING GAME FIVE. 
WITH AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AHEAD TO 
GAME SIX, WE SEND YOU TO 
DALLAS. 
>> HERE WITH TIM LEGLER AND 
GREG ANTHONY, WE GET YOU READY 
FOR GAME SIX. 
I'M NOT SURE AS WE STOOD HERE 
AFTER GAME TWO WE THOUGHT THERE 
WOULD EVEN BE A GAME SIX, AND 
WITH ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
IN GAME THREE WE CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T THINK THERE WOULD BE THE 
DO YOU THINK DALLAS THAT THE -- 
THOUGHT THINK HAD THIS WON IN 
GAME THREE? 
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
DOUBT, COMPLACENCY SAT IN AND 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THAT GAME 
OND -- AND THE SERIES IN THE 
BAG.
IT'S A LESSON LEARNED AND A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
>> I KNOW ALL THE TRIPS I TOOK 
TO SOUTH BEACH WHEN I PLAYED, 
WE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT TIME AS A 
TEAM. 
I DON'T THINK DALLAS HAD THAT 
MUCH FUN IN MIAMI.
THEY'RE VERY GLAD TO BE COMING 
HOPE. 
THIS TEAM'S BEEN VERY GOOD IN 
THIS BUILDING THIS YEAR AND 
THEY DID SOME THINGS WELL IN 
MIAMI, THEY JUST DIDN'T FINISH 
GAMES.
THEY MADE MISTAKES DURING 
CRITICAL STRETCHES OR THIS 
SERIES COULD BE OVER BY NOW.
>> THAT TIME PERIOD, THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES OF GAME THREE, 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN 
OUTSCORED BY 40 POINTS. 
WHAT'S GONG DOCTOR GONE WRONG 
FOR DALLAS? 
>> WELL, IF YOU GO BACK TO GAME 
FIVE, I DON'T FEEL THEY BLEW 
GAME FIVE.
THAT WAS THE HEAT WINNING.
GAME THREE, THAT'S ANOTHER 
STORY.
THEY BLEW THAT ONE. 
BUT THEIR PSYCHE IS GOING TO BE 
FINE. 
THEY'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. 
REMEMBER, THEY STILL HAD A 
CHANCE TO WIN GAME FIVE WITHOUT 
JERRY STACKHOUSE, THEIR MOST 
POTENT SCORER OFF THE BENCH AND 
LEADER. 
>> WE GOT TO GIVE DWYANE WADE A 
LOT OF CREDIT.
HE HAS PRETTY MUCH TAKEN OVER 
THIS SERIES.
BUT IF YOU'RE AVERY JOHNSON, 
ADJUSTMENTS AREN'T ENOUGH.
YOU GOT TO FLAT-OUT MAKE A 
DETERMINATION YOU'RE NOT GOING 
TO LOSE TO ONE GUY. 
DWYANE WADE WAS ALLOWED PRETTY 
MUCH WHERE HE WANTED TO GO IN 
THE FOURTH QUARTER. 
CANNOT DO THIS. 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS GUY 
MAKE PLAYS FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WHEN AVERY JOHNSON GOT OFF 
THE CHARTER, HE SAID IT'S SO 
GOOD TO BE BACK IN TEXAS, CAN'T 
WAIT TO HEAR OUR HOME FANS IN 
GAME SIX AND GAME SEVEN.
BACK TO UP. 
>> STILL TO COME ON ESPNEWS, 
ALEX RODRIGUEZ HAS STRUCK OUT 
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE. 
COULD HE KEEP THE YANKEES FROM 
STRIKING OUT AGAINST PHILLY ON 
MONDAY NIGHT? 
>> AND ONE WEEK AFTER THE 
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT WHICH 
HOSPITALIZED BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER, HE RECEIVED A 
NOT SO WELCOME NOTE IN FROM THE 
AUTHORITIES.
WE'LL EXPLAIN.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.
>> THE YANKEES' RANDY JOHNSON 
7-1 IN HIS LAST SEVEN STARTS AT 
PHILLY. 
PAT BURRELL DOWN THE LEFT-FIELD 
LINE. 
TWO RUNNERS SCORE.
PHILS UP 2-1. 
TOP FIVE, ALEX RODRIGUEZ UP 
AGAINST BRETT MYERS.
A-ROD BATTING .212 IN THE MONTH 
OF JUN 18 K'S.
YOU CAN MAKE IT 19. 
THAT ENDS THE THREAT. 
K'S 11 IN 6 2/3.
SAME INNING, ABRAHAM NUNEZ, 
GREAT DIVING STOP FOR THE OUT.
YANKEES MANAGER JOE TORRE SAID 
THAT WAS THE PLAY OF THE GAME.
KYLE FARNSWORTH STRIKES HIM 
OUT, BUT THE BALL GETS PAST 
POSADA. 
AFTER THE INNING POSADA DID 
APOLOGIZE TO FARNSWORTH.
THAT SAYS IT ALL. 
THE YANKS HAVE LOST THREE IN A 
ROW.
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, OR 
PERHAPS INJURY TO INSULT, 
OCTAVIO DOTEL'S COMEBACK TO 
REJOIN THE YANKS THIS WEEK HAS 
COME TO A HALT. 
HE HAS TENDINITIS.
>> WAIVED BY THE ROYALS FRIDAY, 
EMERGENCY STARTER KYLE SNYDER 
TOOK THE HILL AND HIS BOSTON 
DEBUT DIDN'T QUITE START OUT 
LIKE HE PLANNED.
JOSE VIDRO, SOLO JACK.
HIS FIFTH.
1-0, NATS.
GABE KAPLER SENDS ONE DEEP. 
AND OFF THE MONSTER.
KAPLER MAKING HIS SEASON DEBUT, 
COMING BACK FROM THAT ACHILLES 
INJURY. 
DOUBLES HOME COCO CRISP.
UP 5-3 WHEN MANNY RAMIREZ 
PROVIDES THE PUNTHWAKSE.
HOME RUN -- PUNCTCONTINUATION.
BOSTON NOW 6-1 IN INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY THIS YEAR.
>> LAST JULY, BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER TOLD ESPN HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET 
WHILE RIDING HIS MOTORCYCLE 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE LAW. 
AND IT'S NOT THE LAW, ONLY IF 
YOU HAVE A VALID LICENSE, WHICH 
HE DID NOT THE PITTSBURGH 
POLICE SAY ROETHLISBERGER WILL 
BE FINED $388 FOR RIDING 
WITHOUT A LICENSE AND NOT 
WEARING A HELMET. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THE WOMAN WHO 
HE CRASHED INTO WILL BE CITED 
FOR FAILING TO YIELD. 
SHE FILED A POLICE REPORT 
SAYING SHE'S BEEN RECEIVING 
THREATENING PHONE CALLS.
MONDAY, STEELERS COACH BILL 
COWHER TALKED FOR THE FIRST 
TIME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.
>> THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE 
LESSONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DEVASTATING, COULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY TRAGIC STORY.
BUT THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO 
WALK AWAY AND IT APPEARS AT 
THIS TIME THAT THERE COULD BE 
NO REAL LONG LINGERING EFFECTS, 
HE COULD BE A GREAT MENTOR. 
IT COULD BE A GREAT STORY AND 
MAYBE HAVE A LINGERING POSITIVE 
EFFECT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
ARE IN HIS POSITION AND HAD 
THAT VIEWPOINT PRIOR TO THIS 
ACCIDENT. 
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL 
TAKE FROM IT. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S A GROWN MAN AND HAS TO 
MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONS.
>> MEANWHILE, STEELERS ROOKIE 
RECEIVER SANTONIO HOLMES 
PLEADED NOT GUILTY MONDAY TO 
CHARGES OF ASSAULTING THE 
MOTHER OF ONE OF HIS CHILDREN.
THIS IS HIS SECOND ARREST SINCE 
BEING DRAFTED IN APRIL.

YOU KNOW THE OTHER TWO ROOKIE 
GOALIES WHO WON THE CONN 
SMYTHE? 
KEN DRYDEN AND PATRICK ROY. 
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU?

YOU CAN'T CHANGE
THE PRICE OF GAS.
BUT YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR FILTER.
REPLACING A CLOGGED AIR FILTER
CAN SAVE YOU UP TO $5
PER TANK OF GAS.
INSTALL A NEW FRAM AIR FILTER
EVERY 12,000 MILES.
IT CAN IMPROVE
YOUR CAR'S PERFORMANCE
AND SAVE YOU MONEY AT THE PUMP.
SO REMEMBER,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DRIVE,
NO MATTER HOW YOU DRIVE IT...

BEFORE YOU SLAM IT, FRAM IT.

COMING TO A DINNER TABLE
NEAR YOU!
IT'S HOT, IT'S STEAMY,

DALLAS. 
>> HERE WITH TIM LEGLER AND 
GREG ANTHONY, WE GET YOU READY 
FOR GAME SIX. 
I'M NOT SURE AS WE STOOD HERE 
AFTER GAME TWO WE THOUGHT THERE 
WOULD EVEN BE A GAME SIX, AND 
WITH ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
IN GAME THREE WE CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T THINK THERE WOULD BE THE 
DO YOU THINK DALLAS THAT THE -- 
THOUGHT THINK HAD THIS WON IN 
GAME THREE? 
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
DOUBT, COMPLACENCY SAT IN AND 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THAT GAME 
OND -- AND THE SERIES IN THE 
BAG.
IT'S A LESSON LEARNED AND A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
>> I KNOW ALL THE TRIPS I TOOK 
TO SOUTH BEACH WHEN I PLAYED, 
WE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT TIME AS A 
TEAM. 
I DON'T THINK DALLAS HAD THAT 
MUCH FUN IN MIAMI.
THEY'RE VERY GLAD TO BE COMING 
HOPE. 
THIS TEAM'S BEEN VERY GOOD IN 
THIS BUILDING THIS YEAR AND 
THEY DID SOME THINGS WELL IN 
MIAMI, THEY JUST DIDN'T FINISH 
GAMES.
THEY MADE MISTAKES DURING 
CRITICAL STRETCHES OR THIS 
SERIES COULD BE OVER BY NOW.
>> THAT TIME PERIOD, THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES OF GAME THREE, 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN 
OUTSCORED BY 40 POINTS. 
WHAT'S GONG DOCTOR GONE WRONG 
FOR DALLAS? 
>> WELL, IF YOU GO BACK TO GAME 
FIVE, I DON'T FEEL THEY BLEW 
GAME FIVE.
THAT WAS THE HEAT WINNING.
GAME THREE, THAT'S ANOTHER 
STORY.
THEY BLEW THAT ONE. 
BUT THEIR PSYCHE IS GOING TO BE 
FINE. 
THEY'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. 
REMEMBER, THEY STILL HAD A 
CHANCE TO WIN GAME FIVE WITHOUT 
JERRY STACKHOUSE, THEIR MOST 
POTENT SCORER OFF THE BENCH AND 
LEADER. 
>> WE GOT TO GIVE DWYANE WADE A 
LOT OF CREDIT.
HE HAS PRETTY MUCH TAKEN OVER 
THIS SERIES.
BUT IF YOU'RE AVERY JOHNSON, 
ADJUSTMENTS AREN'T ENOUGH.
YOU GOT TO FLAT-OUT MAKE A 
DETERMINATION YOU'RE NOT GOING 
TO LOSE TO ONE GUY. 
DWYANE WADE WAS ALLOWED PRETTY 
MUCH WHERE HE WANTED TO GO IN 
THE FOURTH QUARTER. 
CANNOT DO THIS. 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS GUY 
MAKE PLAYS FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WHEN AVERY JOHNSON GOT OFF

GOOD TO BE BACK IN TEXAS, CAN'T 
WAIT TO HEAR OUR HOME FANS IN 
GAME SIX AND GAME SEVEN.

GREAT DIVING STOP FOR THE OUT.
YANKEES MANAGER JOE TORRE SAID 
THAT WAS THE PLAY OF THE GAME.
KYLE FARNSWORTH STRIKES HIM 
OUT, BUT THE BALL GETS PAST 
POSADA. 
AFTER THE INNING POSADA DID 
APOLOGIZE TO FARNSWORTH.
THAT SAYS IT ALL. 
THE YANKS HAVE LOST THREE IN A

ROETHLISBERGER TOLD ESPN HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET 
WHILE RIDING HIS MOTORCYCLE 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE LAW. 
AND IT'S NOT THE LAW, ONLY IF 
YOU HAVE A VALID LICENSE, WHICH 
HE DID NOT THE PITTSBURGH 
POLICE SAY ROETHLISBERGER WILL 
BE FINED $388 FOR RIDING 
WITHOUT A LICENSE AND NOT 
WEARING A HELMET. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THE WOMAN WHO 
HE CRASHED INTO WILL BE CITED 
FOR FAILING TO YIELD. 
SHE FILED A POLICE REPORT 
SAYING SHE'S BEEN RECEIVING 
THREATENING PHONE CALLS.
MONDAY, STEELERS COACH BILL 
COWHER TALKED FOR THE FIRST 
TIME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.
>> THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE 
LESSONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DEVASTATING, COULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY TRAGIC STORY.
BUT THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO 
WALK AWAY AND IT APPEARS AT 
THIS TIME THAT THERE COULD BE 
NO REAL LONG LINGERING EFFECTS, 
HE COULD BE A GREAT MENTOR. 
IT COULD BE A GREAT STORY AND 
MAYBE HAVE A LINGERING POSITIVE 
EFFECT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
ARE IN HIS POSITION AND HAD 
THAT VIEWPOINT PRIOR TO THIS 
ACCIDENT. 
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL 
TAKE FROM IT. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S A GROWN MAN AND HAS TO 
MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONS.

I GUESS TO WAIT 18 YEARS AND BE 
ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCE IT 
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NEVER

I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERY GUY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM.
>> AFTER GAME SIX I JUST KEPT 
THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN LET THIS GO, THERE'S TOO 
MANY GUYS THAT DESERVE THIS.
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S I GUESS 
WHEN IT ALL JUST CAME TO A 
HEAD, THAT EMOTION.

WHEN YOU CONSIDER GAME SEVEN IN 
THE LAST 30 YEARS ONLY FOUR 
TEAMS HAVE PLAYED A GAME SEVEN

MONDAY, STEELERS COACH BILL 
COWHER TALKED FOR THE FIRST 
TIME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.
>> THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE 
LESSONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DEVASTATING, COULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY TRAGIC STORY.
BUT THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO 
WALK AWAY AND IT APPEARS AT 
THIS TIME THAT THERE COULD BE 
NO REAL LONG LINGERING EFFECTS, 
HE COULD BE A GREAT MENTOR. 
IT COULD BE A GREAT STORY AND 
MAYBE HAVE A LINGERING POSITIVE 
EFFECT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
ARE IN HIS POSITION AND HAD 
THAT VIEWPOINT PRIOR TO THIS 
ACCIDENT. 
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL 
TAKE FROM IT. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S A GROWN MAN AND HAS TO 
MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONS.

M.V.P. OF THE STANLEY CUP 
PLAYOFFS. 
CAM WARD SPOKE WITH STEVE LEVY 
AND BARRY MELROSE FOLLOWING THE 
GAME SEVEN WIN. 
>> WHAT YOU GOT THERE, CAM? 
>> THE CONN SMYTHE. 
AND I KNOW IT'S A HUGE HONOR TO 
RECEIVE THE AWARD.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU COULD 
HAVE GIVEN IT TO ANYBODY ON OUR 
TEAM. 
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT'S 
QUITE IRRELEVANT TO THE TROPHY 
THAT REALLY MATTERS, THE 
STANLEY CUP.
>> CONN SMYTHE, PLAYOFF M.V.P.
LET'S LUN -- RUN THROUGH THE 
CHECKLIST.
YOU'RE 22 YEARS OLD, STANLEY

WINNER. 
WHO'S GOT EAU -- A BETTER LIFE 
THAN YOU DO?
>> I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE AND 
COULDN'T BE DOING IT WITH A 
BETTER GROUP OF GUYS. 
THEY'VE BEEN OUTSTANDING AND 
BROUGHT ME TO THIS POINT. 
>> HOW MANY OF YOUR BUDDIES 
BACK IN SHERWOOD PARK PICKED 
YOU IN THEIR PLAYOFF POOL AT 
THE START OF THE PLAYOFFS?
>> NOT TOO MANY OF THEM!
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW THE OTHER TWO ROOKIE 
GOALIES WHO WON THE CONN 
SMYTHE? 
KEN DRYDEN AND PATRICK ROY. 
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU?
>> I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. 
IT'S A HUGE HONOR TO BE PUT IN 
THE SAME CATEGORIES AS THOSE 
GUYS. 
FOR OUR AUDIENCE IN THE STATES, 
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THAT 
FAMILIAR WITH SHERWOOD PARK.
THAT'S IN EDMONTON. 
ARE THEY GOING TO LET YOU BACK 
IN? 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I'M GOING TO BE EXCITED TO GO 
BACK. 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY, FRIENDS FOR 
THE MOST PART ARE TORN BEING 
FANS OF THE OILERS BUT THEY

THIS YEAR. 
P THAT'S NEXT.

(crowd cheering)
THEY SHOULD CALL ME
"MR. POINTS" I HAVE SO MANY.
- I JUST GOT UPGRADED.
- THEY'RE THE BEST.
- I GOT A CORDLESS DRILL
WITH SOME OF MY POINTS.
- REALLY?
- Man: YEAH. 
- I GOT THESE GOLF CLUBS.
- THOSE ARE GORGEOUS.
- THEY'RE MADE OF GOLD.
WOW, THAT'S TERRIFIC.
- I GOT A UNICYCLE
FOR MY SON.
- OH YEAH?
- SO MUCH FUN.
- WHAT, IS HE A CLOWN
OR SOMETHING?
- I HOPE SO. YEAH.
- GOOD FOR HIM.
I DON'T HAVE
ANY POINTS, SO...
THAT MAKES IT HARDER
TO REDEEM THEM. 
( laughs )
IT SURE DOES.
I'M THINKING ABOUT
GETTING A 10-GALLON HAT,
MAYBE SOME NUNCHUCKS.
GAME SEVENS.
THAT SAID -- HURRICANES AND 
OILERS, GAME SEVEN FROM 
CAROLINA. 
CAROLINA TRYING TO BECOME THE 
FIRST EIGHT SEED TO WIN THE 
STANLEY CUP.
THE HOME TEAM IN THE NHL HAS 
WON THE LAST FIVE STANLEY CUPS. 
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES INTO THE 
GAME. 
PASS FROM BEHIND THE GOAL.
AARON WARD, THE WRISTER.
RIGHT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND THE 
CANES ARE UP EARLY. 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
FIVE GUYS.
RIGHT THROUGH THE DEFENSE THE 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR TO CRAIG ADAMS. 
ADAMS APPEARED TO SCORE.
IT'S RULED A NO-GOAL. 
STAIOS'S PAD POSITIONED THE 
PUCK, STOMACH DOES NOT TOUCH 
IT. 
NO GOAL ON THAT ONE.
>> SECOND PERIOD, MATT CULLEN 
FEEDING MARK REEK -- RECCHI 
SKATELE IN ON MARKKANEN, WHO 
PROVIDES THE BEAUTIFUL KICK 
SAVE. 
LESS THAN A MINUTE LATER, CANE 
ON THE POWER PLAY.
FRANK KABERLE WITH THE SLAPSHOT 
AND THE SCORE.
HE SCORES FOR THE FOURTH TIME 
THIS POSTSEASON.
THIRD PERIOD, 63 SECONDS INTO 
THE PERIOD, FERNANDO PISANI 
WITH HIS 14TH GOAL OF THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
HE LIT THE LAMP JUST 18 TIMES 
DURING THE ENTIRE REGULAR 
SEASON. 
CULTS THE LEAD TO 2-1.
LATER, RAFFI TORRES TAKING A 
SHOT OFF THE REBOUND. 
PISANI TRIES TO STUFF IT HOME 
BUT WARD DENIES HIM.
ONE OF 22 SAVES FOR THE ROOKIE. 
AND 3-1 FOR THE HURRICANES. 
THE OILERS OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL, 
COMING SO CLOSE.
AND CAPTAIN ROD BRIND'AMOUR 
AFTER 16 YEARS GETS TO HOST THE 
STANLEY CUP.
CAM WARD YOUR CONN SMYTHE 
WINNER. 
>> BRIND'AMOUR SAID AFTER GAME 
FIVE HE HAD A LUMP IN HIS 
CHEST.
THAT LUMP IS GONE.
CAM WARD ENDS UP WINNING MORE 
GAMES IN THE PLAYOFFS THAN IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON. 
THE HOME TEAM IMPROVES TO 12-2 
ALL-TIME IN GAME SEVENS OF THE 
FINALS.
>> THE PARADE FOR THEIR 
FIRST-EVER STANLEY CUP WILL BE 
THIS TUESDAY AND THEY WILL TAKE 
IT AROUND THEIR ARENA.
AS FOR THE ROOKIE, THE 
22-YEAR-OLD CAM WARD, THE CONN 
SMYTHE WINNER, HERE HE IS AFTER 
THE GAME. 
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S YOUR 
ROOKIE SEASON AND CHANCES ARE 
IT WILL COME AGAIN BUT YOU JUST 
NEVER KNOW. 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE CARE OF 
THE PRESENT AND TAKE OF THAT 
OPPORTUNITY.
AS FOR WES AND RODDY AND ALL 
THOSE VETERAN GUYS, DOUGIE, I 
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR THEM. 
>> WHEN YOU WORK, YOUR LIFE'S 
WORK IT -- IS TO TRY TO WIN A 
STANLEY CUP AND UP FALL SHORT 
LIKE WE DID TONIGHT, IT'S A 
DISAPPOINTMENT. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, PRETTY GOOD 
EFFORT. 
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
I GUESS TO WAIT 18 YEARS AND BE 
ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCE IT 
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NEVER 
-- IT WAS NEVER, EVER ABOUT ME. 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERY GUY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM.
>> AFTER GAME SIX I JUST KEPT 
THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN LET THIS GO, THERE'S TOO 
MANY GUYS THAT DESERVE THIS.
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S I GUESS 
WHEN IT ALL JUST CAME TO A 
HEAD, THAT EMOTION. 
>> IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER GAME SEVEN IN 
THE LAST 30 YEARS ONLY FOUR 
TEAMS HAVE PLAYED A GAME SEVEN 
IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS AFTER 
WINNING A GAME SEVEN IN THEIR 
CONFERENCE FINAL. 
ALL FOUR OF THOSE TEAMS DID GO 
ON TO WIN THE STANLEY CUP IN 
THAT DECISIVE SEVENTH GAME OF 
THE FINAL.
FOR MORE ON THIS GAME, HERE ARE 
STEVE LEVY AND BARRY MELROSE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAROLINA 
COLLAPSE OF ALL-TIME SPORTS.
IN THE END THE HURRICANES 
REBOUND FROM AN ALL OF GAME SIX 
TO WIN THE UP?
GAME SEVEN. 
>> AND THEY DID IT THE WAY 
EDMONTON GOT TO GAME SEVEN, 
WITH PASSION, SPEED, AND 
CHARACTER.
THEY CAME OUT WITH ENERGY, 
LOOKED FASTER AND HUNGRIER THAN 
THE EDMONTON OILERS.
GREAT JOCK BY PETER LAVIOLETTE 
GETTING THAT TEAM READY TO PLAY 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
AWESOME, AWESOME JOB BY 
EVERYBODY.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WARD 
BROTHERS. 
CARRY -- AARON WARD SCORING 
EARLY, NO RELATIONND -- AND CAM 
WARD. 
>> NOW HE'S GOT A STANLEY CUP 
RING, GOING TO WIN THE CONN 
SMYTHE. 
22 YEARS OLD. 
UNBELIEVABLE STORY. 
KID'S GOT ICE WATER IN HIS 
VEINS.
WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE 
PLAYOFFS WILL BE TALKED ABOUT 
FOR YEARS TO COME.
>> SMILES ALL OVER THE TRIANGLE 
REGION AND IF THE TRIANGLE HAD 
A FOURTH POINT THAT JUST MIGHT 
INCLUDE HARTFORD. 
MORE COMING UP LATER. 
BACK TO UP. 
>> WELL.
HURRICANES' WIN THIS BE IS THE 
SEVENTH TIME IN THE LAST 11 
SEASONS, OF COURSE NOT 
INCLUDING THE CANCELLED SEASON, 
THAT THE TEAM HAS WON THE 
STANLEY CUP AFTER THAT 
FRANCHISE HAS MOVED FROM ITS 
ORIGINAL LOCATION.
>> TO BASEBALL NOW. 
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO, THE GIANTS 
AND ANGELS BATTLED EACH OTHER.
MATT CAIN WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 
THEN. 
TOP FOUR, DEALING TO ORLANDO 
CABRERA.
CHONE FIGGINS STEALS SECOND.
ANGELS SCORE A RUN WITHOUT 
BENEFIT OF A HIT. 
TOP FOUR, GARRET ANDERSON, 
ROBBED BY MARK SWEENEY. 
CAIN HAD A NO-HITTER THROUGH 
FOUR. 
TOP FIVE, PROTECTING THAT 2-1 
LEAD. 
THE COUNT -- LAST GIANT TO HIT 
-- TOSS A NO-HITTER WAS IN 
1976. 
TOP SEVEN, MIKE NAPOLI. 
MORALES GOES DOWN.
BACK UP, BACK DOWN. 
STRIKES OUT THE SIDE IN SEVEN.
TOM EIGHT, TIM SALMON LOOKING.
CAREER HIGH 10 K'S FOR THE 
21-YEAR-OLD MATT CAIN.
HIS 128TH PITCH IS LINED INTO 
CENTER. 
THE NO-HIT BID IS OVER. 
THAT'S THE ONLY HIT HE ALLOWED 
IN EIGHT INNINGS OF WORK AS THE 
GIANTS GET THE 2-1 WIN. 
BEFORE THE GAME THE ASSOCIA;/
>> A'S TOOK AN 11 STRAIGHT 
WINNING STREAK INTO COLORADO. 
MATT HOLIDAY, HIS 15TH OF THE 
YEAR OFF HAREN. 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM HAD ALLOWED 14 
EARNED RUNS OVER HIS LAST THREE 
GAMES.
GETS NICK SWISHER THERE.
HE PITCHED SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS. 
ROCKIES GO UP 3-0 AND WOULD GO 
ON TO SHUT OUT THE A'S 7-0. 
SO OAKLAND'S 10-GAME WINNING 
STREAK IS SNAPPED.
IT'S THEIR WORST SHUTOUT LOSS 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2 OF LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY LOST 7-0 TO THE 
YANKEES.
MATT HOLLIDAY, BOY, HE'S BEEN 
INCREDIBLE, BATTING .479 OVER 
HIS LAST 12 GAMES 
>> FROM WHAT WAS THE HOTTEST 
TEAM IN BASEBALL TO THE BEST 
TEAM IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE.
EL DUQUE AND THE METS BEGINNING 
A FOUR-GAME SET AGAINST THE 
REDS. 
EL DUQUE GETTING KEN GRIFFEY 
JR., SEVEN K'S AND SEVEN STRONG 
FOR ORLANDO HERNTSDZ MANY -- 
HERNANDEZ.
HIS COUNTERPART FARING WELL, 
TOO.
KEN GRIFFEY JR., 440-FOOT 
BLAST.
2-1 CINCY YOUR SCORE. 
TOP EIGHT.
BASES LOADED FOR BRANDON 
PHILLIPS. 
THE DOUBLE WOULD SCORE ADAM 
DUNN AND AUSTIN KEARNS.
>> EL DUQUE, THE HARD-LUCK 
LOSER.
AS A DIAMONDBACK AND MET THIS 
SEASON HE IS 5-0 AT HOME. 
>> COMING OFF A FRANCHISE-TYING 
EIGHT HOME RUNS MONDAY, THE 
TIGERS WERE IN MILWAUKEE MONDAY 
NIGHT.
GREAT PITCHING MATCH. 
JEREMY BONDERMAN STRUCK OUT 12 
IN SEVEN INNINGS. 
HE'S PITCHED BACK-TO-BACK 12 X 
GAMES.
GETS GRANDERSON LOOKING.
THEN PLACIDO POLANCO. 
BOTTOM SEVEN, FIELDER OFF 
BONDERMAN.
HIS 14TH OF THE YEAR. 
THE BREWERS ARE UP 1-0. 
TOP EIGHT, TIED 1-1.
TWO ON MORE MAGGLIO ORDONEZ.
THAT ONE OFF THE RIGHT FIELD 
WALL. 
TWO RUNS SCORE. 
THE TIGERS WILL TAKE A 
THREE-RUN LEAD AND THAT WILL 
STAND YOU UP AS THE FINAL.
TIGERS HAVE WON FIVE STRAIGHT.
NINE OF THEIR LAST 10, 10 OF 
THEIR LAST 12.
BONDERMAN 5-0 ON THE ROAD THIS 
SEASON. 
THE TIGERS PROBABLY WISH THEY 
COULD PLAY ALL N.L. OPPONENTS 
THIS YEAR.
THEY'RE 6-1 THIS SEASON AGAINST 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OPPONENTS.
>> IS THIS THE WORST LOSS 
YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED?
>> NO, NO, WHEN I WAS 3 YEARS 
OLD AND PLAYING ON THE PEE-WEE 
TEAM WE GOT BEAT IN THE LAST 
SECOND. 
ASK ME A REAL [BEEP] QUESTION, 
OK? 
>> THE NBA HAS FINED MAVERICKS 
OWNER MARK CUBAN IN EXCESS OF 
$1 MILLION IN THE PAST MOSTLY 
FOR HIS CRITICISM OF 
OFFICIATING.
AFTER WHAT YOU JUST HEARD HE

BUT TIZZ TIME IN THE LEAGUE MAY 
BE DWINDLING. 
HE SUGGESTED MONDAY NIGHT IF HE 
DOESN'T SEE CHANGES IN THE 
LEAGUE HE WOULD CONSIDER 
SELLING THE MAVERICKS.
THEY WILL GET STACKHOUSE BACK 
FOR GAME SIX. 
AN EDGY STACK HAD A MESSAGE FOR

>> LAST JULY, BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER TOLD ESPN HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET 
WHILE RIDING HIS MOTORCYCLE 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE LAW. 
AND IT'S NOT THE LAW, ONLY IF 
YOU HAVE A VALID LICENSE, WHICH 
HE DID NOT THE PITTSBURGH 
POLICE SAY ROETHLISBERGER WILL 
BE FINED $388 FOR RIDING 
WITHOUT A LICENSE AND NOT 
WEARING A HELMET. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THE WOMAN WHO 
HE CRASHED INTO WILL BE CITED

SHE FILED A POLICE REPORT 
SAYING SHE'S BEEN RECEIVING 
THREATENING PHONE CALLS.
MONDAY, STEELERS COACH BILL 
COWHER TALKED FOR THE FIRST 
TIME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.
>> THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE 
LESSONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DEVASTATING, COULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY TRAGIC STORY.
BUT THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO 
WALK AWAY AND IT APPEARS AT 
THIS TIME THAT THERE COULD BE 
NO REAL LONG LINGERING EFFECTS, 
HE COULD BE A GREAT MENTOR. 
IT COULD BE A GREAT STORY AND 
MAYBE HAVE A LINGERING POSITIVE 
EFFECT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
ARE IN HIS POSITION AND HAD 
THAT VIEWPOINT PRIOR TO THIS 
ACCIDENT. 
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL 
TAKE FROM IT. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S A GROWN MAN AND HAS TO 
MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONS.
>> MEANWHILE, STEELERS ROOKIE 
RECEIVER SANTONIO HOLMES 
PLEADED NOT GUILTY MONDAY TO 
CHARGES OF ASSAULTING THE 
MOTHER OF ONE OF HIS CHILDREN.
THIS IS HIS SECOND ARREST SINCE

GAME SEVENS.
THAT SAID -- HURRICANES AND 
OILERS, GAME SEVEN FROM 
CAROLINA. 
CAROLINA TRYING TO BECOME THE 
FIRST EIGHT SEED TO WIN THE 
STANLEY CUP.
THE HOME TEAM IN THE NHL HAS 
WON THE LAST FIVE STANLEY CUPS. 
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES INTO THE 
GAME. 
PASS FROM BEHIND THE GOAL.
AARON WARD, THE WRISTER.
RIGHT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND THE 
CANES ARE UP EARLY. 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
FIVE GUYS.
RIGHT THROUGH THE DEFENSE THE 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR TO CRAIG ADAMS. 
ADAMS APPEARED TO SCORE.
IT'S RULED A NO-GOAL. 
STAIOS'S PAD POSITIONED THE 
PUCK, STOMACH DOES NOT TOUCH 
IT. 
NO GOAL ON THAT ONE.
>> SECOND PERIOD, MATT CULLEN 
FEEDING MARK REEK -- RECCHI 
SKATELE IN ON MARKKANEN, WHO 
PROVIDES THE BEAUTIFUL KICK 
SAVE. 
LESS THAN A MINUTE LATER, CANE 
ON THE POWER PLAY.
FRANK KABERLE WITH THE SLAPSHOT 
AND THE SCORE.
HE SCORES FOR THE FOURTH TIME 
THIS POSTSEASON.
THIRD PERIOD, 63 SECONDS INTO 
THE PERIOD, FERNANDO PISANI 
WITH HIS 14TH GOAL OF THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
HE LIT THE LAMP JUST 18 TIMES 
DURING THE ENTIRE REGULAR 
SEASON. 
CULTS THE LEAD TO 2-1.
LATER, RAFFI TORRES TAKING A 
SHOT OFF THE REBOUND. 
PISANI TRIES TO STUFF IT HOME 
BUT WARD DENIES HIM.
ONE OF 22 SAVES FOR THE ROOKIE. 
AND 3-1 FOR THE HURRICANES. 
THE OILERS OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL, 
COMING SO CLOSE.
AND CAPTAIN ROD BRIND'AMOUR 
AFTER 16 YEARS GETS TO HOST THE 
STANLEY CUP.
CAM WARD YOUR CONN SMYTHE 
WINNER. 
>> BRIND'AMOUR SAID AFTER GAME 
FIVE HE HAD A LUMP IN HIS 
CHEST.
THAT LUMP IS GONE.
CAM WARD ENDS UP WINNING MORE 
GAMES IN THE PLAYOFFS THAN IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON. 
THE HOME TEAM IMPROVES TO 12-2 
ALL-TIME IN GAME SEVENS OF THE 
FINALS.
>> THE PARADE FOR THEIR 
FIRST-EVER STANLEY CUP WILL BE 
THIS TUESDAY AND THEY WILL TAKE 
IT AROUND THEIR ARENA.
AS FOR THE ROOKIE, THE 
22-YEAR-OLD CAM WARD, THE CONN 
SMYTHE WINNER, HERE HE IS AFTER 
THE GAME. 
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S YOUR 
ROOKIE SEASON AND CHANCES ARE 
IT WILL COME AGAIN BUT YOU JUST 
NEVER KNOW. 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE CARE OF 
THE PRESENT AND TAKE OF THAT 
OPPORTUNITY.
AS FOR WES AND RODDY AND ALL 
THOSE VETERAN GUYS, DOUGIE, I 
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR THEM. 
>> WHEN YOU WORK, YOUR LIFE'S 
WORK IT -- IS TO TRY TO WIN A 
STANLEY CUP AND UP FALL SHORT 
LIKE WE DID TONIGHT, IT'S A 
DISAPPOINTMENT. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, PRETTY GOOD 
EFFORT. 
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
I GUESS TO WAIT 18 YEARS AND BE 
ABLE TO OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCE IT 
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NEVER 
-- IT WAS NEVER, EVER ABOUT ME. 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERY GUY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM.
>> AFTER GAME SIX I JUST KEPT 
THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN LET THIS GO, THERE'S TOO 
MANY GUYS THAT DESERVE THIS.
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S I GUESS 
WHEN IT ALL JUST CAME TO A 
HEAD, THAT EMOTION. 
>> IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER GAME SEVEN IN 
THE LAST 30 YEARS ONLY FOUR 
TEAMS HAVE PLAYED A GAME SEVEN 
IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS AFTER 
WINNING A GAME SEVEN IN THEIR 
CONFERENCE FINAL. 
ALL FOUR OF THOSE TEAMS DID GO 
ON TO WIN THE STANLEY CUP IN 
THAT DECISIVE SEVENTH GAME OF 
THE FINAL.
FOR MORE ON THIS GAME, HERE ARE 
STEVE LEVY AND BARRY MELROSE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAROLINA 
COLLAPSE OF ALL-TIME SPORTS.
IN THE END THE HURRICANES 
REBOUND FROM AN ALL OF GAME SIX 
TO WIN THE UP?
GAME SEVEN. 
>> AND THEY DID IT THE WAY 
EDMONTON GOT TO GAME SEVEN, 
WITH PASSION, SPEED, AND 
CHARACTER.
THEY CAME OUT WITH ENERGY, 
LOOKED FASTER AND HUNGRIER THAN 
THE EDMONTON OILERS.
GREAT JOCK BY PETER LAVIOLETTE 
GETTING THAT TEAM READY TO PLAY 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
AWESOME, AWESOME JOB BY 
EVERYBODY.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WARD 
BROTHERS. 
CARRY -- AARON WARD SCORING 
EARLY, NO RELATIONND -- AND CAM 
WARD. 
>> NOW HE'S GOT A STANLEY CUP 
RING, GOING TO WIN THE CONN 
SMYTHE. 
22 YEARS OLD. 
UNBELIEVABLE STORY. 
KID'S GOT ICE WATER IN HIS 
VEINS.
WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE 
PLAYOFFS WILL BE TALKED ABOUT 
FOR YEARS TO COME.
>> SMILES ALL OVER THE TRIANGLE 
REGION AND IF THE TRIANGLE HAD 
A FOURTH POINT THAT JUST MIGHT 
INCLUDE HARTFORD. 
MORE COMING UP LATER. 
BACK TO UP. 
>> WELL.
HURRICANES' WIN THIS BE IS THE 
SEVENTH TIME IN THE LAST 11 
SEASONS, OF COURSE NOT 
INCLUDING THE CANCELLED SEASON, 
THAT THE TEAM HAS WON THE 
STANLEY CUP AFTER THAT 
FRANCHISE HAS MOVED FROM ITS 
ORIGINAL LOCATION.
>> TO BASEBALL NOW. 
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO, THE GIANTS 
AND ANGELS BATTLED EACH OTHER.
MATT CAIN WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 
THEN. 
TOP FOUR, DEALING TO ORLANDO 
CABRERA.
CHONE FIGGINS STEALS SECOND.
ANGELS SCORE A RUN WITHOUT 
BENEFIT OF A HIT. 
TOP FOUR, GARRET ANDERSON, 
ROBBED BY MARK SWEENEY. 
CAIN HAD A NO-HITTER THROUGH 
FOUR. 
TOP FIVE, PROTECTING THAT 2-1 
LEAD. 
THE COUNT -- LAST GIANT TO HIT 
-- TOSS A NO-HITTER WAS IN 
1976. 
TOP SEVEN, MIKE NAPOLI. 
MORALES GOES DOWN.
BACK UP, BACK DOWN. 
STRIKES OUT THE SIDE IN SEVEN.
TOM EIGHT, TIM SALMON LOOKING.
CAREER HIGH 10 K'S FOR THE 
21-YEAR-OLD MATT CAIN.
HIS 128TH PITCH IS LINED INTO 
CENTER. 
THE NO-HIT BID IS OVER. 
THAT'S THE ONLY HIT HE ALLOWED 
IN EIGHT INNINGS OF WORK AS THE 
GIANTS GET THE 2-1 WIN. 
BEFORE THE GAME THE ASSOCIA
>> A'S TOOK AN 11 STRAIGHT 
WINNING STREAK INTO COLORADO. 
MATT HOLIDAY, HIS 15TH OF THE 
YEAR OFF HAREN. 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM HAD ALLOWED 14 
EARNED RUNS OVER HIS LAST THREE 
GAMES.
GETS NICK SWISHER THERE.
HE PITCHED SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS. 
ROCKIES GO UP 3-0 AND WOULD GO 
ON TO SHUT OUT THE A'S 7-0. 
SO OAKLAND'S 10-GAME WINNING 
STREAK IS SNAPPED.
IT'S THEIR WORST SHUTOUT LOSS 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2 OF LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY LOST 7-0 TO THE 
YANKEES.
MATT HOLLIDAY, BOY, HE'S BEEN 
INCREDIBLE, BATTING .479 O
[
AND MIAMI ON WINS AGAIN TO TAKE
HE 
FIRST BEG HEADLINE. 
THE NEXT ONE, JERRY STACKHOUSE 
RETURNS AFTER HIS GAME FIVE 
SUSPENSION. 
AND MARK CUBAN DENIES A "MIAMI 
HERALD REPORT" THAT HE SAID 
THAT THE LEAGUE WAS RIGGED.
[CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY 
ESPN, INC.]
HI THERE. 
I'M JOSH ELLIOTT. 
WELCOME TO THE "HOTLIST." 
WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF. 
YOU WILL BE WITH US UNTIL 2:55 
WHEN WE GO WAY TO THE ENGLAND 
CUP LIST. 
YOU GET FOUR HOURS OF THE 
"HOTLIST" TODAY.
BECAUSE IT IS, INDEED HOT.
JERRY STACKHOUSE, AGAIN, BACK, 
AND THE BIG NEWS TODAY, MARK 
CUBAN IN A "MIAMI HERALD 
REPORT" REPORTEDLY YELLED AT 
DAVID STERN THAT THE LEAGUE IS 
RIGGED. 
HE IS DENYING THAT ON HIS BLOG.
>> THE NBA FINALS TAKING CENTER 
STAGE.
THE MAVS SO DOMINANT FOR THE 
FIRST TWO PLUS GAME NOW DOWN 
3-2, TRYING TO CHANGE THE 
MOMENTUM AND FORCE GAME SEVEN.
HOW DO THEY DO IT?
DOES MIAMI END IT ALL TONIGHT?
FOR THE BIG QUESTIONS, WE ASK 
OUR EXPERTS IN DALLAS, TIM 
LEGLER AND GARY.
>> WHAT IS DALLAS' MINDSET? 
>> I THINK THAT FIRST AND 
FOREMOST THEY HAVE A RELIEF 
THAT THEY'RE OUT OF SOUTH 
BEACH.
IT WAS ROUGH THERE. 
THEY HAVE TWO CHANCES TO WIN 
THIS AT HOME WHERE THEY HAVEN'T 
LOST TO THE MIAMI HEAT. 
I THINK FROM THAT STANDPOINT 
THEY'RE CONFIDENT.
THEY DID A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT 
IN MIAMI. 
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO FINISH 
GAMES OUT AND SOME OF THE 
DECISIVE GAMES. 
THEY DIDN'T COME UP ON THE 
WINNING END.
THEY CAN TURN THAT AROUND IN 
THIS BUILDING.
MORE THAN ANYTHING, THEY'RE 
GLAD TO BE BACK HOME AND HAVE A 
CHANCE TO FORCE GAME SEVEN IF 
THEY CAN GET ONE TONIGHT. 
>> DIRK NOWITZKI, KEET HERE FOR 
DALLAS, HE SEEMS -- THE KEY 
HERE FOR DALLAS.
HE SEEMS TO NEED TO TAKE OVER.
DIRK NOWITZKI SPOKE TO FEELING 
THE PRESSURE IN GAME ONE AND 
GAME TWO. 
WHAT CAN HE DO TO GAIN CONTROL? 
>> HE HAS TO GET OVER THE 
FRUSTRATIONS AND THE 
DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE GAME FIVE 
LOSS. 
I THINK THAT YOU WILL SEE HIM.
YOU SAW THE LAST 2 1/2 MINUTES, 
I THINK THAT DIRK NOWITZKI GOT 
A RHYTHM. 
DWAYNE WADE TALKED ABOUT AFTER 
GAME TWO, HE GOT HIS RHYTHM.
SAW SIMILAR INSTANCES FROM DIRK 
NOWITZKI DOWN THE STRETCH OF 
GAME FIVE WHERE HE WAS NOT ONLY 
ABLE TO MAKE PLAYS TO CREATE 
OFFENSE FOR HIMSELF AND MAKE 
PLAYS OFF THE DRIBBLE, WHICH IS 
PROBABLY HIS BIGGEST WEAKNESS 
AND SOMETHING THAT MIAMI HAS 
BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. 
I THINK THAT HE WILL BE IN 
TUNE, IN RHYTHM TONIGHT.
COMING BACK HOME. 
LOSING THREE OF THOSE GAMES IN 
MIAMI THAT THEY FELT THAT THEY 
COULD HAVE OR SHOULD HAVE WON.
HE IS THE KEY.
HE IS THE ONE GUY THAT MIAMI 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO BOTTLE UP. 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE DALLAS 
MAVERICKS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO DOT SAME. 
DWAYNE WADE HAS NOT BEEN AS 
EFFECTIVE IN DALLAS.
HE WILL HAVE TO MATCH THE 
INTENSITY THAT I WOULD 
ASUPERTHAT DIRK WILL BRING 
TONIGHT.
>> THE REFEREING FOR BETTER OR 
WORSE SEEMS TO FAVOR THE HOME 
TEAM. 
HOW DOES THAT IMPACT WHAT MIAMI 
WANTS TO DO TONIGHT?
>> THE REASON THAT IT FAVORED 
MIAMI IN SOUTH BEACH IS BECAUSE 
MIAMI IS THE MORE AGGRESSIVE 
TEAM. 
THEY'RE GOING INSIDE TO SHAQ. 
THAT WILL DRAW FOULS. 
DWAYNE WADE HAS BEEN PLAYING A 
LOT OF SINGLE COVERAGE OUT ON 
THE PERIMETER.
I THINK THAT THE REFEREES ARE 
CALLING IT UP ON THE TEAM THAT 
IS MORE AGGRESSIVE. 
YOU COME BACK TO THIS BUILDING 
AND DALLAS HAS TO REVERSE THAT. 
THE MIAMI HEAT HAVE SHOT MORE 
FREE THROWS A GAME. 
THAT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME.
THAT ALLOWS MIAMI TO GET BACK 
AND SET UP THE HALF-COURT 
DEFENSE.
SO DALLAS HAS TO REVERSE THE 
TREND.
THEY HAVE TO GET TO THE RIM.
COME OUT DEFENSIVELY, WHICH I 
EXPECT THEM TO BE IN THIS 
BUILDING WITH THE HOME CROWD 
AND ADRENALINE, THEY WILL BE 
BETTER BEINGS QUICKER.
I THINK THAT YOU WILL SEE THEM 
-- BETTER, QUICK ARE. 
I THINK YOU WILL SEE THEM COME 
OUT STRONGER. 
>> AND MARK CUBAN WAS SAID TO 
HAVE SAID THAT -- TO DAVID 
STERN SAYING THAT THE LEAGUE IS 
RIGGED AND NOW CUBAN IS FIND 
$250,000. 
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?
>> IF WHAT WAS SAID WAS TRUE 
ABOUT MARK CUBAN AND HIS 
COMMENTS, THEN THAT'S THE RIGHT 
TASK TO TAKE FOR THE LEAGUE.
MARK CUBAN, AS FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WHETHER IT BE PLAYERS 
COACHES ORPHANS WERE EMOTIONAL 
AFTER THAT GAME.
IT WAS A DIFFICULT LOSS TO HAVE 
TO SWALLOW. 
A DIFFICULT PAIN TO ENDURE. 
I DON'T THINK THAT IT IS AS 
MUCH OF AN ISSUE AS TO WHAT 
WILL GO ON TONIGHT. 
THIS IS ABOUT THE PLAYERS AND 
COACHES ON THE FLOOR, NOT MARK 
CUBAN.
THE FOCUS HAS TO REMAIN THERE.
I THINK THAT YOU WILL SEE GREAT 
EFFFRT FOR BOTH TEAMS.
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
MIAMI TO WIN FOR THE FIRST TIME 
FOR THAT FRANCHISE. 
THEY WANT TO WIN THIS GAME. 
THEY COULD DEFINITELY BE 
HOISTED THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
TROPHY AT THE END OF THE NIGHT. 
>> TIM, AGAIN, MARK CUBAN, 
PERHAPS IF THIS WERE COMING 
FROM A DIFFERENT OWNER, IF THE 
MAVERICKS WEREN'T USED TO 
SEEING THEIR OWNER SO HANDS ON 
AND IN THE FACE OF DAVID STERN, 
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THAT 
FINE IS NOT FOR SUGGESTING THE 
LEAGUE WAS RIGGED, BUT FOR 
REPEATED ACTS OF VIOLATING THE 
CODE REPEATEDLY.
DO YOU AGREE WITH GREG? 
DO YOU SEE THIS BEING A 
DISTRACTION TONIGHT?
>> I DON'T THINK THAT IT IS.
IN PART IT IS SITUATION GONE JG 
WITH THE TEAM AND WITH THE 
OWNER.
I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING THEY 
LIKE THE FACT THAT MARK CUBAN 
IS AS HANDS ON AS HE IS.
HE IS AS SUPPORTIVE AS HE IS, 
AND WILL DO WHAT HE HAS TO 
BRING A WIN TO THE CITY.
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL 
LET THAT DISTRACT THEM ON THE 
COURT.
IN SOME WAYS MARK CUBAN TAKES 
THE SPOTLIGHT ON HIMSELF AND 
OFF OF HIS TEAM WHICH, RIGHT 
NOW IS KIND OF REELING. 
THEY LOST THREE STRAIGHT GAMES. 
THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH A WIN 
IF THEY WANT TO EXTEND IT TO A 
GAME SEVEN. 
MARK CUBAN HAS DEFLECTED THAT 
ON TO HIMSELF.
I DON'T THINK THAT THE PLAYERS 
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT AT ALL. 
HE'S JUST STANDING UP FOR HIS 
TEAM. 
>> ONE OF THE BIG PLUSES FOR 
THE MAV SINCERE A BENCH THAT 
GOES 10 -- MAVS IS A BENCH THAT 
GOES 10 DEEP. 
AND THEY GET BACK JERRY 
STACKHOUSE TONIGHT. 
HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE 
MAVRICKS? 
>> IT CHANGES THEM NOT JUST 
OFFENSIVELY, BUT DEFENSIVELY. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE FELT IT WAS 
UNWARRANTED TO BE SUSPENDED FOR 
THAT FIFTH GAME IF YOU'RE JERRY 
STACKHOUSE, YOU'RE SAYING TO 
YOURSELF, IF I'M THERE, WE WIN. 
I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT 
THAT HE TRY NOT TO DO TOO MUCH 
TOO SOON AND LET THE GAME 
DICTATE WHAT HIS ROLE WILL BE.
HE WILL BE FEATURED 
OFFENSIVELY.
THEY LOOK FOR HIM TO PROVIDE 
LEADERSHIP IN SCORING.
BUT ALSO HE'S A SOLID REBOUNDER 
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A BIG 
FACTOR FOR THE MIAMI HEAT.
THAT ALLOWED THEM TO WIN GAME 
FIVE. 
THEY DID A GREAT JOB ON THE 
BACK BOARD. 
IF THEY BRING THAT ENERGY, I 
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MIAMI WILL 
BEAT THEM IF THEY CAN DOMINATE 
THE GLASS THE WAY THEY DID IN 
GAME FIVE.
>> TIM LEGLER, GREG ANTHONY, WE 
APPRECIATE T INSIGHTS TODAY.
>> ALL RIGHT. 
>> WE HAVE LOTS MORE COMING U 
ON THE "HOTLIST," INCLUDING -- 
THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING 
MARK CUBAN. 
NOW FINED, IT WAS ANNOUNCED, 
$250,000 FOR REPEATED ACTS OF 
MISCONDUCT. 
MARK STIPE WILL HAVE THE LATEST 
FROM -- MARC STEIN WILL HAVE 
THE LATEST FROM DALLAS.
THE ROLE THE TWO COACHES HAVE 
PLAYED. 
WE HAVE GREAT ONE FOR YOU NEXT 
ON THE "HOTLIST." 
FIRST, SEARCH SPORTSNATION.
D-THE HOITHOIT
SO MATER, NOW THAT
YOU'RE A BIG STAR...
YOU'RE GONNA NEED AN AGENT.
YEAH McQUEEN. TO GET ME INTO
ALL THEM BIG PARTIES...
AND FIND ME A SHACK
IN THE HILLS.
AHH...
[ SFX: CRASH ]
HEY, I CAN'T SEE...
WHOA...
ACTUALLY, YOU NEED A DIFFERENT
KIND OF AGENT.
MAYBE A GOOD NEIGHBOR.
CALL A STATE FARM AGENT...
AND GET THE GOOD NEIGHBOR
SERVICE YOU CAN COUNT ON...
ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.
AND CHECK OUT "CARS" THE
NEW DISNEY-PIXAR FILM...
ONLY IN THEATERS.
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.
( sultry music playing )
IS IT POSSIBLE

AN ENTIRELY NEW ES.
THE LEXUS ES 350.
MEN OF THE SQUARE TABLE,
WHEN TOASTING,
DO WE CLINK TOPS
OR BOTTOMS?
LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK.
HMMM.
IF THE TOPS TOUCH,
THEN OUR SALIVA IS TOUCHING.
WELL, THEN TECHNICALLY
THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS A KISS.
OH, COME ON!
TELL YOU WHAT,
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TOUCH BOTTOMS.
NO, THANKS, HOLLYWOOD.
I AIN'T INTO THAT.
BOTTLES.
MAN LAW?
[ Together ]
MAN LAW.
THE GREAT TASTE
OF MILLER LITE.
ALWAYS A GOOD CALL.
>> I THINK THAT HE MADE MORE OF 
IT THAN WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO 
BE. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BLOW NO 
BLOWS.
JUST KIND OF FELT IT A LITTLE 
BIT.
HE CAN GET SOME CREDIT FOR 
HELPING FEEL IT.
>> JUST ENERGY. 
ENERGY AND BEING A THREAT FOR 
US OFFENSIVELY. 
YOU KNOW GIVING US ANOTHER 
TOUGH GUY OUT THERE THAT LIKES 
TO GET IN THERE AND MIX IT UP.
WE'LL WELCOME HIS TOUGHNESS 
BACK AND THE WAY THAT HE GETS 
THINGS DONE IN ONLY A 
STACKHOUSE WAY. 
>> SO WE SAW JERRY STACKHOUSE 
BACK. 
HE IS BACK AFTER A GAME 
SUSPENSION FOR FIVE.
HE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S DOING AN 
AVERY JOHNSON IMPERSONATION TO 
ME. 
WHAT IMPACT WILL JERRY 
STACKHOUSE WILL HAVE. 
WE'LL JOINED BY OUR VERY 
ESTEEMED EXPERT HERE, PAUL 
SILAS.
JERRY STACKHOUSE BACK FOR GAME 
SIX.
HOW IMPORTANT IS IN HIS RETURN? 
>> THEY'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO 
WELCOME HIM BACK. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE AVERAGES 13 
POINTS A GAME.
HE CAN BREAK THE DEFENSE DOWN 
WHERE NO OTHER PLAYERS ON THEIR 
TEAM CAN BASICALLY DO THAT 
EXCEPT FOR DEVON HARRIS, AND HE 
IS STILL TRYING TO FIND HIS 
WAY.
HAVING STACKHOUSE BACK I THINK 
WILL PAY BIG DIVIDENDS. 
AS AVERY SAID, HE IS A TOUGH 
GUY.
HE CAN SPACE THE DEFENSE. 
IF HIS JUMP SHOT IS ON, THEN HE 
CAN CERTAINLY GO TO THE HOOP 
AND CAUSE HAVOC.
I LIKE THE FACT THAT HE IS BACK 
AND I THINK THAT IT DEFINITELY 
GIVES DALLAS AN EDGE TONIGHT. 
>> YOU'RE WONDERING HOW MUCH HE 
WAS MISSED IN GAME FIVE.
A BRUTAL GAME FIVE LOSS FOR 
DALLAS. 
IT IS COMFORTABLE IN OUR NEWS 
ROOM, BUT I WILL SEND YOU BACK 
TO GAME FIVE. 
TELL ME THIS, FIRST OF ALL, 
LATE IN THE GAME, DWAYNE WADE, 
WITH THE BALL, DRIVING. 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE FOUL 
CALL? 
>> IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
CALLED. 
THE REFEREE WHO CALLED IT WAS 
LIKE 30 FEET FROM THE BASKET. 
HE SLITHERED THROUGH. 
MAYBE THERE WAS A BUMP HERE OR 
THERE.
BUT, LISTEN, GUYS THIS IS THE 
NBA FINALS. 
YOU DO NOT CALL THAT PLAY THAT 
THE PARTICULAR TIME.
I DON'T THINK THAT HE WAS HIT 
THAT MUCH AT ALL. 
TO ME IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
CALLED. 
BUT IT WAS. 
LIVE WITH IT AND GO ON FROM 
THERE.
I THINKS THAT WHAT AVERY WILL 
DO. 
>> THE FREE THROW DIFFERENTIAL 
BETWEEN DALLAS AND MIAMI WAS 
HUGE FROM A PLUS THREE TO A 
MINUS 38. 
AS A COACH, HOW DO YOU KEEP 
YOUR TEAM FOCUSING ON WHAT THE 
REFS ARE OR ARE NOT CALLING?
>> YOU DO NOT FOCUS OP 
REFEREES. 
ANY TIME THAT YOU SEE GUYS 
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE REFEREES 
ALWAYS, YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE 
ON WHAT YOU NEED TO GET DONE AS 
A TEAM. 
THAT IS YOUR OFFENSIVE 
EXECUTION, DEFENSIVE EXECUTION, 
THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE 
CONTROL OVER. 
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE 
REFEREES, THEY'RE A NECESSARY 
EVIL. 
THEY'RE OUT THERE.
THEY'RE DOING THE BEST JOB THEY 
CAN AND THEY DO.
VERY SELDOM DO THEY GET CALLS 
WRONG AND IT IS WRONG TO ZERO 
IN ON THEM AND I'M SURE THAT 
AVERY WILL NOT LET HIS PLAYERS 
DO THAT.
>> WE MOVE ALONG AFTER THE 
FIRST MADE FREE THROW.
JOSH HOWARD CALLING A TIME-OUT. 
ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ANYTHING 
ABOUT BASKETBALL KNOWS HE MENTS 
AFTER THE SECOND FREE THROW -- 
KNOWS HE MEANT AFTER THE SECOND 
FREE THROW. 
>> I THINK IF YOU HAD A MORE 
EXPERIENCED REFEREE, THE GUY 
THAT CALLED IT, HE IS 
EXPERIENCED BUT NOT AS 
EXPERIENCED AS SOME OF THE 
OLDER GUYS, THEY PROBABLY WOULD 
HAVE LOOKED TO AVERY JOHNSON, 
AVERY, ARE YOU GOING TO CALL 
THIS TIME-OUT RIGHT NOW?
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT JOSH HOWARD 
WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT AVERY 
JOHNSON.
THE REFEREE SAID HE ASKED HIM, 
DO YOU REALLY WANT THIS 
TIME-OUT. 
IF THAT IS THE CASE, HE HAS TO 
CALL A TIME-OUT.
HAVING SAID THAT, IT IS JUST 
HORRIBLE, TO ME TO LOSE GAME 
THAT WAY. 
THEY HAD A CHANCE TO GET A SHOT 
OFF WITH 1.8 SECONDS ON THE 
CLOCK AT MID QUART. 
THERE WAS NO CHANCE THAT THEY 
WERE GOING TO MAKE THAT OUT TO 
WHERE THEY HAD TO TAKE THE CALL 
OUT FROM. 
IT WAS A HORRIBLE SITUATION.
AS A COACH, I FELT FOR AVERY. 
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
>> A HORRIBLE SITUATION IN 
AMONGST A HORRIBLE WEEK THERE 
IN MIAMI. 
AVERY JOHNSON PERHAPS CRACKING 
UNDER THE PRESSURE THAT HE 
MOVES HIS TEAM. 
MOVES HIS TEAM WAY OUT OF TOWN. 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIS 
DECISION TO MOVE HIS TEAM.
KEEP THEM IN THE AREA, BUT MOVE 
THEM SO FAR AWAY. 
>> I LIKED IT.
IF HE COULD HAVE MOVED THEM TO 
DALLAS, HE WOULD HAVE MOVED 
THEM TO DALLAS AND THEN COME 
BACK. 
THEY HAD PLENTY OF ENOUGH TIME. 
BUT YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON YOUR 
TEAM. 
YOUR TEAM HAS TO FOCUS. 
BECAUSE THEY HAD LOST TWO 
TOUGH, TOUGH GAMES. 
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE WON THE 
GAME NUMBER THEE. 
GAME FOUR WAS A GAME -- NUMBER 
3.
GAME FOUR WAS A GAME THAT THEY 
DID NOT WIN, THEY GOT FLOWN 
BLOWN AWAY. 
YOU WANT THEM TO BOND TOGETHER. 
HAVING THEM ROOM TOGETHER?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
THAT WAS A BIT MUCH.
>> ARMSTRONG GOT TO ENJOY A LOT 
OF GERMAN RAP.
THE HEAT LOOKING WITH FIVE SOME 
ODD MINUTES LEFT, HIS TEAM IS 
DOWN THREE, ALL OF A SUDDEN HE 
PULLS A RABBIT OUT OF A HAT AND 
NOW HE HAS HIS GUYS UP 3-2. 
WHAT EFFECT HAS PAT RILEY HAD 
ON THIS REVERSAL OF FORTUNE?
>> PAT RILEY MADE SOME GREAT 
ADJUSTMENTS AND THE FIRST THING 
HE DID WAS TAKE HASLEM FROM THE 
KEY AND PUT HIM ON THE LOW 
SIDE. 
AND HE OPENED IT UP WHERE 
DWAYNE WADE IS GETTING THE BALL 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT NOW 
AND HE'S ABLE TO GO BOTH WAYS 
AND I KEPT SAYING SEND THIS GUY 
LEFT. 
SEND THIS GUY LEFT. 
WELL, HE'S GOING LEFT AND 
FINISHING AS HE GOES. 
DWAYNE WADE IS ALMOST 
UNSTOPPABLE.
THE GUY IS A BONA FIDE 
SUPERSTAR AT THAT POINT AND I 
BELIEVE THAT'S WHY HE GOT THE 
CALL. 
>> THE CHESS MATCH CONTINUES 
TONIGHT.
GAME SIX. 
COVERAGE STARTING ON ABC AT 
8:30. 
COACH SILAS, AS ALWAYS, WE 
APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT. 
>> THANKS.

>> WELCOME BACK TO THE 
"HOTLIST."
>> I THINK THAT HE'S SMART. 
HIS RECENT LOSS OF SELF-CONTROL 
IS NOT PLANNED. 
I THINK THAT IF HE COULD, HE 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT BACK. 
AT THE BOTTOM I DO BELIEVE IT 
DISTRACTS THE PLAYERS AND THAT 
CAN'T BE GOOD.
IT SETS A BAD TONE. 
HE'S VERY SMART.
HE HAS TO TAKE CREDIT AND 
SHOULD BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR 
PUTTING TOGETHER AT GREAT TEAM. 
BOUGHT TIMES I THINK THAT HE 
LOSES CONTROL THAN HAD IS NOT 
HEALTH -- BUT AT TIMES I THINK 
THAT HE LOSES CONTROL AND THAT 
IS NOT HEALTHY FOR THE TEAM.
A BUSY OFF DAY FOLLOWING THE 
HEAT VICTORY. 
WE WELCOME ESPN'S MARC STEIN. 
THE NBA FINING CUBAN $250,000, 
THEY SAY NOT FOR THE QUOTE 
SAYING THAT THE LEAGUE IS 
RIGGED. 
MARC, YOUR REACTION IT THE 
FINE? 
>> I THINK THAT HE GOT A 
$200,000 FINE AND HE WENT ON TO 
A COURT AND CHALLENGED THE 
REF'S CALL. 
AND THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THIS 
SCENE.
CUBAN DID GO IN THE GENERAL 
DIRECTION OF WHERE STERN WAS 
SITTING AND SAY SOMETHING.
HE DID SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE 
SAN ANTONIO SERIES. 
STERN SAT RIGHT BEHIND THE MAIN 
PRESS SECTION AND CUBAN 
APPROACHED HIM IN THAT SCENARIO 
AS WELL.
I WOULD SAY THAT THE LEAGUE 
USED THAT $200,000 FIGURE AND 
RAMPED IT UP A BIT. 
>> WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT DOES 
NOT COME UP TO THE HEAVIEST 
FINE EVER LEVIED OF $500,000. 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS, WHAT 
IMPACT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT 
WILL HAVE?
>> THINK BY OUT IN LEAGUE IS 
ALMOST USED TO IT.
THE FINE OBVIOUSLY GETS 
PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. 
BUT MARC HAS TO BE APPROACHING 
THE $2 MILLION FIGURE IN FINES 
NOW.
I COVERED MARK SINCE HE HAS 
BEEN IN DALLAS. 
HE IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE 
OFFICIATING.
THE MAVRICKS FEEL -- THAT 
BASICALLY THEY CAN'T BREATHE ON 
DWAYNE WADE, BUT MIAMI CAN BE 
MUCH MORE PHYSICAL WITH 
NOWITZKI. 
I KNOW THAT THE MAVS QUARREL 
AND THEY DID NOT HANDLE THAT 
GAME FIVE LOSS. 
WELL, YOU CAN'T REACT THE WAY 
THAT THEY DID.
IT WAS A JOHN MCENROW-ESQUE 
SCENE.
I THINK THAT -- I DON'T THINK 
THAT THIS IS SOME DOOM'S DAY 
SCENARIO FOR THE LEAGUE AT THT 
POINT.
>> YOU HAVE COVERED THE 
MAVERICKS FOR MANY YEAR.
YOU LOOK AT A TEAM THAT WAS 
FIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM BEING UP 
3-0 AND THE JERRY STACKHOUSE 
SUSPENSION AND THE MOVE OF 
HOTELS AND THE WAY THAT GAME 
FIVE ENDED. 
WHAT IS THE MAVS' MINDSET NOW?
>> TWO THINGS WORKING IN THEIR 
FAVOR.
GAME FIVE ENDED IN A FASHION 
THAT THEY CAN USE IT AS AN US 
AGAINST THE WORLD SCENARIO. 
AND THE STACKHOUSE SUSPENSION 
MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE MAVS TO 
RATIONALIZE THE LOSS. 
IF THEY WOULD HAVE HAD ALL OF 
THEIR GUNS, IT MIGHT BE HARDER 
TO BOUNCE BACK. 
THAT GAME THREE LOSS, THEY WERE 
SIX MINUTES AWAY FROM A 3-0 
POSITION, YOU WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT THE HEAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN SWEEP VICTIMS.
AND FOR IT TO UNRAVEL ON THEM 
NOW IS A DIFFICULT BOUNCE BACK 
PROPOSITION.
IT IS THE BIGGEST TURNAROUND, 
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO COMEBACKS 
FROM 2-0 DOWN.
PORTLAND, IT IS THE ONLY TIME 
THAT PORTLAND WON TWO GAMES 
AFTER PORTLAND WON TWO. 
THE SIXERS WERE NEVER CLOSE IN 
THAT SERIES TO GETTING INTO A 
3-0 POSITION LIKE THE MAVS 
WERE. 
>> THEY GET JERRY STACKHOUSE 
BACK, BUT THIS MAY BEGIN AND OR 
END WITH DIRK NOWITZKI. 
HE SPOKE TO FEELING THE 
PRESSURE BEFORE GAME ONE. 
HE'S HAD AN UP AND DOWN FINALS 
PERFORMANCE.
WHAT DIRK NOWITZKI DO YOU 
EXPECT TO SEE COME GAME SIX?
>> HE HAS TO BE AGGRESSIVE. 
THAT'S WHAT HIS COACHES ARE 
TELLING HIM.
HAVING COVERED NOWITZKI 
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER AND 
THROUGHOUT THE PLAYOFFS WHEN HE 
WAS ESSENTIAL, THE THANK HE 
REALLY DID WAS ATTACK THE RIM 
HARDER THAN HE EVER HAS, 
TALKING TO PEOPLE AROUND THE 
MAVS, STAFF MEMBERS, THE 
CONCERN IS NOWITZKI AND THE 
MAVS DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE 
GOING TO GET THE CALL THE SAME 
WAY THAT DWAYNE WADE IS.
BUT THEY HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH 
THAT NOW, FORGET IT AND PUT THE 
ONUS ON THE REFS, IF DIRK KEEPS 
GOING TO THE RIM, I THINK THAT 
HE WILL GET THE CALLS.
THAT IS THE MAVS' MAIN QUARREL. 
THEY FEEL THAT THE GAMES ARE 
BEING OFFICIATED DIFFERENTLY 
YOU SEE IT WHEN NOWITZKI 
CATCHES THE BALL. 
BEFORE HE CATCHES THE BALL, HE 
IS ON THE MOVE. 
HE IS GETTING CONTACT BEFORE HE 
GETS THE BALL IN HIS HAND.
>> GAME SIX, A TITLE HANGS IN 
THE BALANCE.

>> WELCOME BACK TO THE 
"HOTLIST".
HERE ARE OUR TOP STORIES AS OF 
THIS MINUTE.
GAME SIX TONIGHT.
>> BEN ROETHLISBERGER WAS AT 
STEELERS TEAM COMPLEX FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE THE JUNE 12 
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT THAT LANDED 
HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.
HE DIDN'T TAKE PART IN ANY 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BUT DID PICK 
UP MAIL AND ATHLETIC GEAR.
THE TEAM IS OPTIMISTIC THAT BEN 
WILL BE READY TO GO FOR THE 
OPENER ON SEPTEMBER 7.
GERMANY AND ECUADOR, GERMANY 
PUNCHED ITS TICKET TO THE 
SECOND ROUND.
THE BALL INTO THE BOX.
HAMMERS THAT INTO THE CORNER. 
THAT IS THE GOAL. 
THAT'S THE FLIP.
44TH MINUTE.
FLICKED INTO THE BOX. 
BEATING THE DEFENDER. 
THAT IS HIS SECOND GOAL OF THE 
MATCH.
SECOND HALF ACTION, 57TH 
MINUTE. 
FINISHING WITH THE LEFT FOOT. 
GERMANY WINNING 3-0, GIVING 
THEM THE MAXIMUM NINE POINTS. 
GERMANY OFF TO ITS BEST WORLD 
CUP START IN THREE YEARS.
POLAND AND COASTA WREAKA, 
NEITHER OF THESE -- COSTA 
WREAKA -- COSTA RICA, NEITHER 
OF THESE TEAMS CAN ADVANCE. 
33RD MINUTE, POLAND IN WHITE. 
DOWN 1-0. 
THE CORNER KICK.
VOLLEYING THAT ONE IN.
POLAND TYING IT AT 1-0. 
THE GOALIE TRIPPED UP.
COULD HAVE BEEN A FOUL. 
INSTEAD GAME TIED AT 1-1. 
THE HEADER AT THE FAR POST. 
POLAND WINNING 2-1. 
ITS FIRST VICTORY OF 2006.
THIS IS COSTA RICA'S THIRD CUP 
LOSS. 
POLAND AND COSTA RICA HAVE BEEN 
ELIMINATED FROM THE WORLD CUP.
>> THE NBA SEASON, WELL, IT 
COULD END TONIGHT.
GAME SIX OF THE NBA FINALS, 
AFTER TWO GAMES, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WONDERED IF THE SERIES 
CAN GET BACK TO DALLAS. 
NOW THEY WONDER CAN THE MAVS 
FORCE A GAME SEVEN. 
WE WELLDOM B.J. ARMSTRONG AND 
DEE BROWN.
THANK GOD WE HAVE EXPERTS TO 
HELP US SORT ALL OF THIS. 
EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG 
FOR DALLAS, DID.
IF YOU'RE A MAVS' PLAYER, WHAT 
IS YOUR MINDSET NOW AND HOW DO 
YOU GET IT BACK TO WHAT YOU HAD 
GOING IN GAMES ONE AND TWO? 
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT GAME 
SIX IS COMING.
THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU CAN 
DO OTHER THAN TO BE THERE.
GAME SIX IS ALL THAT MATTERS. 
I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS THAT 
BAD OF A SHOWING IN MIAMI.
THEY GAVE THEMSELVES 
OPPORTUNITIES.
BUT THEY WERE OPPORTUNITIES 
THAT WERE LOST DUE TO MENTAL 
COLLAPSES THAT THEY HAD.
GOING BACK TO GAME SIX, THEY 
HAVE A CHANCE.
I'M SURE THAT THEY ARE FEELING 
GOOD. 
GOING BACK HOME IS ALWAYS A 
POSITIVE SIGN.
DOING WHAT THEY CAN DO TO GET 
BACK ON THE AGGRESSIVE. 
THEY NEED TO BE THE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE TEAM THAN THEY WERE. 
I THOUGHT THAT THEY MADE A 
GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
REBOUNDING. 
SO LOOK FOR GAME SIX TO BE A 
GAME THAT CAN BE COMPETITIVE, 
ONE IN WHICH DALLAS SHOULD HAVE 
AN ADVANTAGE, BUT YOU NEVER 
KNOW. 
>> WE HEARD FROM AVERY JOHNSON. 
HE WAS HAPPY TO GET BACK IN 
TEXAS AIRSPACE. 
DOING HIS AVERY JOHNSON 
IMPERSONATION.
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT 
DOES HOME COOKING DO FOR THE 
MAVS? 
>> IT MEANS A LOT.
THEY WON TWO GAMES IN THIS 
SERIES WIN. 
AND THEY WON THE LAST 10 GAMES 
AGAINST THE HEAT. 
SO HOMECOOK SOMETHING IMPORTANT 
FOR THIS MAVS -- HOMECOOKING IS 
IMPORTANT FOR THIS MAVS' TEAM.
THEY HAVE TO PLAY AGGRESSIVE 
BASKETBALL. 
THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN 
AT GAME THREE AND GAME FIVE.
THEY WERE BLOWN OUT IN GAME 
FOUR. 
BEING AT HOME, THEY HAVE THE 
HOME CROWD, MARK CUBAN WILL BE 
AS CRAZY AS EVER. 
$250,000 FINE, HE IS STILL NOT 
GOING TO BE QUIET.
THEY MIGHT FEEL THAT SOME OF 
THE CALLS WILL COME CAN THEIR 
WAY BECAUSE THEY PLAYED AT 
HOME. 
THIS IS WHY THEY WON 82 GAMES 
SO THEY COULD PLAY AT HOME FOR 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> OH, TO SCREAM FOR 45 
MINUTES.
WISH I COULD AFFORD THAT. 
HOW DOES IT AFFECT IN THE 
PLAYERS' MINDSET COMING INTO 
TONIGHT?
>> THERE IS NO CHOICE IN THIS 
MATTER. 
YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET 
IT DONE.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MIAMI HEAT 
AS COMPARED TO THE DALLAS 
MAVRICKS, WHAT YOU OBSERVE WHEN 
YOU WATCH THESE TWO TEAMS PLAY 
IS THAT MIAMI IS DOING A 
TERRIFIC JOB OF GETTING TO THE 
BASKET, WHICH DRAWS CONTACT.
IN THE HINDS OF THE REFEREE, 
THEY'RE -- IN THE MINDS OF THE 
REFEREE, THEY'RE THE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE TEAM.
IF YOU SET UP FOR JUMP SHOTS, 
IT WILL BE A DISCREPANCY IN THE 
FREE THROWS.
THE TEAM MORE AGGRESSIVE 
GETTING TO THE BASKET WILL GET 
MORE FOULS. 
THEY'RE DRAWING MORE CONTACT. 
THERE ARE MORE PLAYS. 
MORE GUYS BUMPING INTO BODIES.
YOU LOOK FOR DALLAS TO COUNTER 
THAT BY GETTING THEMSELVES TO 
THE BASKET AND WHEN THEY DO 
THAT, THEN THE SCORE IS EVEN. 
SO RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO 
EXCUSES, THAT'S THE WAY THAT 
THE GAME HAS BEEN PLAYED. 
DALLAS HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
CORRECT THAT BUT IT MUST BE 
DONE ON THE FLOOR AND NOT JUST 
HERE TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE 
STUDIO. 
>> WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT IN THE 
STUDIO A LITTLE BIT.
YOU TALK ABOUT THE PHYSICAL 
PLAY HERE, DEE, JERRY 
STACKHOUSE VERY PHYSICAL IN 
GAME FOUR, IT COST HIM GAME 
FIVE. 
>> HE IS THE BEST SCORER OFF 
THE BENCH, HE IS AVERAGING 13.5 
POINTS OFF THE BENCH. 
THAT MIGHT CLOSE THE 
DISCREPANCY IN THE FREE THROWS. 
YOU TAKE AWAY THE FREE THROWS, 
IT WAS CLOSE. 
STACKHOUSE BEING THERE WILL ADD 
TO THAT.
THE MOIMENT HEAT, GARY PAY -- 
THE MIAMI HEAT, GARY PAYTON, HE 
HAS STEPPED UP. 
HE ONLY HAS FOUR TURNOVERS IN 
THIS SERIES, JAMES POSEY HAS A 
12.5 POINTS AND EIGHT REBOUNDS 
AND NOW A GUY COMING OFF THE 
MIAMI BENCH THAT CAN MAYBE 
HANDLE A LITTLE BIT WHICH 
STACKHOUSE DOES AS FAR AS 
SCORING.
HE WILL GET TO THE LINE AND 
MAKE THE REF THE MAKE A CALL. 
HE WON'T TAKE A LOT OF JUMP 
SHOTS.
STACKHOUSE WILL GET THE BALL 
AND GO TO THE BASKET EVERY TIME 
THAT HE TOUCHES IT. 
>> AVERY JOHNSON, THEY'VE BEEN 
SINGING HIS PRAISES, MAYBE HIM 
MOVING THE TEAM TO A HOTEL, IT 
SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THE PRESSURE 
IS STARTING TO GET TO HIM.
AS A PLAYER HOW DO YOU RESPOND 
WHEN YOU SEE THE COACH ACTING 
THAT WAY? 
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS 
ANY WAY TO ACT OTHER THAN TO DO 
THE BEST JOB THAT YOU CAN DO. 
AVERY JOHNSON IS DOING THE BEST 
JOB HE CAN UNDER THE 
CONDITIONS. 
AVERY JOHNSON RIGHT NOW, HOW 
CAN YOU SIT HERE AND TELL ME 
THAT HE WAS EXPECTING THIS. 
THERE IS A -- THAT THERE IS A 
CORRECT WAY OR UNCORRECT WAY TO 
DO THINGS.
AVERY JOHNSON IS THRUST INTO A 
SITUATION WHERE HE HAS TO REACT 
ON HIS FEET AND I THINK THAT HE 
HAS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB.
HIS MAIN FOCUS HAS BEEN ABOUT 
WINNING, HE'S DOING THE RIGHT 
THING TO GET HIS GUYS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO WIN AND THAT'S 
ALL YOU CAN DO FROM THE LEADER 
OF A BALL CLUB. 
>> THE ONLY THING THAT PRESSURE 
BREAKS IS PIPES.
THEY HAVE TO STEP UP AND PLAY.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE REFS. 
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
REFS. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE 
TO MAKE PLAYS.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT, LIKE YOU 
SAID, BUT THE PRESSURE TO PLAY 
-- 
>> WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT IF I 
HAD ANY MORE TIME, I WOULD TALK 
ABOUT HOW TWO-THREE-TWO IS NOT 
FAIR AT ALL.
BUT I'M OUT OF TIME, GUYS.
I HAVE OTHER GUESTS TO GET TO.
DEE BROWN, B.J. ARMSTRONG, 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
WE WELCOME NOW TOM DEANGELOU. 
THE "MIAMI HERALD" COLUMNIST 
QUOTES MARK CUBAN AS SAYING, 
DAVID STERN, YOUR LEAGUE IS 
FIXED AND NOW MARK CUBAN IS 
FINED $250,000. 
WHAT IS THE REACTION IN MIAMI?
>> THAT MARK CUBAN IS DESERVING 
OF WHAT HE GETS.
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE SPOKE TO 
NICKY SINCE THE VEERS BEGAN.
HE'S SITTING AT THE TAIL. 
THEY'RE TWO DIVERSE 
PERSONALITIES AS FAR AS OWNERS 
ARE CONCERNED.
I DON'T THINK THAT THE HEAT 
THEMSELVES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 
MARK CUBAN AND WHAT HE SAYS.
I KNOW THAT MARK CUBAN IS NOT 
VERY POPULAR WITH THE PEOPLE IN 
MIAMI AND I'M SURE THAT ADDS TO 
HIS GROWING LEGACY AND 
UNPOPULARITY DOWN THERE.
>> REFEREING HAS DOMINATED THE 
HEADLINES IN THE SERIES.
A TALE, AGAIN, OF TWO CITIES. 
SEEMS TO GO FOR THE HOME TEAM 
WHEN THEY'VE BEEN AT HOME.
WHAT DOES MIAMI EXPECT AS THE 
SERIES HEADS BACK TO DALLAS?
>> THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO 
EXPECT THAT ANY PERCEIVED 
FAVORITISM WILL GO AWAY.
ANYBODY KNOWS THAT IN THE NBA 
THERE'S A LOT OF CALLS THAT GO 
ONE WAY FOR YOU AT HOME DO NOT 
GO THAT WAY ON THE ROAD.
WOULD THESE CALLS HAVE BEEN 
DIFFERENT HERE IN DALLAS? 
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. 
BUT I THINK THAT THEY'RE 
EXPECTING IT WILL BE A LITTLE 
BIT DIFFERENT.
THEY'RE -- THE BIG THING THAT 
THEY'RE EXPECTING IS, YOU KNOW, 
THE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE AS FAR 
AS THE FANS IS NOT WITH THEM. 
THAT COULD INFLUENCE SOME 
CALLS, AND THEY'RE ON A COURT 
IN WHICH THEY LOST THREE GAMES 
THIS YEAR BY A TOTAL OF 60 
POINTS. 
SO THERE IS A LOT PROBABLY 
GOING AGAINST THEM EVEN THOUGH 
THE TEAM -- YOU'RE A TEAM THAT 
LEADS 3-2, THERE IS A LOT GOING 
AGAINST THEM AND HAVING TO COME 
IN HERE AND WIN ONE GAME IS 
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND, YOU 
KNOW, I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT 
THE FORMAT AND SOME MIGHT SAY 
RIGHT NOW THAT DALLAS STILL HAS 
THE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE 
FLAG THIS BUILDING THAT MIAMI 
HASN'T WON IN FOUR YEARS. 
>> BUT IT SHOULD BE 3-2-1-1-1.
THE HEAT HAS TAKEN THEIR GAME 
TO ANOTHER LEVEL. 
DALLAS DOING EVERYTHING THAT 
THEY CAN TO STOP HIM. 
I WONDER, HOW IS HE GETTING IT 
DONE? 
>> DWAYNE WADE, SINCE THE 
CHICAGO SERIES, THE FIFTH GAME 
OF THE CHICAGO SERIES HAS 
TURNED HIMSELF INTO THE BEST 
PLAYER IN THE NBA.
HE IS UNSTOPPABLE.
DWAYNE WADE ON THE PERIMETER 
AND HE'S GETTING IT DONE 
BECAUSE HE HAS A JUMP SHOT THAT 
WAS NOT THIS GOOD THROUGHOUT 
THE REGULAR SEASON AND IN HIS 
FIRST TWO PLAYOFF APPEARANCES.
ONCE TEAMS START TO BACK OFF OF 
HIM, HE STARTS TO HIT THE 
JUMPER AND NOW YOU HAVE TO GO 
OUT TO HIM. 
HE HAS MADE MORE THREE POINTERS 
THAN IN THE ENTIRE REGULAR 
SEASON. 
IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE JUMP SHOT 
AND MORE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO 
THE BASKET, NOUR PLAYING INTO 
HIS HANDS, JOSH HOWARD SAID IT 
BEFORE THE SERIES, IT IS PICK 
YOUR POISON.
THEY STARTED KILLING HIM WITH 
THE JUMP SHOT.
AS WE SAW IN THE LAST PLAY THAT 
LED TO THE TWO FREE THROWS THAT 
WON GIVEMENT THEY THREW FOUR 
PLAYERS AT HIM. 
HE WENT AROUND OR THROUGH FOUR 
DIFFERENT PLAYERS.
I THINK THAT IT COMES DOWN TO 
NOW JUST TRYING TO -- I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT MORE AVERY JOHNSON 
CAN DO DIVIDING A DEFENSE.
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO GO 
OUT THERE AND STOP HIM. 
>> OR GO BACK TO TIME AND MAKE 
IT 2-2-1-1-1. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MY PLEASURE. 
>> YOU THINK THAT THAT IS ALL 
OF THE BASKETBALL THAT WE HAVE 
FOR YOU?
YOU'RE WRONG. 
RICK BUCHER IS HERE -- RIC 
BUICK ARE IS HERE TO

>> WELCOME BACK TO THE 
"HOTLIST."
IF YOU'RE JUST WAKING UP TODAY, 
HERE'S WHAT YOU MISSED, MARK 
CUBAN -- 
DAVID STERN EARLIER DURING A 
TAPING OF "P.T.I." HAD THIS TO 
SAY.
>> IF FANS AND THE OWNERS ARE 
NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON THE COURT 
VERBALLY ABUSING REFEREES, THEN 
YOU HAVE TO FINE THEM FOR THAT. 
THIS IS A GAME OF RULES AND 
CONVENTIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY 
THOSE RULES AND CONVENTIONS 
COME TO ME TO ENFORCE AND WE 
WILL ENFORCE THEM.
AND I ON OCCASION WHEN I HAVE 
BEEN ASKED, I OFTEN SAY THAT 
MARK HAS BEEN TERRIFIC FOR OUR 
LEAGUE IN TERMS OF THIS CITY OF 
DALLAS. 
HE CARES ABOUT THE GAME.
HE IS ENGAGED IN MAKING THE 
ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE HERE 
TERRIFIC. 
BUT, TO ME THERE IS A FINE 
LINE, BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU 
RUN THE RISK OF TAKING 
ATTENTION OFF THE PLAYERS AND 
EVEN CAUSING THE PLAYERS AND 
THE COACHING STAFF TO BECOME 
DISTRACTED. 
AND I'M TRYING -- I'M TRYING 
VERY HARD TO GET US TO HOWEVER 
MANY GAMES THIS IS GOING TO BE 
WITHOUT THOSE SETS OF 
DISTRACTIONS. 
>> AGAIN, NBA COMMISSIONER 
DAVID STERN DISCUSSING THE FINE 
LEVIED AGAINST DALLAS OWNER 
MARK CUBAN, $250,000 FOR 
REPEATED ACTS OF MISCONDUCT.
SO ALL OF THIS FOR OUR FIRST 
ELIMINATION GAME OF THE NBA 
SEASON. 
THE MAVS LOOKING TO PUT A 
DISASTEROUS WEEK BEHIND THEM IN 
MIAMI.
AND NOW WE WELCOME IN RIC.
$250,000 FINE FOR MARK CUBAN. 
YOUR REACTION?
>> IT IS IN LINE WITH SOME OF 
THE OTHER FINE THAT'S THEY'VE 
HAD.
AS DAVID STERN SAID, YOU DON'T 
WANT THE FOCUS TO BE ON THE 
OWNER.
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE ON 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE GAME 
ITSELF AND THE PLAYERS THAT ARE 
PLAYING IT AND THE COACHES THAT 
ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS. 
SO MARK HAS BEEN RIGHT ON THE 
FRINGES THIS ENTIRE FINALS 
SERIES. 
THERE HAVE BEEN CONTROVERSIAL 
CALLS THAT FITS IN WITH SOME OF 
MARK'S THEORY ABOUT HOW THE 
LEAGUE OPERATES.
ALL OF THAT SAID, I DON'T -- I 
DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH -- 
WITH THE FINE OR THE PUNISHMENT 
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING THAT'S 
HAPPENED, IT IS PROBABLY 
JUSTIFIED.
>> EARL EARLIER ON THE 
"HOTLIST" -- EARLIER ON THE 
"HOTLIST" WE WERE ASK YOUING 
THIS. 
IT TAKES SOME OF THE PRESSURE 
AND SPOTLIGHT OFF THE TEAM 
ITSELF. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> NOT AT ALL.
THE PLAYERS HAVE LEARNED TO 
TUNE MARK OUT AND LET HIM HAVE 
HIS BATTLES.
YOU HEAR DISPARAGING THINGS 
THAT WE LET HIM GO ON AND WE 
TRY TO MAINTAIN OUR FOCUS.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS BY 
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE REFEREES, 
BY SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS 
UNFAIR TREATMENT. 
BY SUGGESTING THAT THE LEAGUE 
HAS ULTERIOR MOTIVES, THAT 
CREATES AN EXCUSE FOR YOUR 
TEAM. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
YOU WANT YOUR TEAM TO BELIEVE 
WHO IS OFFICIATING THE GAME, NO 
MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION IS, 
WE ARE THE BETTER TEAM, AND WE 
ARE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT 
AND WE WILL DO WHATEVER IS 
NECESSARY TO DEMON STHRATE. 
THE REALITY IS WHILE THERE HAVE 
BEEN CONTROVERSIAL CALLS, THERE 
HAVE BEEN DISPUTED CALLS IN 
THIS LAST GAME THE DALLAS 
MAVERICKS WENT 21-25 AT THE 
FREE-THROW LINE.
THE FOUR THAT THEY MISSED WAS 
ONE AT THE END OF REGULATION 
AND THREE IN OVERTIME.
THEY'VE MADE A NUMBER OF MENTAL 
ERRORS. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'VE 
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTROL 
THEIR DESTINY AND CLOSE OUT 
THIS SERIES AT THIS POINT.
SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DOWN 
3-2, HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
WHAT THE OFFICIATING HAS DONE 
AND CUBAN POINTING THAT OUT 
DOES THEM NO FAVORS.
>> CERTAINLY SUGGESTS THOSE 
LATE MISSED FREE THROWS THAT 
PERHAPS THEY'RE FEELING THE 
PRESSURE. 
AS DIRK NOWITZKI GOES, SO GOES 
THE MAVRICKS. 
>> YOU BETTER HOPE NOT. 
>> HE WAS FINED $5,000 FOR 
KICKING A BALL INTO THE STANDS 
FOLLOWING THAT GAME FIVE LOSS.
I WONDER RIGHT NOW WHERE IS 
DIRK'S HEAD?
>> WELL, I'M WONDERING WHERE 
THE STATIONARY ABIKE'S HEAD IS. 
HE KICKED A BASKETBALL AND A 
STATIONARY BIKE AND A TREE OF 
LIGHTS AND HE GETS $5,000 FOR 
THE BASKETBALL. 
THAT SHOULD BE $15,000 BY MY 
COUNT.
I'M JOKING. 
I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE MONEY 
OUT OF DIRK'S POCKET. 
I'M -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A 
GUY WHO GOES BALLISTIC AFTER A 
GAME. 
IF YOU'RE FRUSTRATED AT THE END 
AND LET GO, I WILL GIVE 
THAUFMENT I WANT TO SEE THE 
DIRK NOWITZKI THAT WE SAW AT 
VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE SERIES 
AT SAN ANTONIO WHERE IT DIDN'T 
MATTER HOW THEY DEFENDED HIM. 
IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW THEY WENT 
AT HIM, HE WAS GOING TO BE 
AGGRESSIVE AND GET SOMETHING 
DONE. 
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ON A 
CONSISTENT BASE IN HIS THIS 
SERIES. 
>> UNFORTUNATELY, RIC, WE'RE 
OUT OF TIME.
RIC, WE APPRECIATE YOU STOPPING 
BY. 
>> YOU'VE GOT IT. 
>> A LOT TO GET TO ON THE 
"HOTLIST".

ON ESPNEWS. 
[CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY 
ESPN, INC.]
>> HI, THERE, I'M JUROR 
ELLIOTT.
WELCOME IN TO THE "HOTLIST."
WE'VE GOT A LOST STUFF FOR YOU 
TODAY.
WE'VE GOT WORLD CUP, BASEBALL 
FOR YOU, AND, OF COURSE, GAME 
SIX, NBA FINALS TONIGHT.
A TITLE HANG NOT GUILTY THE 
BALANCE BETWEEN THE DALLAS 
MAVERICKS AND THE MIAMI HEAT. 
AND THAT'S JUST A LITTLE 
SMIDGEN OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO 
BRING TO YOU THE NEXT THREE 
HOURS.
ALSO UP FOR DISCUSSION, BEN 
ROETHLISBERGER MAKING HIS FIRST 
VISIT TO THE STEELERS FOR SOME 
ATHLETIC GEAR, I BELIEVE, SOME 
OTHER THINGS. 
WE'LL FIND OUT EXACTLY WHY. 
AND JERRY STACKHOUSE TONIGHT 
RETURNING.
WILL THAT TIP THE SCALES IN 
FAVOR OF THE MAVS AS THEY TRY 
TO COME BACK FROM THAT 3-2 
DEFICIT?
>> GETS IT OFF THE MIDDLE.
THE CANES HAVE WON THE STANLEY 
CUP.
>> WHAT A GAME SEVEN LAST 
NIGHT.
THE STANLEY CUP HAS A NEW HOME. 
IT IS IN CAROLINA.
THE HURRICANES FINISHING 
BUSINESS, AND FINISHING REALLY 
FANTASTICALLY ENTERTAINING 
GAME. 
JOINSING US NOW TO DISCUSSING 
IT -- TO DISCUSS IT, E.J. 
HRADEK. 
IT'S NICE TO HAVE A GREAT HAT 
MOST FEAR.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE? 
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
THE FANS IN THE BUILDING WERE 
NERVOUS, THEY WERE EXCITED. 
THEY WERE LOUD. 
I THINK THE HOME FANS THERE IN 
CAROLINA GOT REALLY WHAT THEY 
NEEDED EARLY IN THAT GAME WHEN 
CAM WARD SCORED EARLY IN THE 
GAME. 
IT REALLY GOT THEM INTO THINGS 
EARLY.
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
GAME SEVEN, LIKE YOU SAY, IT'S 
HARD TO FIND A BAD ENVIRONMENT 
FOR A GAME SEVEN OF A PRO SPORT 
SERIES. 
BUT IT WAS A LOT OF FUN LAST 
NIGHT.
HATS OFF TO CAROLINA, AND 
REALLY, CONGRATULATIONS TO 
EDMONTON, TOO.
THEY HAD A GREAT SERIES.
>> THE HOME TEAM IN GAME SEVEN, 
11-2 HEADING INTO GAME SEVEN. 
SO I WONDER, HOW SURPRISED 
SHOULD WE BE? 
IT MONTON OILERS, THE EIGHTH 
SEED IN THE WEST. 
THEY MADE A SPIRITED RUN HERE.
BUT IN THE END -- 
>> THEY HAD A 3-1 LEAD, SO IT 
WAS THEIR CUP TO LOSE.
BUT THEY ALMOST LOST IT.
THEY LOST GAME FIVE IN OVERTIME 
GIVING UP A SHORT-HANDED GOAL 
IN OVERTIME.
UNHEARD OF TO THINK OF THAT.
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE PENALTIES IN 
OVERTIME IN THE PATH. 
THAT'S PART OF THE NEW NHL. 
THEY WERE DOMINANT IN GAME SIX 
IN EDMONTON.
SO I THINK THEY WERE A NERVOUS 
BUNCH.
I TALKED TO RAY WHITNEY AFTER 
THE GAME LAST NIGHT.
HE GREW UP IN EDMONTON. 
HE WAS A STICK BOY FOR THE 
EDMONTON OILERS AS A KID AND 
NOW HE'S PLAYING FOR THE CANES. 
SO HE WAS A NERVOUS WRECK ALL 
DAY.
EDMONTON, BOY, THEY FOUGHT 
THROUGHOUT THE PLAYOFFS.
THEY WERE A RESILIENT BUNCH AND 
THEY GOT A LOT OF TIMELY GOALS 
ALONG THE WAY.
REALLY, LAST NIGHT, I THINK IT 
WAS UP FOR GRABS AND I GIVE 
CAROLINA FULL MARKS FOR 
REGROUPING AND PAYING THE HECK 
OF A GAME.
>> YOU USED THE WORD KID. 
NO BETTER DESCRIPTION FOR CAM 
WARD, THE FIRST ROOKIE 
GOALTENDER TO WIN THE CUP.
HEADY COMPANY FOR HIM.
WHAT DID HE MEAN TO THIS 
HURRICANES TEAM?
>> WELL, HE REALLY DID 
EVERYTHING. 
GERBER COULDN'T GET IT DONE 
EARLY IN THE PLAYOFFS.
HE WAS THEIR STARTER DURING THE 
SEASON. 
PLAYED POORLY IN THE FIRST TWO 
GAMES.
CAM WARD CAME TO THE RESCUE.
I WANT TO CHECK THIS KID'S 
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE HE'S 22. 
HE WAS JUST SO COOL AND SO CALM 
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PLAYOFFS.
EVERY TIME I DEALT WITH HIM 
THROUGH THE LAST THREE ROUNDS, 
JUST A VERY COOL DEMEANOR, NO 
MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION WAS.
AND IT RUBBED OFF ON HIS 
TEAMMATES.
HE'S GOT TOGETHER TO GET 
RATTLED, AND HE PLAYED GREAT 
THROUGHOUT THE PLAYOFFS.
HE WAS A WORTHY WINNER OF THE 
CONN SMYTH TROPHY.
>> YOU KNOW, AND I WONDER, FROM 
THE KID TO THE OLD BEARD, THE 
LAST HARTFORD WHALER REMAINING 
ON THE ROSTER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS LIKE 
FOR HIM?
>> IT HAD TO BE A DREAM COME 
DROW FOR WESLEY.
HE CAME INTO THE PLAYOFFS MUCH 
LIKE AN DRI CHUCK DID, AS A GUY 
WHO PLAYED THE MOST GAMES 
WITHOUT WINNING A STANLEY CUP.
WESLEY WAS BRUISED AND BATTERED 
DURING THE STANLEY CUP RUN. 
HE'S BEEN ENJOYING THIS TIME 
OFF TO REST UP. 
WHO KNOWS?
HE MAY WALK AWAY RIGHT NOW. 
THINKS THE TIME, REALLY, IF YOU 
WANT TO GO OUT ON TOP, THERE'S 
NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT. 
WESLEY WAS AN INSPIRATION TO 
HIS TEAMMATES.
IT'S GREAT TO SEE A GUY WHO'S 
PLAYED SO LONG IN THE LEAGUE TO 
GET REWARDED, TO GET A STANLEY 
CUP.
BOTH HIM, ROB BRIND'AMOUR, 
HEDICAN, GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN 
AROUND THE LEAGUE A LONG TIME.
THEY HAD CHANCES BEFORE.
THEY DIDN'T GET IT DONE.
THIS TIME THEY WEREN'T 
DISAPPOINTED AND THEY GOT TO 
RAISE THE STANLEY CUP.
>> THE STANLEY CUP FINALS 
SERIES, AGAIN, A PHENOMENAL 
SERIES IT'S GOOD TO HAVE HOCKEY 
BACK. 
E.J. HRADEK, "ESPN THE 
MAGAZINE," SENIOR WRITER, WE 
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ON THE 
PHONE TODAY.
>> THANKS, JOSH.
>> SO AGAIN, I'M SORT OF 
STEALING SOME OF YOUR THUNDER 
THERE, DANYELLE SARGENT.
THE HURRICANES GET IT DONE IN 
GAME SEVEN. 
IF YOU SAW ANY OF THE SERIES, 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT.
IT'S FANTASTIC TO HAVE PLAYOFF 
HOCKEY TODAY. 
>> YOU'RE NOT STEALING MY 
THUNDER.
I'M GOING TO START WITH THE NBA 
TODAY.
>> VERY WISE. 
>> DO WHAT I CAN DO.
IF YOU SAW GAME FIVE BETWEEN 
THE DALLAS MAVERICKS AND THE 
MIAMI HEAT, THEN YOU SAW MARK 
CUBAN.
THE MAVS' OWNER HAS BEEN FINED 
$250,000 FOR WHAT THE LEAGUE IS 
CALLING SEVERAL ACTS OF 
MISCONDUCT FOLLOWING THAT GAME. 
THE FINE IS THE THIRD LARGEST 
EVER LEVIED BY THE NBA AND 
BRINGS CUBAN'S TOTAL TO MORE 
THAN $1.5 MILLION.
EARLIER TODAY DADE STERN 
COMMENTED ON THE FINE DURING A 
TAPED SEGMENT FOR "P.T.I."
>> IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO BE 
ON THE COURT VERBALLY AUSING 
REFEREES, AS WE DID EARLIER IN 
THE SEASON, YOU HAVE TO FINE 
THEM FOR THAT.
THIS IS A GAME OF RULES AND 
CONVENTIONS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE RULES AND 
CONVENTIONS COME TO ME TO 
ENFORCE, AND WE WILL ENFORCE 
THEM. 
AND ON OCCASION WHEN I HAVE 
BEEN ASKED I OFTEN SAY THAT 
MARK HAS BEEN TERRIFIC FOR OUR 
LEAGUE IN TERMS OF THIS CITY OF 
DALLAS. 
HE CARES ABOUT THE GAME.
HE IS ENGAGED IN MAKING THE 
ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE HERE 
TERRIFIC. 
BUT TO ME THERE'S A FINE LINE, 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU RUN 
THE RISK OF TAKING ATTENTION 
OFF THE PLAYERS AND EVEN 
CAUSING THE PLAYERS AND THE 
COACHING STAFF TO BECOME 
DISTRACTED. 
AND I'M TRYING VERY HARD TO GET 
US TO HOWEVER MANY GAMES THIS 
IS GOING TO BE WITHOUT THOSE 
SETS OF DISTRACTIONS. 
>> FOR THE REST OF THAT 
INTERVIEW CHECK OUT "P.T.I." 
5:00 EASTERN ON ESPN. 
MEANWHILE, HEAT AND MAVS BIG 
GAME TONIGHT. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE WILL RETURN 
FOR THE MAVS AFTER SERVING A 
ONE-GAME SUSPENSION FOR A 
FLAGRANT FOUL ON SHAQ.
HOME TEAM HAS WON THE FIRST 
FIVE GAMES OF THE SERIES. 
THROUGH THE FIRST TWO GAMES OF 
THE NBA FINALS, THE HEAT HAD 
ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED FEWER 
FREE-THROWS THAN THE MAVERICKS. 
BUT WHEN THE SERIES SHIFTED TO 
MIAMI, THE CALLS SHIFTED THE 
HEAT'S WAY, CULMINATING IN A 
GAME FIVE THAT SAW THE HEAT GO 
TO THE LINE ALMOST TWICE AS 
OFTEN AS THE MAVS.
AND, OF COURSE, GAME SIX 
TONIGHT ON ABC. 
COVERAGE STARTING AT 8:30 
EASTERN WITH THE CHEVROLET NBA 
NATION PREGAME SHOW.
TIP-OFF IS AT 9:00 EASTERN. 
AMARE STOUDEMIRE'S COMEBACK MAY 
LAND HIM IN SIN CITY. 
HE'S WRAPPING UP HIS FINAL WEEK 
OF REHAB AND PLANS TO START 
ONE-ON-ONE PLAY SO HE CAN HEAD 
TO LAS VEGAS FOR THE SUNS' 
SUMMER WEEK IN JULY.
IN NFL NEWS, BEN ROETHLISBERGER 
WAS AT THE STEELERS' TEAM 
COMPLEX FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE THAT JUNE 12 MOTORCYCLE 
ACCIDENT THAT LANDED HIM IN THE 
HOSPITAL. 
HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY PART IN 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, BUT DID 
PICK UP HIS MAIL AND SOME 
ATHLETIC GEAR.
THE TEAM REMAINS OPTIMISTIC 
THAT HE'LL BE READY TO GO FOR 
THE STEELERS OPEN ON SEPTEMBER 
7.
GERMANY HAS ALREADY PUNCHED ITS 
TICKET TO THE SECOND ROUND IN 
WORLD CUP.
HASN'T LOST A MATCH SINCE 1986. 
THEY NEED A WIN TO FINISH FIRST 
IN GROUP A. 
TODAY TAKING ON ECUADOR WHO 
NEED JUST A TIE.
HAVEN'T CONCEDED A WIN IN THEIR 
LAST THREE WORLD CUP MATCHES. 
FOURTH MINUTE, BALL PASSED INTO 
THE BOX.
COL SAY WITH THE GOAL.
NERM KNEE UP 1-0. 
BALANCIC INTO THE BOX FOR KLOSE 
WHO BEAT THE DEFENDER.
SECOND GOAL OF THE MATCH. 
GERMANY LEADING 2-0 AT THE 
HALF. 
SECOND HALF, THINKS THE SEVENTH 
MINUTE. 
LUCAS PODOLSKY WITH THE LEFT 
FOOD. 
GERMANY TAKING THE GAME.
THEY HAVE THE MAXIMUM NINE 
POINTS. 
GERMANY OFF TO ITS BEST WORLD 
CUP START IN 36 YEARS.
>> 33RD MINUTE, POLAND IN 
WHITE, DOWN 1-0.
KICK, BOSACKI.
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS.
THE COSTA RICAN GOALIE TRIPPED 
UP. 
66TH MINUTE, STILL TIED.
BOSACKI KNOCKING THE HEADER IN 
AT THE FAR POST, HIS SECOND OF 
THE GAME. 
POLAND WINS 2-1, ITS FIRST 
VICTORY OF 2006.
THIS IS COSTA RICA'S FOURTH 
STRAIGHT LOSS.
BOTH POLAND AND COSTA RICA HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN ELIMINATED FROM 
THE WORLD CUP.
JOSH, DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW 
THIS, BUT THE HURRICANES ARE 
GOING TO HAVE A CELEBRATORY 
PARADE A LITTLE BIT LATER AND 
DRAG THE STANLEY CUP AROUND ALL 
OVER THE CITY OF RALEIGH. 
IT SHOULD BE FUN. 
>> VERY DESERVING, BY THE WAY.
LOTS MORE COMING UP.
LOTS OF BREAKING WORLD CUP NEWS 
AND ALAN HOPKINS JOINING US 
NEXT. 
HE'S GOING TO BREAK DOWN A LOT 
OF WORLD CUP FOR US, INCLUDING 
ENGLAND'S LOSS OF MICHAEL OWEN 
ONE MINUTE INTO THEIR GAME 
AGAINST SWEDEN TODAY. 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT.
ALSO COMING UP IN OUR LEAGUE, 
PLAY CONTINUES IN BASEBALL. 
ROB NEYER WILL DISCUSS A-ROD'S 
RELATIVE CLUTCHNESS AND HOOKING 
UP WITH THE FISH. 
MARLINS ROOKIE WILL JOIN US AT 
3:40 EASTERN.
>> WELCOME BACK TO THE ESPN 
NEWSROOM JUST ADJACENT TO THE 
ESPN NEWSROOM, YES, INDEAD. 
ALAN HOPKINS HERE TO TALK ABOUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THE POND.
LOTS TO GET TO. 
LET'S START WITH A GAME THAT 
ALREADY PLAYED TODAY, 
GERMANY-ECUADOR, THE HOST 
LOOKING -- CONTINUING, REALLY, 
TO LOOK VERY ELM PRESSIVE 
AGAINST AN ECUADOR TEAM THAT 
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A DARK HORSE 
FAVORITE AFTER THE FIRST TWO 
GAMES.
YOUR IMPRESSIONS, FIRST OF ALL, 
OF THE HOSTS. 
>> THIS MATCH MEANT SOMETHING.
BECAUSE THE WINNER WANTED TO 
CONTROL THEIR OWN DESTINY, IF 
YOU WILL, AND TAKE ON THE 
SECOND PLACE TEAM FROM GROUP B, 
MORE THAN LIKELY AVOIDING THE 
ENGLAND TEAM. 
WHAT I SAW IS A GERMANY TEAM 
THAT IS MOTIVATED.
THEIR DEFENSE IN THAT FIRST 
MATCH ARE LONG BEHIND THEM AND 
THEY SCORED THREE GREAT GOALS 
AGAINST A GOOD ECUADOR TEAM.
ECUADOR HAS A GOOD CHANCE OF 
GETTING INTO THE LAST EIGHT.
KLINSMANN GETS A LOT OF CREDIT. 
HE CHANGED THE MENTALITY OF 
THIS TEAM.
THEY GO FORWARD, THEY DON'T 
PLAY NEGATIVE.
THEY'RE NOT SCARED TO DO GO 
FORWARD.
THEY SCORED THREE GOALS.
AND IF THEY CAN SCORE AND 
CONTINUE TO GET SHUTOUTS IN 
BACK-TO-BACK MATCHES, GERMANY 
WILL BE IN THE FINAL. 
IT'S AN ADVANTAGE TO BE A HOST 
NATION AND THEY'RE PLAYING 
WELL. 
>> KLOSE FINDING THE OLD ONION 
BAGS THERE. 
PLAYED THE WHOLE GAME AND 
REALLY LOOKED GOOD. 
MEANWHILE, ECUADOR, THIS IS A 
TEAM THAT HAS BEATEN BRAZIL AND 
ARGENTINA THIS YEAR.
THEY WERE A DYNAMO IN 
QUALIFYING. 
MAYBE A BIT OF A SETBACK HERE, 
BUT DO YOU STILL LIKE THEM? 
>> I DO.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE A TOUGH 
MATCHUP, MAINLY BECAUSE THEY'RE 
NOT SCARED OF ANYONE. 
AS YOU SAID, BEATING BRAZIL AND 
ARGENTINE NARCS THE ONLY TEAM 
IN THE WORLD TO DO THAT.
THEY HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
AND TODAY THEY WERE GOING TO 
THROTTLE DOWN, DOWNSHIFT A BIT. 
THEY KNEW FO GO FAR IN THE 
FOURMENT THEY HAVE TO KEEP 
EVERYONE FRESH. 
ECUADOR FEELS IT'S BEEN A BIG 
SUCCESS, BUT I KNOW THE COACHES 
AND THE PLAYERS FEEL LIKE 
THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE.
>> WE MOVE ON TO ENGLAND AND 
SWEDEN. 
AS WE JUST LEARNED, OF COURSE, 
MICHAEL OWEN, ENGLAND STRIKER, 
GOING DOWN, NOT TOUCHED, NOT 
TACKLED IN THE FIRST MINUTE.
REPLACED BY PETER CROUCH. 
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THIS? 
WE THOUGHT WAYNE ROONEY WAS 
GOING TO BE THE QUESTION. 
>> WELL, EVEN THOUGH MICHAEL 
OWEN HAS NOT PLAYED HIS BEST IN 
THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS FOR 
ENGLAND, YOU SEE THE INJURY 
HERE, HE'S THE GUY THAT THE 
OTHER TEAMS RESPECT.
THEY HAVE THE GAME PLAN FOR.
ONCE YOU TAKE HIM OUT, ALL OF A 
SUDDEN THE OPPOSITION FEELS 
LIKE THAT'S A HUGE ADVANTAGE. 
PETER CROUCH IS NOT SCARING 
ANYONE. 
MICHAEL OWEN, WAYNE ROONEY 
KEEPS DEFENDERS UP AT NIGHT.
WITHOUT MICHAEL OWEN THAT HURTS 
ENGLAND'S CHANCES.
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS COMPLAINING 
ABOUT THE TACTICS, FEELING LIKE 
HE WASN'T GETTING THE BEST 
OPPORTUNITIES.
WITH THAT INJURY -- AND THOSE 
ARE THE WORST INJURIES, WHEN 
YOU GO DOWN, NONCONTACT 
INJURIES, AND YOU ONLY HOPE 
HE'S OK.
HE'S VERY MUCH LIKE KERRI WOOD. 
AS SOON AS YOU START TO SEE THE 
BEST OF HIM HE GETS HURT. 
IT'S A SHAME, A BLOW FOR 
ENGLAND.
>> TWO INJURIES, THE FAKE ONES 
AND THE DEVASTATING ONE.
>> GOOD POINT.
>> ENGLAND-SWEDEN PLAYING RIGHT 
NOW.
LET'S TAKE A LIVE LOOK HERE.
GETS'S GO TO WAYNE ROONEY.
STARTING WAYNE ROONEY, A 
QUESTION MARK FOR SOME. 
HE SEEMS TO BE REALLY USING HIM 
A LOT.
IS THIS A MOVE OF DESPERATION 
OR A MOVE OF WISDOM ON THE PART 
OF THE COACH? 
>> I THINK IT'S WISDOM. 
REMEMBER, HE HAS NOT PLAYED 
THAT MUCH SINCE HURTING HIS 
FOOT ON APRIL 29. 
AGAINST THE MANCHESTER UNITED 
CHELSEA GAME. 
HE NEEDS TO PLAY AS MUCH AS HE 
CAN TO GET HIMSELF FIT. 
AND THAT'S WHY MICHAEL BALANCE 
LACK ALSO PLAYED THE FULL 90. 
SO HE MISSED THE OPENING MATCH. 
THESE COACHES NEED TO HAVE THE 
PLAYERS CLICKING ON ALL 
CYLINDERS TO GET DEEP INTO THE 
TOURNAMENT. 
>> THIS IS ALSO VERY 
INTERESTING.
IT BECOMES LIKE THE NFL WILD 
CARD SCENARIO.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> RIGHT NOW THUS FAR IN THIS 
TOURNAMENT, LITTLE TINY 
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO HOPING THEY 
PLAY FOR A WIN. 
THEY NEED ONE TO WIN. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO TIE. 
AS WE TAKE MORE OF A LOOK HERE. 
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IN THIS 
GAME? 
DO YOU SEE THESE TWO TEAMS SET 
H-SETTLING FOR A TIE 
>> THEY MAY NOT SETTLE FOR A 
TIFMENTE SWEDEN HAS NOT LOST TO 
ENGLAND SINCE 1968. 
SEVEN OF THOSE 11 MATCHES HAVE 
ENDED UP IN DRAWS.
I WAS AT THE 2002 MATCH BETWEEN 
THESE TWO TEAMS IN JAPAN LAST 
WORLD CUP.
1-1 WAS THE SCORE THERE.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TALLY IN 
THOSE 11 MATCHES, LOTS OF 
1-1'S, LOTS OF SCORELESS TIES.
I LOOK FOR THOSE TWO TEAMS TO 
SHARE THE POINTS. 
THEY NEED TO DO WHAT THEY NEED 
TO DO, TAKE CARE OF THEIR 
BUSINESS. 
AND THEN HOPE THINGS GO THEIR 
WAY.
>> ALL RIGHT. 
YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE U.S. AND 
GHANA.
THIS IS A VERY SHAKY, NERVOUS, 
NERVOUS NELLY TIME. 
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR THE U.S. 
TO BEAT GHANA, WHICH IS THEIR 
ONLY HOPE OF MOVING THROUGH, OF 
COURSE, WITH SOME OTHER HELP. 
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IF THE U.S. 
ADVANCES? 
>> ITALY GOT THEM THAT GOAL, 
AND YOU NEED A BREAK, YOU NEED 
A BOUNCE TO GET YOU THROUGH A 
TOURNAMENT. 
BUT THE FACT IS THE U.S. ATTACK 
HAS STRUGGLED.
NO SHOTS ON GOAL AGAINST A VERY 
GOOD ITALIAN DEFENSE. 
AND GHANA IS AS GOOD AS THINK 
TEAM IN THIS WORLD CUP. 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GOING TO BE 
MISSING THEIR TWO GUYS UP 
FRONT, THEY'VE STILL GOT GOOD 
PACE. 
I LOOK FOR EDDY JOHNSON, A 
PLAYER WITH HIS CALIBER, TO 
HAVE AN IMPACT IN THIS MATCH. 
IF THEY DON'T HANDLE GHANA'S 
SPEED IT WILL BE A LONG DAY FOR 
A STRUGGLING U.S. ATTACK. 
>> WE COULD GO INTO ALL THE 
PERMANENT YENTATIONS, BUT LET'S 
NO. 
HOW LIKELY IS IT THEY'LL BEAT 
THE CZECH REPUBLIC? 
>> I I THINK IT'S'S VERY 
LIKELY. 
BRAZIL IS THEIR TRUMP CARD. 
ITALY DOES NOT WANT TO FACE 
BRAZIL ANY EARLIER THAN THEY 
WOULD LIKE TO.
THE U.S. KNOW THEIR ONLY WAY 
THROUGH IS MORE THAN LIKELY TOO 
TAKE ON BRAZIL, MAYBE FEELING 
LIKE THEY CAN RE-CREATE THE 
MAGIC OF 1998 WHEN THEY BEAT 
BRAZIL IN THE OAKLAND COLISEUM 
IN THE GOLD CUP.
ITALY WANTS TO GO FAR IN THE 
TOURNAMENT AND THEY KNOW THEY 
NEED TO AVOID BRAZIL. 
SO THEY HAVE TO PLAY AND GO FOR 
EVERYTHING AGAINST THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC TEAM, THAT IS LICKING 
THEIR WOUNDS. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
AND, AGAIN, WE'RE LOOKING LIVE 
HERE, ENGLAND-SWEDEN FPBLET 
WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO 
TRADITIONAL POWER TEAMS HERE. 
IN RECENT CUPS PAST WE HAVE 
SEEN UNDERDOGS, BUT WE HAVEN'T 
SEEN A WHOLE LOT OF UPSETS THUS 
FAR.
WHERE HAVE ALL OUR UPSETS GONE? 
>> THAT MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST 
UPSET IS THAT THERE ARE NO 
UPSETS. 
AND THIS IS SHAPING UP TO BE A 
WHO'S WHO TOURNAMENT. 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE BIGGEST 
NAMES IN INTERNATIONAL SOCCER, 
THEY ARE SOME OF THE BEST 
TEAMS.
AND IF THE U.S. GETS THERE, IT 
WILL CERTAINLY SPEAK TO HOW FAR 
THEY'VE COME AS A SOCCER 
NATION. 
BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH 
NOW ON A BREAK OR A BOUNCE. 
YOU'RE EARNING YOUR WAY THROUGH 
THIS TOURNAMENT AND THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE.
>> MY KINGDOM FOR TRINIDAD AND 
COULD BAGE GO.
THAT'S ALAN HOPKINS, AND HOW 
GOOD WAS THAT?
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
>> THANKS, JOSH.
>> STILL LOTS TO GET TO HERE ON 
THE "HOTLIST."
INCLUDING JERRY WEAVER, 4-0.
WHAT DOES THAT GET HIM? 
A TICKET BACK TO THE MINORS.
ROB NEYER JINS US NEXT TO TELL 
US WHY I.

OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

JOINING US NOW TO TALK ALL 
THINGS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, 
WE WELCOME IN, FROM ONE OF MY 
FAVORITE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY, 
PORTLAND. 
ROB NEYER OF ESPN.COM.
AND, ROB, LET'S LOOK AT THE 
INNER LEAGUE PLAY.
WE'RE IN IT RIGHT NOW.
IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC.
OBVIOUSLY, PEOPLE CAN FEEL HOW 
THEY WANT TO FEEL BIT.
BUT FROM WHAT IT'S TAUGHT US, 
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO 
LEAGUES?
>> WELL, I THINK WE'VE LEARNED 
AS MUCH AS WE CAN FROM A 
RELATIVELY LIMITED NUMBER OF 
GAMES THAT THE AMERICAN LEAGUE 
IS THE BETTER LEAGUE. 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY. 
THIS YEAR THE A.L. IS 51-39.
NOT A LOT OF GAMES. 
BUT LAST YEAR THEY WERE 
136-116.
AGAIN, NOT A LOT OF GAMES, BUT 
ENOUGH TO TELL US SOMETHING.
LET'S GO BEYOND JUST THE 
INTERLEAGUE GAMES.
LET'S LOOK AT THE WORLD SERIES. 
FROM 1998 THROUGH LAST SEASON, 
THE AMERICAN LEAGUE HAS WON 29 
WORLD SERIES GAMES, THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE 12 GAMES. 
YOU KNOW, HASN'T WON AN 
ALL-STAR GAME SINCE 1996. 
IN THAT SPAN YALE HAS OUTSCORED 
THE N.L. 60-36. 
SO YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THESE AND 
YOU SAY MAYBE IT'S RANDOM, 
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
INTERLEAGUE GAME, THE WORLD 
SERIES, THE ALL-STAR GAME, IT'S 
PRETTY CLEAR, AT LEAST TO ME 
THAT, THE AMERICAN LEAGUE IS 
NOT ONLY THE BETTER LEAGUE, BUT 
THE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER 
LEAGUE. 
>> SO I WONDER WHAT TO 
ATTRIBUTE THIS TO.
OBVIOUSLY, BOTH LEAGUES HAVE 
THINGS -- NATIONALLY TEAMS 
AREN'T NECESSARILY KEEPING GUYS 
ON THE ROSTER THAT THEY CAN USE 
AT D.H.'S IN AMERICAN LEAGUE 
PARKS AND AMERICAN LEAGUE 
PITCHERS ARE NOT USED TO 
HITTING.
WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE IT TO IN 
THE END?
>> WELL, I THINK THE A.L. IS 
FLAT OUT BETTER.
AS FAR AS WHY THAT IS, IT'S 
HAZY. 
THERE'S CERTAINLY LUCK INVOLVED 
THERE.
BUT WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY HAPPENED 
IS THAT YOU HAVE THE TWO 
RICHEST TEAMS IN BASEBALL, IN 
THE AMERICAN LEAGUE, THE 
YANKEES AND THE RED SOX, 
OBVIOUSLY.
AND THEN YOU HAVE TEAMS THAT 
SAY WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH 
THESE GUYS. 
WE HAVE TO BE SMARTER.
AND I'M SHOWING MY BIASES HERE, 
I SUPPOSE, BUT I THINK YOU'VE 
GOT MORE SMART PEOPLE RUNNING 
TEAMS IN THE AMERICAN LEAGUE 
THAN IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE AND 
THAT SHOWS UP ON THE FIELD. 
>> WITH UNBALANCED SCHEDULES 
AND CERTAIN TEAMS, ESPECIALLY 
IN THE INTERLEAGUE PLAY, 
PLAYING OTHER CERTAIN TEAMS, IS 
IT FAIR IN THE END THAT 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY, THE RAW 
NUMBERS, THE RAW GAME TOTALS, 
IS IT FAIR THAT THEY MEAN 
EXACTLY THE SAME? 
>> WELL, THERE'S NO WAY TO GET 
AROUND IT.
YOU CAN'T COUNT THOSE GAMES.
I DO THINK THERE IS AN INEQUITY 
IN THE SCHEDULING, PARTICULARLY 
WHEN IT COMES TO WILD CARDS 
WITHIN THE LEAGUE.
SOME TEAMS SIMPLY HAVE MUCH 
BETTER SCHEDULES, BOTH IN THE 
INTERLEAGUE AND 
INTERDIVISIONAL.
BUT THAT'S THE WAY BASEBALL HAS 
CHOSEN TO DO IT.
FOOTBALL DOPES IT THE SAME WAY, 
THEY -- DOES IT THE SAME WAY, 
THEY DON'T HAVE BALANCED 
SCHEDULE. 
BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT IS 
GOING TO BE THE TEAMS AT THE 
END -- THE TEAMS THAT WIN ARE 
THE TEAMS THAT DID PLAY THE 
BEST. 
>> YOU MENTIONED ALL OF THE 
SMARTY-PANTS OVER IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
MORENO AND IN ANAHEIM OR LOS 
ANGELES, THEY BRING BACK COULD 
LOAN, AND THEN THEY SEND JARED 
WEAVER WHO'S 4-0 BACK TO THE 
MINORS. 
HOW GOOD A DECISION IS THAT?
>> I THINK IT DEPENDS HOW LONG 
THE DECISION LASTS. 
IF THEY'RE SENDING HIM BACK FOR 
A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHILE THEY 
TRAIN ONE OF THEIR VETERAN 
STARTERS, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
BUT IF YOU'RE SENDING HIM DOWN 
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS JUST SO 
YOU CAN CLEAR SPACE FOR COLON 
AND FOR JEFF, ETC., IT'S A BAD 
MOVE. 
IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE TO 
THE PLAYERS.
THEY ALSO HAVE HOWIE KENDRICK 
WHO'S BATTING .396. 
WHAT ELSE DOES A GUY HAVE TO 
DO? 
THE ANGELS HAVE ALWAYS LIKED 
VETERANS. 
THEY'RE GOING TO STICK WITH 
GARRETT AND THE OTHERS. 
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE A 
YEAR OR TWO TO COMMIT TO THE 
YOUNGER PLAYERS, WHICH IS WHAT 
THEY SHOULD DO NOW. 
>> IT LOOKS LIKE THE ANGELS ARE 
IN FACT GOING TO GO DOWN WITH 
ALL THE OLDER PLAYERS.
A-ROD, IF HE DOES WELL IN A 
GAME IT'S ALMOST A CINCH THE 
YANKS ARE GOING TO LOSE IT AND 
HE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE IN 
CLUTCH SITUATIONS.
YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING TAKE ON 
THE CRITICISM HEAPED UPON HIM.
WHY IS HE NOT SO CLUTCH?
>> WELL, I THINK HE'S PERFECTLY 
CLUTCH. 
I THINKS'S JUST FINE. 
I LOOKED AT HIS NUMBERS 
YESTERDAY, AND WHERE HE FALLS 
DOWN THIS SEASON IS IN THE STAT 
CALLED CLOSING. 
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUSLY.
SEVENTH INNING OR LATER, VERY 
CLOSE GAME. 
BUT IT'S LIKE 38 AT-BATS. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAME 
SITUATIONS LAST YEAR. 
HE DID GREAT. 
YEAR BEFORE THAT, HE WAS OK.
IT'S A ONE-SEASON THING, MOST 
LIKELY, OR A HALF A SEASON 
THING.
EVERY PLAYER IS GOING TO GO 
THROUGH THIS. 
EVEN DAVID ORTIZ, WHERE THEY 
DON'T DO WELL AT A LIMITED 
NUMBER OF AT-BATS.
BUT HE DOES IT. 
BECAUSE HE PLAYS FOR THE 
YANKEES, ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE 
SUPPOSEDED TO BE PSYCHOLOGISTS 
AND GET INSIDE HIS HEAD AND 
FIGURE OUT WHY HE'S STRUGGLING. 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS. 
WHETHER IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL OR A 
RANDOM FLUCTUATION, HE'LL COME 
OUT OF IT.
AND HE'LL HAVE SOME BIG HITS 
DOWN THE STRETCH, I GUARANTEE 
YOU.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT HIS NUMBERS, 
HE'S COMING OUT OF IT SOONER, 
THAN LATER. 
ROB NEYER, AS ALWAYS, WE 
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
>> YOU BET. 
TAKE CARE, JOSH.
>> STILL TO GET TO HERE ON "THE 
HOTLIST," THE TWO COACHES.
IT WAS GOING AVERY'S WAY FOR A 
WHILE, BUT NOW IT'S FIRMLY IN 
PAT RILEY'S COURT.{>
>> WELCOME BACK TO THE HOTTEST 
OF "HOTLIST." 
HERE ARE THE STORIES WE'RE 
COVERING. 
A TITLE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. 
GAME SIX TONIGHT, DALLAS-MIAMI. 
COVERAGE BEGINS AT 8:30 EASTERN 
ON ABC. 
AND -- WELL, A BIT OF A SUBPLOT 
FOR THAT. 
MARK CUBAN, MAVS' OWNER FINED 
$250,000 FOR REPEATED ACTS OF 
MISCONDUCT. 
AND TODAY IN WORLD CUP ACTION, 
ALREADY GERMANY ALREADY 
THROUGH, BEATS ECUADOR, ALREADY 
THROUGH.
THEY WIN GROUP A. 
>> FROM THE WORLDWIDE LEADER IN 
SPORTS, THIS IS "THE HOTLIST" 
ON ESPNEWS. 
>> WELCOME BACK TO THE ESPN 
NEWSROOM. 
THINKS "THE HOTLIST." 
I'M LOOKING AT THIS LIST OF 
STUFF WE HAVE FOR YOU.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A COUPLE OF 
VISITS FROM SOME BALLPLAYERS, 
AND PETER GAMMONS WILL DROP BY 
TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT 
THOSE GUYS DON'T. 
AND WE STILL HAVE A BUNCH OF 
BASKETBALL AND WORLD CUP FOR 
YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT 
SOME OF THE HEADLINES THAT WE 
ARE FOLLOWING AS OF NOW.
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S DANYELLE 
SARGENT OVER THERE. 
>> IT'S ME, HI, JOSH. 
>> GIVE US A NEWS UPDATE, 
PLEASE. 
>> I WILL.
WE'LL GET EVERYONE UP TO DATE 
ON BIG BEN IN JUST A MINUTE.
IF YOU SAW GAME FIVE BETWEEN 
DAFFLES AND MIAMI, THEN YOU SAW 
MARK CUBAN. 
THE MAVS' OWNER HAS BEEN FINED 
$250,000, WHAT THE LEAGUE IS 
CALLING SEVERAL ACTS OF 
MISCONDUCT FOLLOWING THAT GAME. 
THE FINE IS THE THIRD LARGEST 
EVER LEVIED BY THE NBA AND 
BRINGS CUBAN'S GRAND TOTAL TO 
MORE THAN $1.5 MILLION. 
EARLIER TODAY COMMISSIONER
DAVID STERN COMMENTED ON THE 
FINE DURING A TAPED SEGMENT FOR 
"P.T.I."
>> IF OWNERS -- IF FANS AND 
OWNERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO BE OUT 
ON THE COURT VERBALLY ABUSING 
REFEREES, THEN, YOU KNOW, AS WE 
DID EARLIER THIS SEASON, YOU 
HAVE TO FINE THEM FOR THAT. 
THIS IS A GAME OF RULES AND 
CONVENTIONS, AND UNFORTUNATELY, 
THOSE RULES AND CONVENTIONS 
COME TO ME TO ENFORCE.
AND WE WILL ENFORCE THEM. 
AND ON OCCASION WHEN I HAVE 
BEEN ASKED I OFTEN SAY THAT 
MARK HAS BEEN TERRIFIC FOR OUR 
LEAGUE IN TERMS OF THIS CITY OF 
DALLAS. 
HE CARES ABOUT THE GAME.
HE IS ENGAGED IN MAKING THE 
ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE HERE 
TERRIFIC. 
BUT TO ME THERE'S A FINE LINE 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU RUN 
THE RISK OF TAKING ATTENTION 
OFF THE PLAYERS.
AND EVEN CAUSING THE PLAYERS 
AND THE COACHING STAFF TO 
BECOME DISTRACTED.
AND I'M TRYING VERY HARD TO GET 
US TO HOWEVER MANY GAMES THIS 
IS GOING TO BE WITHOUT THOSE 
SETS OF DISTRACTIONS. 
>> FOR THE REST OF THAT 
INTERVIEW CHECK OUT "P.T.I." 
5:00 EASTERN ON ESPN. 
MEANWHILE, HEAT AND MAVS, GAME 
SIX DON'T.
LOOK FOR BIG NUMBERS FROM 
DWYANE WADE.
FLASH HAS SCORED 35 OR MORE IN 
THREE CONSECUTIVE GAMES.
JERRY STACKHOUSE RETURNING FOR 
DALLAS AFTER SERVING A ONE-GAME 
SUSPENSION. 
THE HOME TEAM HAS WON THE FIRST 
TIME GAMES OF THIS SERIES.
SO DOES CUBAN REALLY HAVE A 
CASE? 
WELL, THROUGH THE FIRST TWO 
GAMES OF THE NBA FINALS THE 
HEAT HAD ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED 
FEWER FREE-THROWS THAN THE 
MAVERICKS.
BUT WHEN THE SERIES SHIFTED TO 
MIAMI, THE CALLS SHIFTED TOWARD 
THE HEAT, CULMINATING IN A GAME 
FIVE. 
YOU SAW THE HEAT GO TO THE LINE 
ALMOST TWICE AS O AS THE MAVS.
DON'T FORGET GAME SIX TONIGHT 
ON ABC, COVERAGE STARTING AT 
8:30 EASTERN WITH THE CHEVROLET 
NBA PREGAME SHOW. 
TIP-OFF IS 9:00 P.M. EASTERN. 
AMARE STOUDEMIRE'S COMEBACK MAY 
LAND HIM IN SIN CITY. 
THE PHOENIX FORWARD IS WRAPPING 
UP THE FINAL WEEKS OF REHAB 
FROM KNEE SURGERY AND PLANS TO 
START ONE-ON-ONE PLAY NEXT WEEK 
SO THAT HE CAN HEAD TO LAS 
VEGAS FOR THE SUNS' SUMMER WEEK 
THAT BEGINS IN JULY.
BEN ROETHLISBERGER WAS AT 
STEELERS TEAM COMPLEX TODAY FOR 
THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE JUNE 
12 MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT THAT 
LANDED HIM IN THE HOSPITAL. 
HE DIDN'T TAKE PART IN ANY 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, BUT HE DID 
PICK UP HIS MAIL AND SOME 
ATHLETIC GEAR.
THE TEAM REMAINS OPTIMISTIC 
THAT BIG BEN WILL BE READY TO 
GO FOR THE STEELERS' OPENER ON 
SEPTEMBER 7.
MEANWHILE, WORLD CUP ACTION.
PARAGUAY AND TRINIDAD AND 
TOBAGO, THAT'S SANCHO.
SWEDEN AND ENGLAND. 
INTO THE NET. 
SO ENGLAND LEADING THIS MATCH 
1-0.
ENGLAND ALREADY IN THE ROUND OF 
16. 
THEY HAVEN'T BEATEN SWEDEN 
SINCE 1968. 
THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE 6-6-8 IN 
THEIR 20 ALL-TIME PLEADINGS.
-- MEETINGS.
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO TAKING ON 
PARAGUAY. 
THIS IS ASNCHO IN THE 25TH 
MINUTE. 
OH, THE HORROR. 
RIGHT NOW PARAGUAY LEADING 1-0. 
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO CAN FINISH 
SECOND AND ADVANCE TO THE 
ROUNDS OF 16 WITH A WIN.
GERMANY HAS ALSO PUNCHED ITS 
TICKET TO THE SECOND ROUND. 
THEY HAVEN'T LOST A MATCH IN 
GROUP PLAY SINCE 1986.
>> TO THE ACTION WE GO. 
>> THE TWO SIDES PLAYING FOR 
THE TOP SPOT IN GROUP A.
FOURTH MINUTE, BALL INSIDE THE 
BOX.
MIRSCLAFF KLOSE WITH THE GOAL.
KLOSE WITH THE FLIP.
LALIC FLIPS IT INTO THE BOX.
KLOSE BEATS THE DEFENDER AND 
THE GOALIE. 
THAT'S HIS SECOND GOAL OF THE 
MATCH.
GERMANY UP 2-0 AT THE MATCH.
SECOND MINUTE, LUKAS PODOLSKI 
FINISHING WITH THE LEFT FOOT. 
GERMANY WINNING 3-0.
FIRST PLACE IN GROUP A. 
GERMANY OFF TO ITS BEST WORLD 
CUP START IN 36 YEARS.
THE THREE GOALS WERE THE FIRST 
ALLOWED IN THE TOURNAMENT BY 
ECUADOR.
HOW ABOUT POLAND AND COSTA 
RICA? 
NEITHER OF THESE TEAMS CAN 
ADVANCE TO THE ROUNDS OF 16.
POLAND, WHO HAS YET TO SCORE A 
GOAL HASN'T HAD A WINLESS WORLD 
CUP SINCE 1938.
. ..
>> 33RD MINUTE. 
POLAND IN WHITE, TRAILING 1-0 
WITH A CORNER KICK. 
BOSACKI WITH -- HE MADE THAT 
LOOK SO EASY. 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
WATCH AS THE GOALIE GETS 
TRIPPED UP. 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A FOUL, BUT 
THE GAME IS TIED AT 1-1.
66TH MINUTE, ANOTHER CORNER FOR 
POLAND. 
BOSACKI THE HEADER AT THE FAR 
POST, HIS SECOND GOAL OF THE 
GAME. 
POLAND WINNING 2-1, ITS FIRST 
VICTORY OF 2006.
THIS IS COSTA RICA'S FOURTH 
STRAIGHT WORLD CUP LOSS.
BOTH POLAND AND COSTA RICA HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN ELIMINATED FROM 
THE WORLD CUP.
AND JOSH WILL KEEP YOU UP TO 
DATE ON THOSE TWO LATER MATCHES 
AND WE'LL KEY HOW EVERYTHING 
GOES. 
>> ENGLAND, ENGLAND, ENGLAND, 
1-0 RIGHT NOW OVER SWEDEN.
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO JUST KEEP 
HOPE ALIVE. 
THANKS A LOT, DANYELLE. 
STILL LOTS TO GET TO ON "THE 
HOTLIST," LOTS AND LOTS OF 
STUFF, INCLUDING A VISIT FROM 
OUR 
NFL FANTASY GURUS.}.{_o..p~oi.i.$o@SC_'3w?

>> WELCOME BACK TO "THE 
HOTLIST." 
I'M JOSH HE WILLIO. 
WE ARE PLEASED NOW TO BE JOINED 
FROM BALTIMORE, MARYLAND AS 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY CONTINUES. 
DAN UGGLA IS WITH US. 
AND DAN, FIRST THINGS FIRST.
THAT .314 AVERAGE, THAT MAKES 
YOU THE TOP HITTING ROOKIE TO 
DATE. 
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT FOR 
YOURSELF? 
>> SPRING TRAINING WAS JUST AN 
EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
IT WAS MY FIRST BIG LEGAL CAMP. 
THE MARLINS WERE KIND ENOUGH TO 
TAKE ME IN THE DRAFT AND GIVE 
ME A CHANCE TO BE THEIR OPENING 
DAY STARTER.
SPRING TRAINING IS JUST ABOUT 
GETTING COMFORTABLE AND THAT'S 
WHAT I DID. 
I PLAYED HARD AND I GUESS I DID 
ENOUGH TO WHERE JOE THOUGHT I 
COULD HELP HIM DURING THE 
SEASON. 
>> AND YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU 
WERE PICKED UP IN THE RULE FIVE 
DRAFT.
YOU'RE HEADING INTO YOUR CAMP 
AND THAT'S NICE.
BUT WHAT'S IT LIKE WHEN YOU ARE 
LESS AVAILABLE IN THE RULE FIVE 
DRAFT?
>> IT'S BEEN KIND OF A 
FRUSTRATING, NOT BEING PUT ON 
THE ROSTER. 
BUT I'VE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR THE 
RULE FIVE DRAFT THE LAST COUPLE 
OF YEARS. 
BUT THIS YEAR THE NUMBERS AND 
THE PLACES WHERE I PUT UP THE 
NUMBERS HAVE KIND OF FIT SO 
WHERE I WAS IMPRESSING PEOPLE 
AND CONVINCED THEM TO GIVE ME A 
SHOT. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
SO YOU WERE JUST ONE OF THE 
MANY REASONS THAT ALL THE 
NAYSAYERS, ALL OF US HERE IN 
THE MEDIA WERE SAYING IT'S OVER 
FOR THE MARLINS BEFORE IT EVEN 
BEGINS. 
YOU GUYS WERE BEAT UP FOR 
DUMPING SALARY, GOING WITH ALL 
THAT YOUTH. 
HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOU?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, US BEING SO 
YOUNG, IT DOESN'T BOTHER US.
I MEAN, WE ARE EXCITED TO BE 
HERE IN THE BEGIN.
SO WE CAME TO THE PARK WITH A 
LOT OF CONFIDENCE.
WE KNEW WHAT KIND OF TALENT WE 
HAVE. 
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF TAL LEN OF 
THE WHEN THE MARLINS WANT TO 
REBUILD, THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF 
GETTING SOME OF THE OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS' TOP PROSPECTS. 
THINGS ARE STARTING TO COME 
TOGETHER. 
>> A LOT OF PROSPECTS, 
ACTUALLY. 
YOU'VE ALREADY PLAYED 18 
ROOKIES.
YOU HAD THE YOUNGEST OPENING 
DAY ROSTER IN HISTORY.
SO I WONDER, FOR LIKE THE FOUR 
VETS YOU HAVE IN THAT 
CLUBHOUSE, HOW DO THEY TREAT 
YOU, SINCE THEY ARE SO 
INCREDIBLY OUTNUMBERED? 
>> OUR VETERANS ARE GREAT.
THEY'RE ALL GREAT GUYS AND THEY 
JUST, YOU KNOW -- THEY'RE NOT 
TRYING TO HAZE US.
THEY JUST WANT US TO LEARN, 
LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE GAME 
RIGHT AND LEARN HOW TO RESPECT 
THE GAME AND DO IT RIGHT IN THE 
BIG LEAGUES.
AND THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF 
GREAT GUYS TO BE AROUND.
>> THOSE FOUR GUYS ARE AWFUL 
THE MARLINS RIGHT NOW, IN FACT. 
I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO MAY 
12. 
MY APOLOGIES, 9-24. 
SINCE THEN YOU'VE GOT 20-13, AN 
EIGHT-GAME WIN STREAK RIGHT 
NOW.
WHAT CLICKED? 
>> WELL, I'LL AT THE TIME YOU 
WHAT. 
WE WERE IN A LOT OF CLOSE 
BALLGAMES AND WE FELL ON THE 
LOSING SIDE OF SOME OF THOSE. 
WE LOST LIKE SEVEN IN A ROW, I 
THINK, COME-FROM-BEHIND 
VICTORIES WHERE TEAMS BEAT US 
IN THE EIGHTH OR NINTH INNINGS. 
IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING TIMELY 
HITS. 
AND SINCE WE LOST THOSE SEVEN 
IN A ROW, OUR PITCHING STAFF 
HAS JUST DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE 
JOB OF KEEPING US IN THE 
BALLGAME AND GIVING US A CHANCE 
TO WIN EVERY GAME.
>> YOU LOOK AT THE METS.
AND THUS FAR THEY SEEM TO BE 
KINDS OF RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS 
DIVISION. 
SO I WONDER, WHAT'S YOUR 
MINDSET FROM DAY TO DAY?
>> THE METS ARE A GREAT BALL 
CLUB. 
THEY HAVE BEEN FROM THE 
BEGINNING.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE JUST WANT TO 
KEEP PLAYING OUR GAME, WE WANT 
TO KEEP WINNING BALLGAMES.
YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF SEE 
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE LAST 
MONTH OF THE SEASON.
BOTTOM LINE IS WE JUST WANT TO 
GIVE OURSELVES A CHANCE IN 
SEPTEMBER.
>> ALL RIGHT. 
SO YOU SAID IT, OR YOU 
CERTAINLY SEEM TO SORT OF 
SUGGEST IT. 
YOU'RE 29-37 RIGHT NOW. 
COME THAT LAST MONTH, IF YOU 
KEEP TS HOT STREAK UP, DO YOU 
START LETTING YOURSELF THINK 
PLAYOFFS? 
>> WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT 
YOU HAVE TO THINK AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE SEASON, YOU 
KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO BE -- YOUR 
FOCUS IS WANTING TO WIN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP, AND THAT'S WHERE 
WE STARTED, AND THAT'S WHERE WE 
STILL ARE.
I KNOW EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S A 
LO SHOT.
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT PLAYING WITH 
THAT KIND OF ENTHUSIASM AND 
THAT KIND OF GOAL, THEN YOU 
REALLY SHOULDN'T BE PLAYING.
>> I MENTIONED THE SALARY DUMP, 
AND IT STARTED HAPPENING PRETTY 
MUCH AFTER JOE GIRARDI ARRIVED 
THERE AS MANAGER. 
BUT HE'S REALLY BEEN THE GUY TO 
LEAD YOU THIS YEAR. 
IT'S ACTUALLY HIS FIRST YEAR AS 
A MANAGER.
WHAT'S HE MEANT TO YOUR CLUB? 
>> I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT 
JOE.
I THINK HE'S THE PERFECT GUY 
FOR THIS JOB. 
HE'S YOUNG, JUST LIKE WE ARE 
IT'S HIS FIRST TIME MANAGING. 
HE'S BEEN SO PATIENT WITH US. 
SOME OTHER MANAGERS MAY NOT 
HAVE BEEN.
AND HE JUST -- HE KNOWS HOW TO 
GET EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE IN 
US, TO LEAVE IT OUT ON THE BALL 
FIELD.
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT JOE. 
HE'S GIVEN ME THIS OPPORTUNITY 
AND A LOT OF US THIS 
OPPORTUNITY.
HE'S BEEN PATIENT AND, YOU 
KNOW, HE'S A GREAT MANAGER, AND 
I THANK HIM A LOT.
>> PLAYING INFIELD, TIMING WITH 
YOUR SHORTSTOP, ANOTHER ROOKIE, 
RAMIREZ, HIGHLY TOUTED, COMING 
OVER FROM THE RED SOX.
WHAT DID IT TAKE FOR THE TWO OF 
YOU TO MESH SO SEAMLESSLY?
>> IT'S KIND OF FUNNY, WE GOT 
ALONG GREAT FROM THE GIT-GO.
HE'S AN UNBELIEVABLE ATHLETE. 
HE IS OUR LEADOFF GUY.
HE GETS ON, HE'S SECOND OR 
THIRD IN THE LEAGUE IN STOLEN 
BASES.
YOU KNOW, ALL WE DO, WE JUST 
TALK EVERY DAY, WHETHER IT'S ON 
OR OFF THE FIELD. 
YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS JUST TRY TO 
GET -- TRY AND GET TO KNOW EACH 
OTHER A LITTLE BIT BETTER EVERY 
DAY, AND I THINK WE WORK REAL 
WELL TOGETHER.
>> SO YOU'RE A ROOKIE.
I'M NOT GOING TO CALL YOU 
IMMEDIATE, BUT I'M GOING TO ASK 
YOU, WHAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST 
SURPRISE PLAYING AT THE MAJOR 
LEAGUE LEVEL? 
>> THE BIGGEST SURPRISE?
HOW GOOD THE TALENT IS UP HERE. 
HOW GOOD THE TALENT IS AND, YOU 
KNOW, HOW WELL YOU GET TREATED. 
PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO OUT OF THEIR 
WAY TO DO STUFF FOR YOU.
IT'S BEEN PRETTY IMPRESSIVE TO 
ME. 
>> DAN UGGLA, BREAKING NEWS, 
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES ARE 
TREATED WELL IN THIS COUNTRY. 
I GOT TO KNOW.
MIAMI, CERTAINLY THE CENTER OF 
THE BASKETBALL WORLD FOR THE 
PAST WEEK.
WHAT'S THE HEAT'S RUN BEEN LIKE 
FOR YOU AND THE OTHER ATHLETES 
THERE IN MIAMI? 
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
THE MIAMI HEAT, THEY'RE JUST 
ATTRACTING MORE ATTENTION DOWN 
IN SOUTH FLORIDA AND IT'S FUN 
TO WATCH THEM, YOU KNOW.
THEY HAD A THREE-GAME RUN, AND 
THEY'RE JUST -- THEY'RE PLAYING 
THEIR HEARTS OUT AND I HOPE 
THEY CAN GO TO DALLAS AND TAKE 
THE LAST GAME.
>> YOU KNOW, DAN, THE CLUB HAS 
BEEN GRANTED APPROVAL BY 
BASEBALL TO SEEK OUT RELOCATION 
OPTIONS.
I WONDER. 
I KNOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST YEAR, 
BUT HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT TO 
STAY IN SOUTH FLORIDA?
>> THIS IS A TEAM THAT BROUGHT 
ME TO THE BIG LEAGUES.
I WANT TO STAY IN SOUTH 
FLORIDA.
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A STADIUM 
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
I LOVE IT DOWN THERE. 
I THINK IT'S WHERE WE ALL WANT 
TO STAY.
IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO PLAY 
BASEBALL. 
IT'S JUST A NICE AREA.
>> WELL, I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU 
STAY, TOO, DAN. 
UNFORTUNATELY, GOT TO MOVE ON 
AND YOU'VE GOT A GAME TONIGHT 
AGAINST THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES.
TOP-HITTING ROOKIE AS WE SPEAK. 
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE YEAR SO 
FAR.
>> THANKS A LOT, JOSH.
>> ALL RIGHT. 
STILL LOTS TO GET TO, INCLUDING 
-- WELL, UP NEXT, FOOTBALL, NFL 
FOOTBALL, NFL FANTASY FOOTBALL, 
JER ERICKSON AND ERIC KARABELL. 
THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS FOR 
CC
( whistle blows )
BREAK TIME!
WRAP IT UP!

- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.

AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THE 
DOCTORS SAY, BILL COWHER SAYS 
THAT. 
LET'S POINT THIS OUT. 
HE WAS NOT A TOP-10 QUARTERBACK 
TO START WITH.
SO IF ROETHLISBERGER IS YOUR 
STARTING QUARTERBACK, THAT'S 
NOT THE WORST THING IN THE 
WORLD THAT HE'S NOT ONE OF THE 
TOP ONES. 
THIS IS A RUNNING TEAM. 
I DON'T EXPECT THAT 
ROETHLISBERGER'S ACCIDENT IS 
GOING TO AFFECT HIM PHYSICALLY 
A WHOLE LOT AS THE SEASON 
STARTS. 
HE SHOULD BE READY FOR OPENING 
DAY.
YOU MAY WANT TO DROP HIM DOWN A 
COUPLE OF SPOTS BECAUSE WE 
DON'T KNOW FOR SURE RIGHT NOW.
LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR.
ROETHLISBERGER'S FANTASY VALUE 
FROM THE START WASN'T AS A TOP 
10 GUY. 
SHOULD I HATE THE PICK OF 
CARSON PALMER?
IS HE WORTH THE RISK? 
>> QUARTERBACK, CARSON PALMER, 
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS INJURY.
WE'RE OPTIMISTIC HE WILL BE 
READY FOR WEEK ONE. 
WE'RE NOT SURE OF IT. 
MAKE SURE YOU GET ONE OF THE 
TOP BACK-UP QUARTERBACKS, JON 
KITNA, SOMEBODY WHO CAN START, 
WHO CAN PUT UP 20 TOUCHDOWNS AT 
LEAST.
PALMER I THINK IN THE THIRD OR 
FOURTH QUARTERBACK OFF THE 
BOARD IN MOST LEAGUES.
BE SURE YOU GET SOMEBODY FOR 
THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS IN 
CASE HE DOESN'T COME BACK 
STRONG. 
>> BEING A WISH DOESN'T OFTEN 
TRANSLATE IN FANTASY. 
MIGHT HE NOT BE THE RAVENS' 
STARTER?
>> THEY BROUGHT HIM IN, SIGNED 
HIM TO A FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT AND 
THEY WANT HIM TO LEAD THE TEAM. 
IT'S A GOOD DEFENSE ALREADY.
MCNAIR, EVEN WHEN HE WAS THE 
2003 CO-M.V.P. HIS NUMBERS WERE 
OK IN FANTASY, BARELY A TOP 
FIVE, TOP 10 QUARTERBACK AT 
THAT POINT. 
HE'S A GOOD BACK-UP.
GET HIM IN ROUND 12, ROUND 14 
BUT DON'T ON HIM TO PLAY EVERY 
DAY.
HE'S ALWAYS GETTING HURT. 
>> ANOTHER GUY, THE GOOD AND 
THE BAD, DREW BREES, NEW 
ORLEANS COUNTING ON HIM TO BE 
THEIR NUMBER ONE. 
HE'S REHABBING THAT SHOULDER. 
YOU WONDER HOW GOOD THE TEAM IS 
GOING TO BE SO THEY WILL 
PROBABLY BE THROWING A LOT, BUT 
IS HE WORTH THE RISK AS A 
NUMBER ONE? 
>> I DON'T WANT HIM AS MY TOP 
QUARTERBACK IN FANTASY. 
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN'T 
EVENTUALLY HAVE VALUE THERE.
I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED 
ABOUT BREEZE'S SHOULDER AND IT 
WASN'T THE STRONGEST SHOULDER 
TO START WITH ANYWAY. 
IT WAS A BREAKOUT SEASON. 
HE HAD ARGUABLY THE BEST 
RUNNING BACK AFTER SEAN 
ALEXANDER AND LARRY JOHNSON, 
MCALISTER, JOE HORN GETTING 
OLD, I DON'T KNOW IF DREW BREES 
IS IN THE BEST SITUATION TO 
SUCCEED.
HE'S A SOLID QUARTERBACK, 
PROBABLY THE TOP 15TH 
QUARTERBACK.
>> JOINED BY JEFF ERICKSON. 
WE'RE TALKING QUARTERBACKS HERE 
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS 
ONE.
DONOVAN MCNABB. 
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU HAVE 
MECHANIC NAB ON YOUR TEAM?
DO YOU KEEP HIM?
>> YOU KEEP HIM, CERTAINLY. 
HE'S COMING BACK FROM THE 
HERNIA INJURY BUT YOU DON'T 
DRABT HIM AS HIGH AS YOU WOULD 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO START A NEW 
LEAGUE, COMING BACK FROM THE 
HERNIA INJURY HE DOESN'T HAVE 
T.O. ANYMORE, HIS BEST RECEIVER 
IS PROBABLY REGGIE BROWN. 
THEY DIDN'T BRING IN NOBODY 
NOTEWORTHY EITHER FOR THAT 
MATTER. 
THERE IS NO REAL TOP RECEIVER 
THAT THEY GOT IN THE DRAFT 
CLASS.
HE'S NOT A TOP TWO, TOP THREE 
QUARTERBACK ANYMORE.
>> THIS NEXT ONE IS FOR BOTH OF 
YOU.
JEFF, CATCH YOUR BREATH.
BRETT FAVRE, TWO DIAMETRICALLY 
OPPOSED THEORYOS -- THEORIES ON 
BRETT FAVRE.
>> IF INTERCEPTIONS COUNT IN 
YOUR LEAGUE HE CAN BE A KILLER. 
HE'S GOING FOR A 30-30 SEASON.
LYNN DICKEY IS THE LAST GUY TO 
DO THAT, ALSO AT GREEN BAY. 
I THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE A 
BETTER YEAR THIS YEAR BUT THE 
OFFENSIVE LINE IS A MESS. 
THE RECEIVERS, AFTER JAVON 
WALKER IS GONE, DONALD DRIVER, 
WHO IS GOING TO RUN THE BALL. 
YOU DON'T MAKE FAVRE YOUR TOP 
PICK. 
HE GOES 16-20 QUARTERBACKS. 
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE 
GUNSLINGING ICON IN GREEN BAY?
>> HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BETTER 
RUNNING GAME THIS YEAR, THAT'S 
THE ONE POSITIVE, A HEALTHY 
AHMAN GREEN AND A HEALTHY NAJEH 
DAVENPORT BUT THE RECEIVER 
SITUATION IS AWFUL, THE LINE 
SITUATION IS AWFUL. 
30-30, GOOD IN BASEBALL, NOT SO 
GOOD IN FOOTBALL. 
>> I WAS DOWN THERE FOR 
DOLPHINS CAMP A COUPLE WEEKS 
AGO.
DAUNTE CULPEPPER LOOKS GOOD.
DEFINITELY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. 
SOME MIGHT SAY THIS IS A 
MIRACULOUS RECOVERY BUT IF I'M 
DRAFTING IN THAT FANTASY 
LEAGUE, SHOULD I BE CALLING THE 
NAME DAUNTE CULPEPPER, ERIC?
>> IT'S NOT A TRAGEDY TO CALL 
ANY NAME AT SOME POINT IN YOUR 
DRAFT BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO 
MAKE HIM YOUR FIRST PICK. 
THE QUARTERBACK LOT IS NOT 
STRONG THIS YEAR. 
I THINK IT'S LIKELY CULPEPPER 
WILL BE READY TO PLAY.
THE NUMBERS WERE PRETTY BAD 
BEFORE HE GOT INJURED AND YOU 
CAN SAY THERE IS DEFINITELY A 
DECLINE HERE BUT THERE ARE 
GREAT WEAPONS AROUND HIM, 
RONNIE BROWN, CHRIS CHAMBERS. 
CULPEPPER IS IN A POSITION TO 
SUCCEED BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE FOR 
THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS LIKE 
CARSON PALMER BECAUSE THERE IS 
NO GUARANTEE EXURP IS READY FOR 
OPENING WEEK. 
>> DAUNTE CULPEPPER WILL BE 
RUNNING AN OFFENSE THAT HE'S 
COMFORTABLE WITH. 
SCOTT LINEHAN, HIS OLD 
COORDINATOR IN MINNESOTA. 
I WONDER, JEFF ERICKSON, IF YOU 
TAKE DAUNTE CULPEPPER MUST YOU 
TAKE JOEY HARRINGTON AS WELL? 
>> YOU NEVER HAVE TO USE THE 
PHRASE MUST AND JOEY HARRINGTON 
TOGETHER. 
NO, I BELIEVE IN TYING GUYS 
TOGETHER IF IT'S A VINTAGE ST. 
LOUIS RAMS OFFENSE, YOU GRAB 
THE BACK-UP QUARTERBACK AS YOUR 
LAST PICK.
CHRIS CHAMBERS HAS SHOWN 
DEVELOPMENT BUT HARRINGTON IS 
NOT A MUST GRAB.
I WOULD MUCH RATHER GET A GUY I 
KNOW IS GOING TO START MOST OF 
THE SEASON IF NOT ALL OF THE 
SEASON. 
>> YOUR BRILLIANCE WAS 
APPRECIATED EVEN IF A TAD BIT 
LATE, ERIC KARABELL.
THANK YOU.
>> YOU'VE GOT IT. 
>> STILL LOTS TO COME ON "THE 
HOT LIST" INCLUDING GAME SIX 
TONIGHT.

>> WELCOME BACK TO "THE HOT 
LIST" THE HOT STORIES GAME SIX 
TONIGHT, TITLE HANGING IN THE 
BALANCE, MAVS-HEAT, COVERAGE 
STARTS TONIGHT 8:30 EASTERN ON 
ABC.
WE'LL PROBABLY BE HEARING A LOT 
ABOUT THIS MAN, MARK CUBAN 
FINED A QUARTER OF A MILLION 
DOLLARS BY THE NBA FOR REPEATED 
AND SERIOUS ACTS OF MISCONDUCT, 
AND TODAY IN THE WORLD CUP THE 
HOST NATION, GERMANY, THEY ARE 
SAFELY THROUGH. 
THEY WIN GROUP A WITH A 
DECISIVE WIN OVER ECUADOR.
[CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY 
ESPN, INC.] 
>> HI THERE.
WELCOME BACK TO "THE HOT LIST" 
IN THE ESPN NEWSROOM. 
WE HAVE A LOT AND WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE A LOT MORE, THE 
PIRATES' JASON BAY JOINING US, 
PETER GAMMONS WILL STOP BY TO 
TALK ROGER CLEMENS, A-ROD, HOW 
MUCH BETTER COULD IT GET? 
WE HAVE OTHER TOP STORIES THAT 
WE ARE FOLLOWING. 
TAKE A LOOK AT THEM.
AGAIN, JERRY STACKHOUSE HIS 
ONE-GAME SUSPENSION OVER. 
HE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE 
MAVERICKS TONIGHT IN GAME SIX.
>> DON'T FORGET THE CAROLINA 
HURRICANES. 
THEY WON THE STANLEY CUP, GAME 
SEVEN, THEY CAN'T EVEN CRACK 
OUR TOP STRS. 
MARVELOUS GAME, YOU -- TOP 
STORIES.
MARVELOUS GAME, BUT THAT'S A 
SMIDGEN OF WHAT'S HAPPENING 
TODAY.
DANYELLE SARGENT. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO START WITH 
THE NBA.
IF YOU SAW GAME FIVE BETWEEN 
DALLAS AND MIAMI THEN YOU SAW 
MARK CUBAN. 
THE MAVS OWNER HAS BEEN FINED 
$250,000 FOR WHAT THE LEAGUE IS 
CALLING "SEVERAL ACTS OF 
MISCONDUCT" FOLLOWING THAT 
GAME. 
THE FINE IS THE THIRD LARGEST 
EVER LEVIED BY THE NBA AND 
BRINGS CUBAN'S GRAND TOTAL TO 
MORE THAN $1.5. 
CUBAN COMMENTED ON THE FINE -- 
DAVID STERN COMMENTED ON THE 
SEGMENT.
>> IF OWNERS AND FANS AREN'T 
ALLOWED TO BE ON THE COURT 
VERBALLY ABUSING REFEREES, YOU 
HAVE TO FINE THEM FOR THAT. 
THIS IS A GAME OF RULES AND 
CONVENTIONS.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE RULES 
AND CONVENTIONS COME TO ME TO 
ENFORCE, AND WE WILL ENFORCE 
THEM, AND I -- ON OCCASION, 
WHEN I HAVE BEEN ASKED, I OFTEN 
SAY THAT MARK HAS BEEN TERRIFIC 
FOR OUR LEAGUE IN TERMS OF THIS 
CITY, AND DALLAS. 
HE CARES ABOUT THE GAME.
HE IS ENGAGED IN MAKING THE 
ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE HERE 
TERRIFIC. 
BUT THERE IS A FINE LINE OF 
RUNNING THE RISK OF TAKING THE 
ATTENTION OFF THE PLAYERS AND 
EVEN CAUSING THE PLAYERS AND 
COACHING STAFF TO BECOME 
DISTRACTED, AND I'M TRYING VERY 
HARD TO GET US TO HOWEVER MANY 
GAMES THIS IS GOING TO BE 
THROUGHOUT THOSE SETS OF 
DISTRACTIONS. 
>> DOES CUBAN HAVE A CASE?
HE WAS FINED $250,000 BY THE 
NBA MAKING IT THE 13TH TIME 
SINCE HE BOUGHT THE MAVS IN 
2000. 
>> HEAT-MAVS, GAME SIX, WHAT TO 
WATCH FOUR. 
DWYANE WADE SCORED 35 OR MORE 
IN THREE CONSECUTIVE GAMES. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE WILL RETURN 
FOR THE MAVS AFTER SERVING A 
ONE-GAME SUSPENSION FOR A 
FLAGRANT FOUL ON SHAQ.
THE HOME TEAM HAS WON THE FIRST 
FIVE GAMES OF THIS SERIES.
GAME SIX TONIGHT ON ABC.
COVERAGE STARTING AT 8:30 
EASTERN.
>> BEN ROETHLISBERGER WAS AT 
THE STEELERS TEAM COMPLEX TODAY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 
JUNE 12TH MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT 
THAT LANDED HIM IN THE 
HOSPITAL. 
DIDN'T TAKE PART IN ANY 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES BUT HE DID 
PICK UP MAIL AND ATHLETIC GEAR. 
THE TEAM REMAINS OPTIMISTIC 
THAT BIG BEN WILL BE READY TO 
GO FOR THE STEELERS' OPENER ON 
SEPTEMBER 7.
TO THE WORLD CUP, ENGLAND 
ALREADY INTO THE ROUND OF 16. 
THEY'LL WIN GROUP B WITH A WIN 
OR A TIE BUT THEY HAVEN'T 
BEATEN SWEDEN SINCE 1968. 
THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE 6-6-8 IN 
THEIR 20 ALL-TIME MEETINGS. 
JOE COLE IN THE 34TH MINUTE.
HE'S GOING TO PUT ENGLAND ON 
THE BOARD.
JUST PAST THE DIVING GOALIE.
ENGLAND LEADING 1-0.
FORWARD MICHAEL OWEN INJURED IN 
THE OPENING MINUTE. 
HE WAS REPLACED BY PETER 
CROUCH, SUBBED AGAIN IN THE 
FOURTH MINUTE.
SWEDEN CAN STILL WIN THE GROUP 
WITH A WIN OR BE ELIMINATED ON 
GOAL DIFFERENTIAL WITH A LOSS.
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO CAN FINISH 
SECOND AND ADVANCE TO THE ROUND 
OF 16 WITH A WIN AND A SWEDEN 
LOSS TO ENGLAND, AND TRINIDAD 
AND TOBAGO FINISHING WITH A 
GREATER GOAL DIFFERENCE THAN 
SWEDEN SO LOTS OF SCENARIOS 
TODAY.
FIRST HALF ACTION FROM PARAGUAY 
AND TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.
HOW ABOUT AN OWN GOAL.
BRENT SANCHEZ.
OH, THE HORROR. 
PARAGUAY LEADING THIS ONE 1-0.
PARAGUAY ALREADY ELIMINATED 
FROM EXTENSION BUT LOOKING TO 
EXTEND THEIR STREAK OF EARNING 
AT LEAST A POINT IN EVERY 
APPEARANCE IN WORLD CUP 
HISTORY.
GERMANY HAS ALSO PUNCHED A CARD 
TO THE SECOND ROUND.
EC WADORNEEDS JUST A TIE TO 
TAKE THE GROUP. 
THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN UP A GOAL IN 
THEIR LAST THREE WORLD CUP 
MATCHES.
THAT WOULD CHANGE THIS 
AFTERNOON.
IN THE FOURTH MINUTE, MIRASLAV 
KKLOSE. 
BEATS KLOSE AND BEATS THE 
GOALIE. 
GERMY UP 2-0. 
AT THE HALF.
ECUADOR WOULD NOT RECOVER.
LUCAS PADALSKI. 
GERMANY WINNING GIVING THEM A 
MAXIMUM NINE POINTS AND FIRST 
PLACE IN GROUP A, OFF TO ITS 
BEST WORLD CUP START IN 46 
YEARS.
>> POLAND-COSTA RICA. 
NEITHER OF THESE TEAMS CAN 
ADVANCE TO THE ROUND OF 16. 
COSTA RICA TRYING TO AVOID THE 
FIRST WINLESS WORLD CUP IN 
THEIR HISTORY, 33RD MINUTE, 
POLAND IN WHITE TRAILING 1-0 
WITH THE CORNER KICK. 
BARTOS BOSACKI. 
TAKEARTH LOOK.
COULD HAVE BEEN A FOUL BUT THE 
GAME IS TIED. 
66TH MINUTE.
ANOTHER CORNER, BOSACKI, 
ANOTHER HEADER. 
BOSACKI'S SECOND GOAL OF THE 
GAME. 
POLAND WINNING 2-1, ITS FIRST 
VICTORY OF 2006.
THIS IS COSTA RICA'S FOURTH 
STRAIGHT WORLD CUP LOSS.
BOTH POLAND AND COSTA RICA HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN ELIMINATED FROM 
WORLD CUP.
I SHOWED YOU THAT GOALER 
EARLIER IN THE ENGLAND-SWEDEN 
MATCH.
THAT MATCH NOW TIED UP, ENGLAND 
AND SWEDEN TIED AT 1-1. 
>> TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO -- YOU 
HAVE RUINED MY AFTERNOON. 
COME ON, GUYS.
>> IS THAT WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS 
FROM? 
>> LET'S SAY THEY WIN IT ALL. 
IS THE PARADE ON TRINIDAD OR 
TOBAGO? 
>> CARNIVALE? 
IT WILL BE A BIG PARTY. 
>> DANYELLE SARGENT.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT.
I'LL HAVE THE ANSWER OF 
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.
PLEASE STAY TUNED ON "THE HOT 
LIST."
PETER GAMMONS STOPPING BY 
SHORTLY.
>> WELCOME BACK TO "THE HOT 
LIST."
I'M JOSH ELLIOTT. 
WITH THE WORLD CUP, STANLEY 
CUP, NBA, UNTIL LAST NIGHT THE 
COLLEGE WORLD SERIES MAY HAVE 
BEEN GETTING SHORT SHRIFT BUT 
NO LONGER.
WE'RE JOINED BY ONE OF THE 
STARS IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA, NORTH 
CAROLINA PITCHER ANDREW MILLER, 
ALSO DETROIT TIGERS DRAFT IAN 
DREW MILLER.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP YOU IN 
COLLEGE FOR NOW, ANDREW.
WHAT'S IT MEANT FOR YOU GETTING 
TO OMAHA? 
>> IT MEANS OUR TEAM'S MET ALL 
OUR GOALS SO FAR. 
IT'S SOMETHING WE FELT COULD 
NEVER HAPPEN IN OUR FIRST 
YEARS, THEN WE FELT IT WAS AN 
OPTION THAT WE HAD A CHANCE TO 
MAKE IT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE 
HERE. 
>> IT SEEMS WITH ALL THE 
INCREASED COVERAGE, WE SEE THE 
SUPER REGIONALS NOW, AND IT 
SEEMS THAT EVERY TEAM WHO GETS 
THERE HAS LUCK FALL ON THEIR 
SIDE. 
WHAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING 
THAT'S HAPPENED ON YOUR ROAD TO 
OMAHA?
>> I WOULD HAVE TO DEFINITELY 
WITH -- TO GO WITH CHAD FLACK.
HE HAD HOME RUNS IN THE BOTTOM 
OF THE EIGHTH AND BOTTOM OF THE 
NINTH IN THE SUPER REGIONAL TO 
PUT US HERE.
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN BASEBALL. 
THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING. 
>> YOU'RE A GUY A LOT OF GUYS 
THOUGHT MIGHT GO NUMBER ONE, 
YOU ENDED UP GOING SIX TO THE 
DETROIT TIGERS AND I HAVE GOT 
TO TELL YOU, IN YEARS PAST THAT 
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A GOOD 
THING BUT NOW THEY'VE GOT THE 
BEST RECORD IN BASEBALL.
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FOUND 
OUT YOU WERE DRAFTED BY 
DETROIT?
>> A LITTLE SURPRISED BUT 
PRETTY MUCH HAPPY ALL TOGETHER. 
I THINK IT'S A PERFECT FIT FOR 
ME. 
I'M HAPPY TO BE A TIGER AND 
CAN'T. WAIT TO START PLAYING FOR 
THEM. 
I CAN'T WAIT TO FOCUS ON 
CAROLINA. 
>> WHAT SURPRISED YOU?
>> I DIDN'T HAVE TOO MANY TKS 
WITH DETROIT GOING INTO THE 
DRAFT SO THEY WERE A WILD CARD, 
AND WE WERE LOOKING DOWN THE 
BOARD, THEN THEY WENT AHEAD AND 
SELECTED ME SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT 
WAS A GOOD THING AND I'M HAPPY 
TO BE THERE.
>> AGAIN, WE'RE JOINED BY 
ANDREW MILLER HERE. 
COMPARISONS CAN OFTEN DAMN 
PROMISING YOUNG PLAYERS 
FOREVER.
YOU HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO RANDY 
JOHNSON.
WHEN I SAY RANDY JOHNSON, I 
CONTEXT TO YOU, WHAT DO YOU 
THINK?
>> I THINK I'M NOTHING LIKE 
HIM.
THAT'S A PRETTY LOFTY 
COMPARISON. 
I CAN'T COMPARE MYSELF TO HIM.
HE'S A HECK OF A LOT BETTER 
PITCHER THAN I AM.
I CAN ONLY HOPE TO BE SOMEWHERE 
NEAR HIS LEVEL SOMEDAY. 
>> ON MOST TEAMS YOU WOULD BE 
FAR AND AWAY THE BEST PITCHER 
ON YOUR STAFF.
DANIEL BARD, ANOTHER HIGH DRAFT 
CHOICE. 
WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING ONE PART 
OF SUCH A GREAT STAFF?
>> IT'S NICE. 
THE THREE OF US HAVE BEEN 
TOGETHER SINCE MY FRESHMAN 
YEAR. 
WE'RE ALL JUNIORS.
WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS. 
IT'S NICE TO GO OUT THERE AND 
KNOW ON THE WEEKEND EVEN IF I 
DON'T PITCH WELL BOTH OF THEM 
ARE GOING TO PITCH WELL AND WE 
HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN EVERY 
SERIES. 
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE, IS 
BECAUSE OF THAT.
>> ANDREW, IF YOU WATCH THE 
COLLEGE WORLD SERIES WE HEAR SO 
MUCH ABOUT HOW IT'S AMERICANA, 
IT'S THE HEART LAND, IT'S 
OMAHA.
WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR YOU, YOUR 
TEAM, FOR ALL THE TEAMS THERE 
BEING RECEIVED IN OMAHA SOME 
>> IT'S AWESOME.
THE HOSPITALITY IS JUST 
AMAZING.
WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT.
WE HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A 
WHILE, EVERYBODY CAME HERE NOT 
KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT, THE 
PEOPLE ARE SO NICE, THE SETUP 
IS AMAZING. 
THE ENTIRE CITY IS FOCUSED ON 
THIS ONE EVENT, YOU FEEL LIKE 
YOU'RE A MAJOR LEAGUER FOR A 
WEEK. 
>> YOU ARE, SORT OF.
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY, AT LEAST, 
TO BEING A MAJOR LEAGUER. 
IS THERE ANY ADDED PRESSURE?
DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO PERFORM 
NOT JUST TO HELP YOUR TEAM WIN 
A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP BUT 
ALSO TO PROVE THAT YOU DESERVE 
TO BE SUCH A HIGH DRAFT CHOICE? 
>> MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.
MOSTLY, MY PRESSURE IS FROM MY 
TEAMMATES.
I KNOW THEY WANT ME TO GO OUT 
AND PITCH WELL BUT I ASSUME 
THEY PROBABLY EXPECT ME TO GO 
OUT AND PITCH WELL AND I THINK 
IF I LET THEM DOWN, THEN I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, SO 
BASICALLY, MOST PRESSURE I GET 
I PUT ON MYSELF JUST TRYING TO 
WIN THE BALLGAME. 
>> A GREAT STAFF, ANOTHER GREAT 
STAFF, THE ATLANTA BRAVES FOR 
SO MANY YEARS WITH GLAVINE AND 
SMOLTZ AND MADDUX, THEY HAD A 
LOT OF COMPETITIONS THAT WENT 
ON IN THAT STAFF, ON THE GOLF 
COURSE, WHAT HAVE YOU.
I WONDER, ANY COMPETITIONS 
BETWEEN YOU ASK YOUR OTHER 
HERALDED STAFF MEMBERS? 
>> WE DON'T HAVE A REGULAR GOLF 
GAME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT 
I THINK WE PUSH EACH OTHER, AND 
I THINK WE CERTAINLY DON'T WISH 
THE OTHER PERSON NOT TO DO AS 
WELL, BUT YOU WANT TO KEEP 
ONE-UPING THE PERSON THAT 
PITCHED BEFORE YOU, SO THAT'S 
ALWAYS EXCITING AND IT'S PRETTY 
EASY TO PUSH EACH OTHER WHEN 
THE OTHER TWO GUYS ARE SO 
GREAT.
>> GIVE ME A SCOUTING REPORT. 
WE KNOW ABOUT NORTH CAROLINA 
BASKETBALL, ROY WILLIAMS THE 
COACH, HE'S BEEN IN OMAHA, HE'S 
BEEN WATCHING YOUR GAMES THIS 
YEAR. 
SO TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU GUYS 
NEED TO DO TO BRING HOME A 
TITLE FOR TAR HEEL BASEBALL?
>> WE'RE THREE WINS AWAY, SO I 
THINK IF WE GET THREE GOOD 
STARTS AND KEEP HITTING THE 
BALL LIKE WE'RE HITTING IT, IT 
SHOULDN'T BE TOO FAR AWAY, BUT 
THAT'S A LOT TO ASK, ESPECIALLY 
WITH THE TEAMS LEFT IN THIS 
TOURNAMENT, SO WE'LL HAVE TO 
WAIT AND SEE. 
>> CLEMSON-CAL STATE FULLERTON 
IN PROGRESS ON ESPN2. 
THE WINNER WILL FACE YOU GUYS, 
COME WEDNESDAY. 
WE MIGHT SEE YOU THURSDAY.
YOU'RE HOPING NOT TO PITCH 
UNTIL SATURDAY, THOUGH. 
WHENEVER YOU DO PITCH, ANDREW 
MILLER, AGAIN, WE APPRECIATE 
YOUR TIME TODAY.
CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING 
DRAFTED BY DETROIT -- 
CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING 
AFTED BY DETROIT, YEAH, I 
SAID IT, GOOD LUCK AS YOU GET 
THIS CLOSE TO A NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
ANDREW MILLER JOINING US. 
FANTASTIC.
AGAIN, THAT GAME, CAL STATE 
FULLERTON AND CLEMSON, 5:00 
START.
UP NEXT, PETER GAMMONS JOINS US 
TO TALK ABOUT ROGER CLEMENS.
YOU HUNGER FOR
A WHOLE NEW KIND OF SALAD
THAT OFFERS BIG, BOLD
FLAVOR IN EVERY BITE...
IF YOU'D LIKE TO DIG INTO
A MEDLEY OF CHOPPED
OVEN-ROASTED CHICKEN,
SAVORY BLEU CHEESE, CRISPY BACON
AND TOASTED ITALIAN FLATBREAD...
AND IF YOU BELIEVE A CHOPPED
SALAD WITH FLAVOR SO INTENSE
SHOULD ONLY BE EATEN
WITH A REAL FORK, 
THEN ENJOY 4 NEW FLATBREAD
CHOPPED SALADS
SERVED ONLY WITH REAL FORKS.
SERVED ONLY AT QUIZNOS.
>> WELCOME BACK TO "THE HOT 
LIST."
I'M JOSH ELLIOTT IN THE ESPN 
NEWSROOM, JOINED BY ONE OF MY 
ALL TIME FAVES, PETER GAMMONS, 
BASEBALL HALL OF FAMER, NORTH 
CAROLINA ALUM, PETER GAMMONS, 
WE JUST HAD ONE OF THE GREAT 
TAR HEEL FIREBALLERS, ANDREW 
MILLER, ON. 
I WONDER, HIS PRO PROSPECTS, HE 
GOES NUMBER SIX OVERALL TO 
DETROIT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM? 
>> THE ONLY REASON HE DIDN'T GO 
NUMBER ONE IS BECAUSE OF MONEY. 
KANSAS CITY DIDN'T WANT TO PAY 
HIM.
THAT'S FINE.
COLORADO. 
I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE A 
GREAT PRO PITCHER.
IT MAY TAKE HIM A LITTLE TIME 
TO DEVELOP HIS COMMAND. 
HE'S 6'8", SIBS 9, A GREAT 
ATHLETE, AN UNBELIEVABLE 
PERSON. 
THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM HE 
TOLD ME HIS IDOL WAS DONTRELLE 
WILLIS BECAUSE HE THINKS 
EVERYONE SHOULD LOVE THE GAME 
LIKE THAT AND HE'S GOING TO BE 
VERY GOOD.
THEY'RE SET UP, IF DANIEL BARD 
WINS TOMORROW THEY'RE SET UP TO 
GO MILLER, WOODARD AND BARD OUT 
IN OMAHA. 
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I WAS IN THE 
RED SOX CLUBHOUSE YESTERDAY 
AFTERNOON AND KYLE SNYDER 
WALKED IN, AND CURT SCHILLING 
WASN'T THERE SO HE HAS NO IDEA 
ELSE. 
SO I YELLED AT HIM BECAUSE I 
KNOW HIM FROM ALL THE WAY BACK 
IN THE CAPE LEAGUE, AND WE WERE 
KIDDING ABOUT CAROLINA BEING -- 
KYLE SNYDER RELEASED BY KANSAS 
CITY, WALKS IN AND WINS FOR THE 
RED SOX.
>> PETER GAMMONS IS VERY 
EXCITED ABOUT THE ALMA MATER. 
BEST OF LUCK FOR THE TAR HEELS. 
ROGER CLEMENS RETURNS THURSDAY. 
IT'S BEEN UP AND DOWN FOR HIM 
THROUGH THE THREE STARTS IN THE 
MINOR LEAGUES.
I WONDER, RIGHT NOW AS WE 
STAND, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS 
PROGRESS? 
>> I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
ONE THING THAT FASCINATED ME IS 
HIS SECOND START. 
HE DID A TON IN CORPUS CHRISTI 
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE TIRED 
BEFORE HE WENT INTO THE GAME. 
HE SAID HE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO 
REACQUAINT HIMSELF TO PITCHING 
THROUGH EXHAUSTION, AND ONLY 
ROGER WOULD THINK OF THAT, SO I 
THINK HE WILL BE FINE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT 
ISN'T FUN.
HE HAS TO FACE FRANCISCO 
LIRIANO WHO HAS THE BEST ARM OF 
ANY PITCHER IN BASEBALL.
>> LET'S STAY IN THE DIVISION.
THE YANKEES RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE 
SCUFFLING BUT THEIR SCUFFLING 
PALES IN COMPARISON TO THAT OF 
THEIR THIRD BASEMAN.
WE HAD ROB NEYER ON WHO SAID 
COUNTERINTUITIVELY HE IS A 
RATHER CLUTCH PLAYER, BUT I 
WONDER. 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS JUST 
WOEBEGOTTEN.
I WONDER HOW BAD MIGHT THIS 
GET?
>> I THINK HE WILL COME OUT OF 
IT BUT IT'S BEEN DEFENSIVELY, 
OFFENSIVELY.
HE PRESSES SO MUCH. 
OK, HE GETS HIT WITH A RUNNER 
IN SCORING POSITION WHEN 
THEY'RE AHEAD 7-2 BUT HE HAS 
STRUGGLED IN A LOT OF 
SITUATIONS. 
I THINK HE'S GOT TO RELAX AND 
JUST GO OUT AND BE HIMSELF AND 
STOP WORRYING ABOUT BEING IN 
DEREK JETER'S SHADOW, BUT EVEN 
THE PLAYERS ON THE TEAM SEE 
THAT HE'S PRESSING A LOT AND 
HE'S NEVER REALLY BEEN -- HE 
GOT BOOED A LITTLE BIT IN TEXAS 
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.
THIS IS PRETTY TOUGH ON HIM.
>> YOU HAVE JASON GIAMBI, 
ANOTHER PLAYER LIKE A-ROD WHO 
IS DEFENSIVE, HE DOES SEEM 
CONCERNED WITH HOW HE'S 
RECEIVED BY THE FANS. 
IS THAT NECESSARILY THE WAY TO 
GO PLAYING FOR THE NEW YORK 
YANKEES?
>> NO, BUT GIAMBI'S ALWAYS BEEN 
ABLE TO FIGHT THROUGH IT, AND 
HE'S DONE A LOT JUST BEING ABLE 
TO SAY, "OK." 
PLUS, HE NEVER GETS OUT OF 
HIMSELF.
HE DOESN'T START SWINGING AT 
BAD PITCHES.
HE DOESN'T GO OUT AND TRY TOO 
HARD. 
BECAUSE JASON'S HAD SUCCESS AND 
HE'S NEVER -- EVEN THOUGH HE'S 
ONE OF THE GREATEST HITTERS IN 
THE GAME HE'S NEVER BEEN PUT ON 
A PEDESTAL THE WAY A-ROD HAS, 
AND ALEX HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO 
BE LIKED. 
SOMETIMES YOU'VE JUST GOT TO 
NOT WANT TO BE LIKED. 
I REMEMBER NOLAN RYAN TELLING 
ME THAT HIS CAREER CHANGED WHEN 
HE GOT ON THE MOUND AND LEARNED 
THAT HE COULDN'T BE NOLAN 
RYANMENT HE HAD TO BE THIS 
NASTY GUY THAT THREW AT PEOPLE 
AND DID THINGS THAT ARE NOT 
PART OF HIS CHARACTER, AND 
A-ROD NEEDS TO DO THAT TOO. 
>> SO LESS STATESMAN, MORE 
CORNER, ANGRY DOG.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> MEANWHILE, IT DOESN'T MAYBE 
MATTER WHAT A-ROD DOES AT THE 
PLATE, THIS STAFF BEHIND THE 
SCENE LOOKS IN SHAMBLES, IT 
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BULLPEN, THE 
BULLPEN OF THE YANKEES IN 
COMPLETE AND TOTAL SHAMBLES.
RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF MOVES WE 
START APPROACHING THE JULY 31ST 
TRADE DEADLINE, WHAT ARE THEY 
THINKING? 
>> THEY'LL GOOT AND TRY TO FIND 
ANOTHER STARTING PITCHER HERE, 
AND THAT'S WHAT BRIAN IS 
LOOKING AT, A GUY LIKE MARK 
HENDRICKSON FROM TAMPA BAY WHO 
WILL PROBABLY BE TRADED IN THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. 
HE'S GOOD.
HE'S COME UP WITH A CUTTER AND 
A LEFTHANDER IN A DIVISION 
WHERE THERE AREN'T MANY 
LEFT-HANDED STARTING PITCHERS.
HE MAKES SENSE BECAUSE HE'S NOT 
A GUY YOU HAVE TO TRADE FOR.
JUAN MAY BE THEIR BEST PITCHER 
BEFORE IT'S OVER. 
RANDY IS IN AND OUT.
I BELIEVE THAT'S PHYSICAL MORE 
THAN ANYTHING.
HE NEVER REALLY ADMITS IT, BUT 
IT HAS TO BE. 
THEN YOU'VE GOT MUSSINA.
THE REST IS A STRUGGLE. 
THERE ARE TOO MANY INNINGS IN 
THE BULLPEN AND NOW YOU HAVE 
FARNSWORTH, DOTEL, HOW MUCH CAN 
THEY REALLY EXPECT WITH A GUY 
COMING OFF TOMMY JOHN?
USUALLY, THE COMMAND ISN'T 
THERE.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE THEM GO 
GET A STARTER, PROBABLY A 
MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD STARTER AND 
THEN GET BULLPEN HELP BEFORE 
IT'S OVER.
>> MOST OF YOU WERE PROBABLY 
SLEEPING WHEN IT HAPPENED, MATT 
CAIN LAST NIGHT A NEAR NO-NO 
FOR THE GIANTS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
SOMEBODY OTHER THAN JASON 
SCHMIDT.
THIS DIVISION CERTAINLY UP FOR 
GRABS.
MIGHT THIS BE A NICE NUMBER TWO 
GUY BEHIND SCHMIDT? 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
HE HAS A CHANCE TO BE A STAR 
PITCHER AND I THINK JUST HE 
CAME UP AND WAS VERY GOOD LAST 
YEAR AND HE STRUGGLED EARLY IN 
THE SEASON, STRUGGLED IN SPRING 
TRAINING. 
AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO DAVE 
RIGHETTI ABOUT IT.
HE SAID HE'S JUST GETTING A 
LITTLE AHEAD OF HIMSELF.
HE NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN.
RIGHETTI HAS DONE A GREAT JOB 
WITH HIM AM NOW.
HE IS A DOMINANT GUY. 
NOAH ROWRY IS A GOOD PITCHER. 
PEOPLE KEEP SAYING TO BRIAN 
SABEAN "ARE GUG TO TRADE JASON 
SCHMIDT?" 
AND HE'S GOING "WHAT DO YOU 
MEAN? 
WHY WON'T WE WIN THE DIVISION?
WE CAN WIN IT." 
I KNOW THAT'S THE WAY BRIAN 
THINKS. 
EVEN IF THEY HAVE A SLUMP 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE MORE 
THAN A COUPLE OF GAMES OUT OF 
FIRST PLACE COME THE END OF 
JULY, WHICH MEANS SCHMIDT 
PITCHES AND THEY WORRY ABOUT IT 
LATER, TAKE THEIR DRAFT 
CHOICES.
>> THE WEST.
WHO DO YOU LIKE?
THIS IS A DIVISION CLEARLY THE 
DODGERS AND PADRES ARE NOT 
WORLD-BEATERS, NOT 
DIVISION-BEATERS. 
RIGHT NOW WHO DO YOU LIKE?
>> I STILL LIKE THE DODGERS.
THE INFUSION OF ALL THE TALENT 
WITH THEIR YOUNG PLAYERS, I 
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE 
ENOUGH. 
THEY NEED TO GET ANOTHER 
STARTING PITCHER. 
THEY PROBABLY NEED A LITTLE 
MORE HELP FOR BROXTON AND BAEZ 
AT THE END. 
BUT I JUST -- ONCE EVERYBODY 
GETS BACK TO PLAYING, I REALLY 
LIKE THAT TEAM AND I THINK GUYS 
LIKE DREW AND GARCIAPARRA AND I 
THINK YOU WILL SEE FURCAL HAVE 
A GREAT SECOND HALF -- HE WAS 
WORSE THAN THIS LAST YEAR IN 
THE FIRST HALF. 
PEOPLE FORGET THAT. 
I THINK THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO WIN 
IT, BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO 
BE A VERY GOOD RACE.
THE PADRES KEEP -- THEIR 
PITCHING'S BEEN BETTER THAN 
PEOPLE THOUGHT. 
COLORADO WAS DANGEROUS, AND 
ARIZONA WILL TURN THIS THING 
AROUND. 
I THINK THAT WHOLE GRIMSLEY 
THING GOT THEM A LITTLE OUT OF 
KILTER. 
THE PITCHING GOT OUT OF KILTER. 
BUT THEY HAVE GOT SO MUCH YOUNG 
TALENT, EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS 
THE DODGERS COMING UP THAT THEY 
CAN DO A COUPLE OF THINGS THE 
LAST TWO MONTHS OF THE SEASON.
>> WHEN EVERYBODY IS .500 IT 
ACTUALLY IS A GOOD RACE.
PETER GAMMONS, OUR HALL OF 
FAMER, APPRECIATE IT. 
>> THANKS A LOT.
>> STILL LOTS MORE TO GET TO 
HERE ON "THE HOT LIST." 
GAME SIX.

GAME SIX TONIGHT. 
TITLE HANGING IN THE BALANCE. 
MAVS-HEAT FOR MOST IF NOT ALL 
OF THE MARBLES. 
ABC.
BEGINS AT 8:30 EASTERN WHERE 
THEY WILL MOST LIKELY BE 
TALKING ABOUT THIS. 
DALLAS MAVERICKS OWNER MARK 
CUBAN FINED A QUARTER OF A 
MILLION DOLLARS BY THE NBA. 
AND GERMANY BEATS ECUADOR, THUS 
WINNING GROUP A.
THE HOSTS ARE SAFELY THROUGH. 
THEY WAIT FOR ENGLAND, SWEDEN 
-- 
[CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY 
ESPN, INC.] 
>> HI THERE.
I'M JOSH ELLIOTT. 
WELCOME BACK TO "THE HOT LIST." 
IT REMAINS HOT. 
JASON BAY, PIRATES CENTER 
FIELDER WILL BE JOINING US. 
AND JOHN CLAYTON, THE 
PROFESSOR, WITH ALL THE NFL 
NEWS AND NOTES THAT YOU NEED TO 
KNOW, BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. 
THAT'S NOT ALL. 
NOT BY A LONG SHOT, NO, NO, 
IT'S NOT. 
JERRY STACKHOUSE COMING BACK 
TONIGHT.
HIS ONE-GAME SUSPENSION OVER. 
SO THE MAVS' SUPERSUB WILL BE 
BACK. 
AGAIN, AS I MENTIONED, GERMANY 
WINNING GROUP A.
THEY ARE GOING TO WAIT TO PLAY 
EITHER ENGLAND, SWEDEN OR 
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.
WE'LL SEE A LITTLE LATER. 
AND BEN ROETHLISBERGER, SOME 
VERY ENCOURAGING NEWS.
HE VISITED THE STEELERS 
FACILITY TODAY. 
WHY?
DANYELLE SARGENT IS GOING TO 
TELL US ABOUT IT. 
SARGE?
BEN ROETHLISBERGER, A WEEK AGO, 
10 DAYS AGO WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT 
BE FAR MORE SERIOUS BUT HE'S 
UP, HE'S MOVING, DROPPING BY 
THE FACILITY. 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THAT AND MANY 
OTHER THINGS. 
>> FIRST OFF, MARK CUBAN'S 
POCKET'S A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER.
FUSAW GAME FIVE BETWEEN DALLAS 
AND -- IF YOU SAW GAME FIVE 
BETWEEN DALLAS AND MIAMI, YOU 
SAW MARK CUBAN. 
HE'S BEEN FINED $250,000 FOR 
"SEVERAL ACTS OF MISCONDUCT" 
FOLLOWING THE GAME. 
IT BRINGS CUBAN'S GRAND TOTAL 
TO MORE THAN $1.5 MILLION.
EARLIER TODAY COMMISSIONER 
DAVID STERN COMMENTED ON THE 
FINES DURING A TAPED SEGMENT 
FOR P.T.I. 
>> IF FANS AND OWNER -- FOR 
"P.T.I.." 
>> IF FANS AND OWNERS AREN'T 
ALLOWED TO BE UPON OUT ON THE 
COURT VERBALLY ABUSING 
REFEREES, YOU HAVE TO FINE THEM 
FOR THAT. 
THIS IS A GAME OF RULES AND 
CONVENTIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY, 
THOSE RULES AND CONVENTIONS 
COME TO ME TO ENFORCE, AND WE 
WILL ENFORCE THEM, AND ON 
OCCASION, WHEN I HAVE BEEN 
ASKED, I OFTEN SAY THAT MARK 
HAS BEEN TERRIFIC FOR OUR 
LEAGUE IN TERMS OF THIS CITY, 
DALLAS, HE CARES ABOUT THE GAME 
, HE IS ENGAGED IN MAKING THE 
ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE HERE 
TERRIFIC, BUT TO ME, THERE IS A 
FINE LINE, BECAUSE I THINK THAT 
YOU RUN THE RISK OF TAKING 
ATTENTION OFF THE PLAYERS AND 
EVEN CAUSING THE PLAYERS AND 
THE COACHING STAFF TO BECOME 
DISTRACTED. 
I'M TRYING VERY HARD TO GET US 
TO HOWEVER MANY GAMES THIS IS 
GOING TO BE WITHOUT THOSE SETS 
OF DISTRACTIONS.
>> FOR THE REST OF THAT 
INTERVIEW, CHECK OUT "P.T.I." 
5:30 EASTERN ON ESPN. 
MARK CUBAN FINED $250,000 BY 
THE NBA TODAY, THAT'S THE 13TH 
TIME SINCE HE BOUGHT THE MAVS 
IN 2000.
THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME CUBAN 
HAS EARNED A FINE OF AT LEAST 
$200,000. 
HEAT AND MAVS, GAME SIX 
TONIGHT.
>> LOOK FOR BIG NUMBERS FROM 
DWYANE WADE.
JERRY STACKHOUSE WILL RETURN 
FROM THE MAVS AFTER SERVING A 
ONE-GAME SUSPENSION FOR A 
FLAGRANT FOUL ON SHAQ.
THE HOME TEAM HAS WON THE FIRST 
FIVE GAMES OF THIS SERIES.
GAME SIX TONIGHT ON ABC.
>> BEN ROETHLISBERGER WAS AT 
THE STEELERS TEAM COMPLEX FOR 
THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT THAT LANDED 
HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.
HE DIDN'T TAKE PART IN ANY 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BUT HE DID 
PICK UP SOME OF HIS MAIL AND 
ATHLETIC GEAR.
THE TEAM REMAINS OPTIMISTIC 
THAT BIG BEN WILL BE READY TO 
GO FOR THE STEELERS OPENER ON 
SEPTEMBER 7TH.
WORLD CUP ACTION FOR YOU, 
ENGLAND ALREADY THROU TO THE 
ROUND OF 16.
THEY'LL WIN GROUP THREE WITH A 
-- GROUP B WITH A WIN OR A TIE. 
THEY HAVEN'T BEATEN SWEDEN 
SINCE 1968. 
ACTION TODAY, 34TH MINUTE, JOE 
COLE WITH THE GOAL RIGHT THERE 
AND NOW POVERPBST MINUTE, 
THAT'S MARCUS ALBACK -- MARCUS 
ALLBACK TYING THINGS UP.
THIS MATCH ALL TIED AT 1-1. 
ONE NOTE, MICHAEL OWEN INJURED 
IN THE OPENING MINUTE AND HE 
WAS SUBBED FOR AND REPLACED BY 
PETER CROUCH. 
ALSO TODAY, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO 
CAN FINISH THE SECOND ROUND -- 
CAN FINISH SECOND AND ADVANCE 
TO THE ROUND OF 16, WITH A WIN. 
>> TAKING ON PARAGUAY TODAY, 
25TH MINUTE.
OH, THE WORST THING THAT COULD 
POSSIBLY HAPPEN.
THAT'S AN OWN GOAL BY BRENT 
SANCHEZ PUTTING PARAGUAY UP 1-0 
AND THAT'S WHERE WE STAND RIGHT 
NOW.
AGAIN, BRENT SANCHEZ WITH THAT 
OWN GOAL RIGHT THERE. 
PARAGUAY DID RECEIVE A YELLOW 
CARD IN THE 35TH MINUTE BY 
CARLOS HUMBERTO PAREDES.
>> GERMANY TAKING ON ECUADOR. 
GERMANY HADN'T -- EQUAHADN'T 
GISH UP A GOAL IN THEIR LAST 
THREE MATCHES.
KLOSE CELEBRATING WITH A GOAL.
HIS SECOND GOAL.
GERMANY 2-0 AT THE HALF.
SECOND HALF, 57TH MINUTE, LUCAS 
PODOLSKI. 
GIVING THEM THE MAXIMUM NINE 
POINTS AND FIRST PLACE IN GROUP 
A, GERMANY OFF TO ITS BEST 
WORLD CUP START IN 36 YEARS.
THE THREE GOALS ALLOWED WERE 
THE FIRST THREE ALLOWED IN THE 
TOURNAMENT BY ECUADOR.
POLAND-COSTA RICA.
NEITHER OF THESE TEAMS CAN 
ADVANCE TO THE ROUND OF 16. 
POLAND HAD YET TO SCORE A GOAL 
ENTERING THIS MATCH.
THEY HADN'T HAD A WINLESS WORLD 
CUP SINCE 1938. 
THESE TWO GOING HEAD TO HEAD 
TODAY, COSTA RICA TRYING TO 
AVOID THE FIRST WINLESS WORLD 
CUP IN THEIR HISTORY, 33RD 
MINUTE, POLAND IN WHITE, THE 
CORNER KICK, BARTOS BOSACKI 
VOLLEYING THAT IN FOR THE GOAL, 
TYING THE SCORE AT 1-1. 
POLAND AND BOSACKI'S FIRST GOAL 
OF THE WORLD CUP. 
66TH MINUTE, ANOTHER GOAL FOR 
POLAND, HEADER FROM THE FAR 
POST, HIS SECOND OF THE GAME, 
POLAND TAKES IT 2-1, THE FIRST 
VICTORY OF 2006, CROAST'S 
FOURTH STRAIGHT WORLD CUP LOSS. 
BOTH POLAND AND COSTA RICA HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN ELIMINATED FROM 
THE WORLD CUP.
LET'S GET "NEWSWIRED."
ABSENT FROM BEARS WORKOUTS FOR 
THE LAST TWO WEEKS, PRO BOWL 
CORNERBACK NATHAN VASHER 
RETURNED FOR THE FINAL THREE 
DAYS SUGGESTING THAT HIS 
BOYCOTT GOT THE ATTENTION OF 
TEAM OFFICIALS AND AN ALREADY 
STAR-STARVED BOOZE BOOZE 
>> STAR-STARVED BOOZ ALLEN 
CLASSIC, MORE STARVED WITH 
SERGIO GARCIA'S RETURN.
>> WHERE THE CUP WILL BEGIN IN 
CAROLINA AGAIN, GO CAROLINA 
HURRICANES, GREAT STANLEY CUP.
I DON'T KNOW. 
IT'S EITHER THAT OR TRINIDAD 
AND TOBAGO. 
DANYELLE FRANCE -- 
>> DID YOU CALL ME -- 
>> I DID. 
DANYELLE SERGEANT.
NEVER MIND. 
SETTLE DOWN.
LOTS MORE "HOT LIST" STILL TO 
COME. 
IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR, RIC 
BUCHER IS GOING TO JOIN US. 
HE WILL HAVE THE LATEST ON THE 
FINED MARK CUBAN, $250,000 BY 
THE NBA.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- HEY, STU. WHAT'S UP?
HEY, A SUPPLIER
GAVE ME THESE.
AND I FIGURED
IF ANYBODY COULD USE
THEM, YOU COULD.
OH YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
THANKS.
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD OR NOT.
- THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK THEM.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
( laughing )
YEAH.
IT'S FUNNY, HUH?
REAL FUNNY.
>> WELCOME BACK TO EQUALITY THE 
HOT LIST," 
>> WELCOME BACK TO "THE HOT 
LIST", JOSH ELLIOTT, DRAWING TO 
THE CLOSE OF GROUP PLAY IN 
GERMANY, DRAWING TO THE MOMENT, 
I HAVE UP-TO-DATE SCORING, 
GERMANY 2-1 IN THEIR GAME OVER 
-- ENGLAND, 2-1 IN THEIR GAME 
OVER SWEDEN.
SEAN, GROUP PLAY DRAWING TO A 
CLOSE.
WHAT DO YOU AS A THINKING MAN?
>> AS A THINKING MAN YOU END UP 
THINKING ABOUT THE GAMES IN 
DIFFERENT WAY AND I THINK 
ARSENAL, THEY'RE WINNING THE 
ENTIRE WORLD CUP. 
THEY'VE GOT FIVE GOALS RIGHT 
NOW.
IT'S LIKE A REALLY INTERESTING 
WAY TO LOOK AT THE TEAMS, 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ARSENAL 
EVERYWHERE. 
REEVES SCORED ONE FOR THEM. 
VAN PEARCY SCORED ONE, ROSICKY 
SCORED TWO SO IT'S A GREAT WAY 
TO LOOK AT THE CUP AND YOU CAN 
MAKE IT A KIND OF SMALL-TOWN 
THING BECAUSE YOU'RE ROOTING 
FOR YOUR HOME TEAM AND FOR YOUR 
COUNTRY.
>> HE'S DISCUSSING, OF COURSE, 
THE EUROPEAN CLUB TEAMS, ALL 
THESE PLAYERS PLAYING FOR THEIR 
COUNTRIES, MOST OF THEM PLAY 
ABROAD THERE AND MANY OF THEM 
PLAY IN EUROPE SO I WONDER. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DO 
WONDER ABOUT, ESPECIALLY -- 
WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR THESE 
PLAYERS THAT PLAY SIDE BY SIDE 
DURING THEIR LONG PREMIERSHIP 
SEASONS TO THROW ON THE 
NATIONAL COLORS AND GO HEAD TO 
HEAD? 
>> THE ENGLAND GAME THAT'S 
GOING ON NOW IS A GREAT EXAMPLE 
OF THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT 
ERICSSON FROM SWEDEN COACHING 
THE ENGLISH TEAM AGAINST THE 
SWEDES AND IN THE 2002 CUP 
NIKATA, PLAYS FOR JAPAN ON THE 
NATIONAL TEAM, AT THE TIME 
PLAYED FOR THITYLY ON A CLUB 
TEAM AND HE WOULD SHOUT AT 
PLAYERS IN ITALIAN. 
SO YOU GOT TO SEE THE WHOLE 
WORLD COMING TOGETHER.
YOU SEE THESE NATIONS PLAYING 
EACH OTHER BUT THEN ALL THE 
PLAYERS KNOW EACH OTHER FROM 
THEIR CLUB TEAMS, AND I THINK 
THAT MAKES IT A LOT MORE FUN 
AND MORE INTERESTING. 
>> I'M WITH YOU.
I'M WITH YOU. 
RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING ON THE 
SCREEN AT SOME OF THE TEAMS 
THAT HAVE DONE WELL SO FAR AND 
THEY HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON.
THEY'RE TRADITIONAL FAVORITES.
THE BIG DOGS, IF YOU WILL.
WHY DO YOU THINK ALL THESE 
TRADITIONAL FAVORITES HAVE 
DOMINATED PLAY? 
WHERE HAVE ALL OUR UPSETS GONE? 
>> I KNOW.
IT'S BEEN UPSET FREE AND 
UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY UPSET 
THAT YOU CAN KIND OF SEE ON THE 
HORIZON IS MAYBE GHANA GOING 
THROUGH, OR THE UNITED STATES, 
AND I WOULD SO LOVE TO SEE BOTH 
OF US GO THROUGH BUT IT'S A 
MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY, AND 
GHANA HAS PLAYED SO WELL, SO 
HAS IVORY COAST AND THEY WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A GREAT UPSET, NOT 
ONLY ARE THEY A GREAT TEAM AND 
THEY SORT OF DESERVE TO GO 
THROUGH BUT THE POLITICAL 
TENSION IN IVORY COAST HAS 
REALLY COME TO A STOP FOR THE 
WORLD CUP, AND NOW THAT THEY 
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO ADVANCE, 
IT'S NOT VERY LIKELY THAT 
THINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
BE GOOD IN THE IVORY COAST BUT 
YEAH, GERMANY LOOKING BETTER 
AND BETTER EVERY GAME.
ARGENTINA LOOKING UNBEATABLE. 
I THOUGHT THE AUSTRALIANS DID 
AMAZINGLY WELL AND WERE UNLUCKY 
NOT TO DO BETTER AGAINST 
BRAZIL. 
>> WE TALK ABOUT THE UNDERDOGS 
THAT WE DON'T HAVE, AND YOU 
JUST MENTIONED TWO OF THEM IN 
THE IVORY COAST AND GHANA, TWO 
AFRICAN NATIONS.
ARE THE DAYS THAT THE AFRICAN 
NATIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN 
UNDERDOG, IS THAT IN THE PAST?
NOW A LOT OF THESE TEAMS LOOK 
LIKE THEY'RE JUST HERE TO PLAY. 
>> I HOPE SO. 
I THINK OBVIOUSLY THE AFRICAN 
TEAMS REALLY CAME TO THE FOR IN 
19-- CAME TO THE FORE IN 1990 
WHEN CAMEROON DID SO WELL, 
SENEGAL DID WELL IN THE LAST 
WORLD CUP, TOGO, OBVIOUSLY, 
KIND OF THE LOW TEAM RIGHT NOW 
IN THE WHOLE TEAM AND JUST A 
TINY, TINY COUNTRY, IT'S LIKE 
THE SIZE OF A HALLWAY, AND 
LITERALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT IT 
IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLY SMALL 
AND THEY SHARE A BORDER WITH 
GHANA, AND IT'S KIND OF A WELL 
KNOWN FACT IN AFRICA THAT IF 
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ONTO THE 
GHANIAN TEAM YOU WILL PLAY ON 
THE TOGO TEAM WHICH IS KIND OF 
THE CASE RIGHT NOW. 
I THINK WITH THE CUP IN AFRICA 
IN 2010, THEY'RE GOING -- IT'S 
GOING TO BE VERY GOOD FOR 
AFRICA AND I THINK THEY WILL DO 
A LOT BETTER, BUT ONCE AGAIN, 
THIS IS A WORLD CUP WHERE ALL 
THE AFRICAN NATIONS ARE 
DEBUTANTES IN THE WORLD CUP.
>> SEAN WILSEY, WE STARTED THIS 
INTERVIEW IT WAS 1-1, NOW 
SWEDEN JUST SCORED TO TIE IT 
2-2.
IF WE GO A COUPLE MORE MINUTES 
IT'S GOING TO BE 5-4 IN EXTRA 
TIME. 
TV RATINGS ARE UP DRAMATICALLY 
OVER 2002 OWING IN PART, OF 
COURSE, TO THE FACT THAT A LOT 
OF THE GAMES CAN BE SEEN IN THE 
U.S. DURING THE DAY, WE CAN SEE 
THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY LIVE, 
BUT I WONDER, HOW MUCH OF IT 
CAN ALSO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
FACT THAT PERHAPS THE SPORT IS 
GAINING A FOOTHOLD IN THIS 
COUNTRY?
>> I THINK IT'S TOTALLY GAINING 
A FOOTHOLD IN THIS COUNTRY. 
WE CAN SEE THE GAMES DURING THE 
DAY, BUT OF COURSE EVERYBODY IS 
AT WORK DURING THE DAY ANYWAY, 
SO YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A REAL 
EFFORT TO GET AWAY FROM WORK 
AND SEE A GAME. 
I THINK THAT THE INCREASE IN 
VIEWERSHIP IS TOTALLY DUE TO 
THE FACT THAT MORE AND MORE 
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING SOCCER IN 
THIS COUNTRY THAT IT ACTUALLY 
HAS A HUGE FOLLOWING HERE.
THE U.S. GAMES, THE BARS WERE 
OVERFLOWING HERE IN NEW YORK 
WITH PEOPLE WATCHING THAT GAME 
AND -- AND YOU KNOW, I THINK WE 
PROVED THAT WE CAME INTO IT A 
LITTLE WEAK BUT WE PLAYED SO 
WELL AGAINST ITALY, AND 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL PLAY REALLY 
WELL AGAINST GHANA, AND I THINK 
THERE IS A BIG FOLLOWING HERE.
>> ALL RIGHT. 
SO YOU'RE THE THINKING FAN. 
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO LET 
YOU KEEP USING THE WORD "WE" IT 
MUST BE FUN TO DO THAT. 
I DO WONDER.
HOW DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN 
PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN RECEIVED 
THUS FAR OVER HERE IN THE 
STATES? 
>> I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE -- I 
THINK WE'RE JUST, LIKE, TOO 
QUICK TO JUMP ON THE TEAM.
WHEN THEY LOST TO THE CZECHS, 
IT WAS A BAD LOSS BUT 
IMMEDIATELY EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, 
"THEY'RE TERRIBLE.
THEY CAN'T PLAY AS WELL AS A 
FIRST-CLASS TEAM."
AND THEN IT WAS TOTALLY PROVED 
WRONG IN THE SECOND GAME. 
AND I THINK THAT IT PROVES THEY 
ACTUALLY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT 
AND THAT SOCCER'S ALL ABOUT 
SUFFERING.
THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN MY 
EXPERIENCE. 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET USED TO 
LOSING, MAYBE, FOR A LONG TIME 
BEFORE THINGS START TO TURN 
AROUND, AND WE'VE GOT A GREAT 
TEAM THAT ACTUALLY IS VERY 
CAPABLE OF WINNING AGAINST ANY 
TEAM IN THE WORLD, I THINK. 
>> SEAN WILSEY, LOOK AT THIS, 
ENGLAND MOVES AHEAD 3-2 -- NO, 
I'M KIDDING, I'M KIDDING. 
IT'S STILL TIED.
>> DON'T DO THAT TO ME. 
>> HENRIK LARSEN SCORES THE 
TIE, TIED AT 2-2, GOOD HAVING 
YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A PEEK. 
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE GOAL OFF 
A LONG THROW. 
IT TOUCHES DOWN TWICE AND 
TRICKLES IN.
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE THE GOAL 
TO HENRIK LARSSON, IT ALMOST 
BOUNCES INTO THE NET BEATING 
THE GOALIE.
>> STILL LOTS TO GET TO HERE.
}@
>> WELCOME BACK TO "THE HOT 
LIST. 
QUALITIES IF YOU'RE JUST WAKING 
UP TODAY HERE IS WHAT YOU 
MISSED, MARK CUBAN REACTING TO 
REPORTED COMMENTS AFTER GAME 
FIVE THAT THE GAME IS RIGGED.
>> THE FANS AND OWNERS AREN'T 
ALLOWED TO BE OCCUPANT ON THE 
COURT VERBALLY ABUSING 
REFEREES, THEN AS WE GET 
EARLIER IN THE SEASON YOU HAVE 
TO FINE THEM FOR THAT.
THIS IS A GAME OF RULES AND 
CONVENTIONS, AND UNFORTUNATELY, 
THOSE RULES AND CONVENTIONS 
COME TO ME TO ENFORCE, AND WE 
WILL ENFORCE THEM, AND ON 
OCCASION, WHEN I HAVE BEEN 
ASKED, I OFTEN SAY THAT MARK 
HAS BEEN TERRIFIC FOR OUR 
LEAGUE IN TERMS OF THIS CITY, 
DALLAS, HE CARES ABOUT THE 
GAME, HE IS ENGAGED IN MAKING 
THE ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE 
HERE TERRIFIC, BUT TO ME THERE 
IS A FINE LINE BECAUSE I THINK 
THAT YOU RUN THE RISK OF TAKING
ATTENTION OFF THE PLAYERS AND 
EVEN RUN THE RISK OF CAUSING 
THE PLAYERS AND THE COACHING 
STAFF TO BECOME DISTRACTED, AND 
I'M TRYING VERY HARD TO GET US 
TO HOWEVER MANY GAMES THIS IS 
GOING TO BE WITHOUT THOSE SETS 
OF DISTRACTIONS.
>> AGAIN, NBA COMMISSIONER 
DAVID STERN DISCUSSING THE FINE 
LEVIED AGAINST DALLAS OWNER 
MARK CUBAN. 
$250,000 FOR REPEATED ACTS OF 
MISCONDUCT. 
SO ALL OF THIS PROLOGUE FOR OUR 
FIRST ELIMINATION GAME OF THE 
NBA SEASON. 
GAME SIX, TONIGHT.
THE MAVS LOOKING TO PUT A 
DISASTROUS WEEK IN MIAMI BEHIND 
THEM. 
THE HEAT HOPING TO FINISH 
THINGS OFF NOW. 
FOR THE LATEST FROM DALLAS, WE 
WELCOME "ESPN THE MAGAZINE'S" 
RIC BUCHER, AND RICK, I WONDER, 
AGAIN, THIS FINE. 
QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS 
FOR MAVS OWNER MARK CUBAN.
YOUR REACTION?
>> IT'S IN LINE WITH OTHER 
FINES THEY HAVE HAD, AS DAVID 
STERN SAID, YOU DON'T WANT THE 
FOCUS TO BE ON THE OWNER. 
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE ON 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE GAME 
ITSELF AND THE PLAYERS THAT ARE 
PLAYING IT AND THE COACHES THAT 
ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS. 
SO MARK HAS BEEN RIGHT ON THE 
FRINGES THIS ENTIRE FINALS 
SERIES. 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 
CONTROVERSIAL CALLS.
THAT FITS RIGHT IN WITH SOME OF 
MARK'S THEORIES ABOUT HOW THE 
LEAGUE OPERATES.
ALL THAT SAID, I DON'T HAVE ANY 
PROBLEM WITH THE FINE OR THE 
PUNISHMENT, CONSIDERING 
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED, I 
WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY 
JUSTIFIED.
>> I WONDER, EARLIER TODAY ON 
"THE HOT LIST" WE WERE 
DISCUSSING THIS VERY THING THAT 
PERHAPS THIS IN A WAY HELPS THE 
MAVS AND CERTAINLY TAKES SOME 
OF THE PRESSURE OF THE 
SPOTLIGHT OFF THE TEAM ITSELF.
WADO YOU THINK? 
>> NOT AT ALL.
THE PLAYERS HAVE LEARNED TO 
TUNE MARK OUT AND TO LET MARK 
HAVE HIS BATTLES, AND YOU HEAR 
SOME DISPARAGING THINGS ABOUT 
"WE JUST KIND OF LET HIM GO ON 
AND WE TRY TO MAINTAIN OUR 
FOCUS," BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS 
BY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE 
REFEREES, BY SUGGESTING THAT 
THERE IS UNFAIR TREATMENT, BY 
SUGGESTING THAT THE LEAGUE HAS 
ULTERIOR MOTIVES FOR SOME OF 
THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED, 
THAT ACTUALLY CREATES AN EXCUSE 
FOR YOUR TEAM, AND YOU DON'T 
EVER WANT TO CREATE THAT 
SITUATION.
YOU ULTIMATELY WANT YOUR TEAM 
TO GO OUT THERE BELIEVING NO 
MATTER WHO IS OFFICIATING THE 
GAME, NO MATTER WHAT THE 
SITUATION IS, WE ARE THE BETTER 
TEAM AND WE ARE GOING TO 
DEMONSTRATE THAT AND WE ARE 
GOING TO DO WHATEVER IS 
NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT.
THE REALITY IS, WHILE THERE 
HAVE BEEN SOME CONTROVERSIAL 
CALLS, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 
DISPUTED CALLS, IN THIS LAST 
GAME, THE DALLAS MAVERICKS WENT 
WITH 21-25 AT THE FREE-THROW 
LINE. 
THE FOUR THAT THEY MISSED WAS 
ONE AT THE END OF REGULATION, 
AND THREE IN OVERTIME.
THEY'VE MADE A NUMBER OF MENTAL 
ERRORS. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY 
HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CONTROL THEIR DESTINY AND TO 
ACTUALLY CLOSE OUT THIS SERIES 
AT THIS POINT.
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DOWN 3-2 
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THE 
OFFICIATING HAS DONE, AND CUBAN 
POINTING THAT OUT DOES THEM NO 
FAVORS. 
>> AND CERTAINLY SUGGESTS, 
DOESN'T IT, MISSED FREE THROWS 
LATE THAT PERHAPS THEY'RE 
FEELING THE PRESSURE. 
AS THESE MAVERICKS GO, AS DIRK 
NOWITZKI GOES GO THE MAVERICKS. 
>> HE BETTER HOPE NOT.
>> HE WAS FINED $5,000 FOR 
KICKING A BALL INTO THE STANDS 
FOLLOWING THAT GAME-FIVE LOSS.
I WONDER, RIGHT NOW, WHERE IS 
DIRK'S HEAD?
>> WELL, I'M WONDERING WHERE 
THE STATIONARY BIKE'S HEAD IS, 
BECAUSE HE KICKED A BASKETBALL 
AND HE KICKED A STATIONARY BIKE 
AND HE KICKED A TREE OF LIGHTS 
AND HE GETS $5,000 JUST FOR THE 
BASKETBALL. 
THAT SHOULD BE $15,000 BY MY 
COUNT.
I'M JOKING. 
I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE MONEY 
OUT OF DIRK'S POCKET. 
I JUST WISH -- I HAVE A LITTLE 
PROBLEM WITH A GUY WHO IS AS 
PASSIVE AS DIRK HAS BEEN DURING 
THE GAME, THEN GOING BALLISTIC 
AFTERWARDS. 
IF YOU HAVE PLAYED AN EMOTIONAL 
GAME AND YOU HAVE PUT 
EVERYTHING YOU CAN OUT ON THE 
FLOOR, AND THEN YOU'RE 
FRUSTRATED AT THE END AND YOU 
LET GO, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. 
I WANT TO SEE THE DIRK NOWITZKI 
THAT WE SAW AT VARIOUS TIMES 
DURING THE SERIES AGAINST SAN 
ANTONIO WHERE IT DIDN'T MATTER 
HOW THEY DEFENDED HIM, IT 
DIDN'T MATTER HOW THEY WENT AT 
HIM, HE WAS GOING TO BE 
AGGRESSIVE AND GET SOMETHING 
DONE. 
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ON A 
CONSISTENT BASIS IN THIS 
SERIES. 
>> WE'LL SEE IF WE SEE IT 
TONIGHT IN GAME SIX.
UNFORTUNATELY, RIC, WE'RE OUT 
OF TIME.
WE APPRECIATE YOU STOPPING BY.
>> COMING UP, TONIGHT, 7:30 
EASTERN RIGHT HERE.
. 
>> WE HAVE MUCH MORE COMING UP 
TO DISCUSS ABOUT GAME SIX.
.
Let's see, we got Vonage
a couple of months ago.
It was easy to install.
I mean, I'm not really tec
POSEY AGAIN COMES UP WITH IT AND
A LOOSE-BALL FOUL AGAINST THE
MAVERICKS.
>> Hubie: THAT WAS A VERY HEADY
PASS BY HOWARD.
ONCE HE WENT DOWN INTO THAT
BEHIND THE BACKBOARD AREA, THERE
WAS NO CHANCE FOR A SHOT.
BY THROWING IT OUT TO DIRK, I
THINK HE MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT HIM
BY SURPRISE.
NOW, THIS IS THE AFTERMATH OF
THE MISSED SHOT.
YOU CAN SEE PILING ON, THEY CAN
GET THE FIRST ONE.
EITHER ONE YOU HAD IT GOING.
TWO FOULS WERE COMMITTED.
>> Mike: HOWARD WITH HIS SECOND
FOUL, AND POSEY, WHO AS JUST
EN TERRIFIC THE LAST COUPLE OF
GAMES, HE'LL GO TO THE
FREE-THROW LINE.
POSEY, LAST YEAR, AS WE SAID
PLAYED WITH MEMPHIS.
WHEN HE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE
FIVE-TEAM, 13-PLAYER DEAL, HIS
REACTION WAS, WOW.
HE HAD A CHANCE HE KNEW TO PLAY
ON A SPECIAL TEAM, HAD A CHANCE
TO REALLY WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP.
AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, HUBIE,
HE WAS SO FRUSTRATED LAST YEAR,
HE MADE GREAT IMPROVEMENT, BUT
HE WAS HURT ALMOST THE ENTIRE
SEASON.
NOW HE'S HEALTHY.
STARTED MOST OF THE SEASON, BUT
THEN GOT HURT.
ANTOINE WALKER REPLACED HIM IN
THE STARTING LINE-UP, BUT HE'S
CONTENT WITH COMING OFF THE
BENCH.
>> Hubie: HE CAN DEFEND ALL
THREE POSITIONS, SMALL FORWARD,
POWER FORWARD, OR A TWO-GUARD.
>> Mike: O'NEAL WITH THE
DEFLECTION.
>> Hubie: GREAT HANDS BY SHAQ.
>> Mike: WADE ON THE DRIVE TO
THE BASKET AND A HARD FOUL.
>> Hubie: HE GOT HIT FIRST
BEFORE THE SECOND HIT.
HE WAS HIT AS HE WAS GOING IN
FOR THE SHOT.
THEN HE GOT HIT AGAIN.
KEEP AN EYE ON THIS.
YOU SEE IT RIGHT THERE.
AND THEN RIGHT THERE.
HE GOT IT BY BOTH GUYS.
>> Mike: THE FOUL IS ON
NOWITZKI.
THAT'S CERTAINLY NOTHING EXTRA
THERE.
THAT'S JUST HARD FOULS WHEN YOU
GO TO THE BASKET AND PLAYERS GET
A LITTLE TANGLED UP.
>> Hubie: WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS
YOUR BIG MAN, WHO'S COMING
ACROSS, THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM
TO STOP.
AND EASE GOING FOR THE SHOT
CLOCK.
THAT WAS THE SECOND COLLISION.
>> Mike: MARQUIS DANIELS
RETURNS.
AGAIN, NO JERRY STACKHOUSE FOR
DALLAS, SUSPEND THE ONE GAME.
NOWITZKI WITH HIS THIRD FOUL
WILL SIT.
YOU SEE THE LAKERS, SHAQUILLE
O'NEAL, LOWEST OF ALL TIME.
9-18 HERE IN THIS QUARTER.
MISSED 9 FREE THROWS IN THE
QUARTER.
>> Hubie: MIAMI IN A ZONE RIGHT
NOW, TWO-THREE ZONE MATCHING UP.
THIS IS A SMART.
THEY'RE GOING TO STOP ALL OF
THIS HIGH PICK-AND-ROLL STUFF.
>> Mike: HOWARD.
GETS AWAY.
NICE BALL FAKE.
HOWARD REALLY HAS IT GOING
NICELY.
>> Hubie: IT WAS A POOR
DEFENSIVE MOVE BY WADE.
HE WENT OUT AND LEFT HIS FEET.
JOSH HOWARD IS EXCELLENT IN
GIVING YOU THE BALL FAKE AND
STEPPING INSIDE AND GETTING
HIMSELF IN THAT COMFORT ZONE.
>> Mike: HE'S GOT 23 POINTS AND
8 REBOUNDS.
GOOD ENTRY PASS TO O'NEAL!
PERFECT ANGLE.
AND THE BIG GUY TAKES CONTROL.
IT'S BACK TO A FOUR-POINT LEAD.
>> Hubie: LOOK OUT FOR THE EIGHT
SECONDS HERE.
>> Mike: AND THEY JUST GET IT
OVER WITH A SECOND TO SPARE.
>> Hubie: INDEED.
>> Mike: HAVE TO GET THE BALL
ACROSS THE HALFCOURT MK IN
EIGHT SECONDS.
DANIELS, WADE SHUTS HIM OFF
NICELY.
TOUGH SHOT WITH A HAND IF HIS
FACE.
>> Hubie: HE'S A PLAYER THAT CAN
MAKE THOSE KIND OF SHOTS.
HE'S AN OFF-BALANCE TYPE OF A
GUY, AND HE'S VERY, VERY GOOD
OFF THE DRIBBLE.
>> Mike: HADN'T SCORED A POINT
IN THE FIRST FOUR GAMES.
HE HAS TWO TOUGH SHOTS IN THIS
GAME, PLAYING FOR JERRY
STACKHOUSE, AS WALKER, POSEY
KEEPS IT ALIVE.
O'NEAL.
LINE DRIVE.
>> Hubie: GET IT UP.
GET IT UP.
>> Mike: TERRY ON THE PULL-UP.
>> Hubie: NICE.
>> Mike: AND THE MAVS ANSWER
AGAIN TO GO UP EIGHT.
>> Hubie: YOU JUST CANNOT RELAX.
THEY PUT THE PRESSURE ON MIAMI.
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT MIAMI'S
DEFENSIVE TRANSITION GAME IS
WEAK.
SO YOU MUST CONTINUE TO PRESSURE
THEM INTO REACTION.
>> Mike: TERRY IS 9 FOR 13 FROM
THE FIELD.
WALKER POSTING UP HOWARD.
GOOD STRONG MOVE FROM WALKER.
>> Hubie: NOW, THAT WAS A
PRIMETIME MOVE BY A 20-POINT
SCORER.
YOU CAN SEE HE USED HIS BODY ALL
THE WAY.
HE JUST PUT HIS SOLDIER WHY
RIGHT INTO THAT DEFENDER.
[ WHISTLE ]
>> Mike: TERRY.
AND A FOUL ON JASON WILLIAMS.
ONLY THE FIRST TEAM FOUL FOR THE
HEAT HERE IN THE THIRD.
AS THEY TRY TO CRAWL BACK INTO
IT.
JUST UNDER 2:30 REMAINING IN THE
THIRD.
JASON TERRY AND JOSH HOWARD HAVE
BEEN SUPERB FOR THE MAVERICKS,
23 FOR HOWARD, 21 FOR TERRY.
THEY LEAD BY SIX.G.
>> THIS SPECIAL PRESENTATION OF
THE NBA FINALS ON ABC, BROUGHT
TO YOU BY --
>> Mike: YOU JUST UNDER 2:30
REMAINING IN THE THIRD.
DALLAS LEADING BY SIX.
GETTING A HUGE GAME FROM JOSH
HOWARD.
HE WAS 1-8 IN GAME THREE.
HE'S GOT 23 POINTS.
HOWARD WAS THE LAST PLAYER
SELECTED BACK IN THE 2003 DRAFT
OUT OF WAKE FOREST.
HE WAS THE ACC PLAYER OF THE
YEAR, BUT HE STILL FELL TO
29th OVERALL.
GREAT NUMBERS TONIGHT.
THE MAVERICKS WERE SHOCKED HE
FELL.
IN FACT, PAT RILEY SAID HE WAS
THINKING ABOUT TRADING UP TO GET
HIM, AND HE HAS BECOME WHAT A
BARGAIN.
RILEY SAYS HE'S BECOMING A STAR.
TERRIFIC ALL-AROUND PLAYER,
HUBIE AND HE'S HAVING GREAT
GAME.
>> Hubie: THEY DO NOT RUN MANY
PLAYS FOR HIM.
HE DOES EVERYTHING OUT OF
TRANSITION AND MOVEMENT.
>> Mike: THE LEAD BACK UP TO
EIGHT.
>> Hubie: NOW, JASON TERRY IS 10
FOR 14 IN THIS GAME.
AND HE'S JUST DOING IT SO
EASILY.
ANYTIME THAT HE GETS ON THE
MOVE, HE'S UP AND IN, HIGH
PERCENTAGE-WISE.
>> Mike: WALKER DRIVES.
GRIFFIN, THE REBOUND.
>> Hubie: THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT
HOOP SHOTS.
MIAMI'S GOT TO TAKE GOOD
PERCENTAGE SHOTS AND THEN
DEFINITELY AT THE FOUL LINE.
THE FOUL LINE IS KILLING THEM
WITH 14.
>> Mike: YOU CALLED THAT ONE A
HOPE SHOT.
>> Hubie: YES, INDEED.
>> Mike: HERE'S TERRY AGAIN.
>> Hubie: THERE IT IS.
>> Mike: MOVING SCREEN CALLED ON
MBENGA.
>> Hubie: THERE'S NO NEED FOR
MBENGA TO DO THAT.
JUST STAY THERE BECAUSE JASON
TERRY IS BEHIND -- IS AHEAD OF
JASON WILLIAMS AND THERE'S NO
NEED TO MOVE.
ALL RIGHT?
EVERY TIME HE COMES OFF OF THAT
CURL THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE
GAME, HE'S BEEN WIDE OPEN AT THE
FOUL LINE EXTENDED AREA.
>> Mike: WILLIAMS SITS.
PAYTON IS IN.
VAN HORN REPLACES MBENGA.
SO VAN HORN WILL PLAY CENTER NOW
GUARDING ALONZO MOURNING.
>> Hubie: RIGHT NOW THEY'RE
SMALL.
DALLAS HAS GONE TO A SMALL UNIT
AND THEY'RE FORCING MOURNING TO
PLAY VAN HORN.
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING, AS
WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE, THEY
WOULD PLAY ZONE TO COUNTERACT
THAT.
>> Mike: WADE.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE
KNOCKED DOWN A FIELD GOAL.
AND IT BRINGS THE HEAT BACK
WITHIN SIX.
HE'S JUST 4-15 BUT WE'RE
APPROACHING DWYANE WADE TIME.
>> Hubie: THERE YOU GO.
JUST KEEP YOUR MOVEMENT, DALLAS,
KEEP YOUR BALL GOING FROM SIDE
TO SIDE.
YOU'RE GETTING GOOD PERCENTAGE
SHOTS.
ANYTIME THAT YOU GET GOOD
MOVEMENT.
>> Mike: DANIELS ON THE DRIVE.
ANOTHER TOUGH SHOT.
THIS ONE WON'T GO.
WADE LIKE NOWITZKI, THEY CAN
HAVE OFFSHOOTING NIGHTS BUT
STILL SCORE A LOT OF POINTS
BECAUSE THEY GET TO THE
FREE-THROW LINE SO OFTEN.
WADE, AGAIN.
>> Hubie: THAT'S BEEN MISSING.
THAT'S BEEN MISSING TONIGHT.
HE'S 15 -- HIS 15 TO 18-FOOT
GAME.
>> Mike: WE'RE BACK TO WITHIN
FOUR.
FINAL MINUTE, THIRD QUARTER.
THE DEFENSE HAS PICKED UP.
>> Hubie: THEY SURE DID.
THEY PLAYED VERY WELL THAT TIME
ON THE SCREEN.
[ WHISTLE ]
>> Mike: OFFENSIVE FOUL!
AS DANIELS AFTER THE PASS, WHO
ELSE BUT JAMES POSEY PICKS UP
YET ANOTHER CHARGE.
>> Hubie: AT BOTH ENDS WE'RE
SEEING PEOPLE SACRIFICING THEIR
BODIES, MAKING GOOD ROTATIONS,
TAKING THE CHARGE.
THAT'S THE OLD STORY OF BEING
FAMILIAR OF PLAYING GUYS WHEN
YOU'RE PLAYING THEM EVERY OTHER
DAY.
>> Mike: THAT'S HIS SEVENTH
CHARGE THAT HE'S DRAWN IN THE
PAST FOUR GAMES.
POSEY AN INVALUABLE DEFENDER AS
THE SERIES HAS SHIFTED HERE IN
MIAMI.
HE'S ONE OF THOSE WEIRD PEOPLE
THAT LIKES TO PLAY DEFENSE,
HUBIE.
>> Hubie: FOR US HE WAS A
TERRIFIC DEFENDER IN MEMPHIS.
HE PLAYED THE OTHER TEAMS HIGH
SCORING, TWO GAFFORDS, SMALL
FORWARD.
HE REALLY GAVE OF HIMSELF NIGHT
IN AND NIGHT OUT.
>> Mike: AND HITS A THREE!
POSEY MAKES IT A ONE-POINT GAME.
>> Hubie: JAMES POSEY RIGHT NOW
HAS MADE SEVEN THREES IN THIS
SERIES.
>> Mike: TWO SECOND DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SHOT CLOCK AND GAME
CLOCK.
HARRIS TIED UP.
[ WHISTLE ]
>> Hubie: GOOD DOUBLE-TEAM ON
DIRK.
>> Mike: A FOUL CALLED.
PAYTON.
SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET HIT WITH
A TECHNICAL.
NOPE.
JOE CRAWFORD, IT LOOKED LIKE HE
WAS READY TO BLOW, HUBIE.
>> Hubie: THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
MOVE BY NOWITZKI.
HE MADE WHAT WE CALL A BACK
DOOR.
HE RAN WITHOUT THE BALL.
CAUGHT THE DEFENDERS LOOKING AT
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FLOOR.
NOW, BUT AS SOON AS HE MADE THAT
CATCH, TWO DEFENDERS, JUST WATCH
THIS.
WATCH THE TWO GUYS COME RIGHT TO
HIM.
ALL RIGHT.
EXCELLENT REACTION THERE BY
POSEY AND PAYTON.
>> Mike: THEY CALL THE FOUL ON
POSEY, HIS THIRD.
PUT THE HAND ON HIM.
>> Hubie: PUT THE HAND.
YEAH.
>> Mike: NOT IN THE PENALTY.
SO THEY'LL INBOUND AND HOLD IT
FOR THE FINAL SHOT OF THE
PERIOD.
DEVIN HARRIS, NOPE, TAKES A
QUICK SHOT.
NOT A SMART ONE AT ALL.
>> Hubie: NO.
>> Mike: POSEY.
WADE TAKES EVERY, AT THE BUZZER!
NEARLY BANKS IT IN.
AND THAT WILL END THE THIRD
PERIOD.
HARRIS WITH A BAD DECISION SHOT
IT EARLY AND WADE NEARLY HAD THE
MAVERICKS MAY.
-- PAY.
ALL-IMPORTANT GAME FIVE, A
ONE-POINT GAME AS WE HEAD TO THE
FOURTH.
THIS PRESENTATION OF THE NBA
FINALS ON ABC CONTINUE AFTER
THIS MESSAGE AND A WORD FROM OUR
ABC STATIONS.
YOU WANT IT ALL
YOU WANT IT ALL 
ALL OR NOTHING 
WE OFFER MAJOR CARRIERS,
GREAT PLANS,
AND TOP-OF-THE-LINE PHONES,
WHICH, TOGETHER
WITH THE HELPFUL ADVICE
TO MAKE SURE YOU FIND
THE EXACT PHONE YOU NEED,
IS THE REASON WHY
OUR SALES ASSOCIATES
ARE RATED NUMBER ONE IN
WIRELESS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.
RADIO SHACK -- YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD WIRELESS STORE.
>> THESE NEXT TWO MINUTES WE GOT
TO GET THIS SCORE TIED.
THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT.
OKAY?
>> Mike: THAT WAS THE MESSAGE
WITH TWO MINUTES TO GO IN THE
THIRD QAERD.
AND THE -- QAERD.
AND THE HEAT DOWN NINE IN THE
PERIOD.
CAME STORMING BACK AND PULLED TO
WITHIN ONE AS WE GET SAID SET
FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER.
ALMOST TOOK THE LEAD BUT WADE'S
SHOT AT THE BUZZER MISFIRED.
AS THEY END WITH A SEVEN-0 RUN
HERE IN GAME FIVE OF THE NBA
FINALS.
HUBIE, WE HAVE TWO TEAMS THAT
HAVE NEVER PLAYED IN THE NBA
FINALS TIME FOR THEIR FIRST
CHAMPIONSHIP.
THE SERIES DEADLOCKED AT 2-2.
THE ALL-IMPORTANT GAME FIVE WITH
THE SERIES HEADING BACK TO
DALLAS AFTER TONIGHT.
MIAMI WANTS TO MAKE SURE THEY
DON'T PUT THEMSELVES IN A
POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE TO WIN
TWO ON THE ROAD TO WIN A
CHAMPIONSHIP.
AS YOU KNOW, THE LAST TWO GAMES,
THE FOURTH QUARTER HAS NOT BEEN
KIND TO THE MAVERICKS.
>> Hubie: IT MAY CHANGE FOR THE
MAVERICKS RIGHT NOW.
THEY NEED TO GET TO THE LINE.
IN THE THIRD QUARTER, ZERO FOUL
SHOT ATTEMPTS NOW, MIAMI NOT
OVERCOME BECAUSE OF THE FACT
THEY WERE 9 FOR 18 ON THE FOUL
LINE.
>> Mike: WADE LEFT HIS FEET.
IT'S A TURNOVER, NUMBER TEN FOR
MIAMI.
>> Hubie: DALLAS MUST CUT DOWN
ON THE TURNOVERS NOW.
DO NOT SETTLE FOR ALL JUMP
SHOTS.
>> Mike: HOWARD, THE HOT HAND.
THAT'S A TWO-POINTER.
NOT EVEN CLOSE, O'NEAL THE
REBOUND.
IN GAME THREE, THE HEAT OVERCAME
A 13-POINT DEFICIT IN THE FOURTH
TO WIN.
IN GAME FOUR, THEY HELD THE
MAVERICKS TO SEVEN POINTS,
LOWEST EVER IN A FINALS QUARTER.
WADE PUTS IT IN!
AND THE MIAMI HEAT HAVE REGAINED
THE LEAD.
THEIR FIRST LEAD OF THE SECOND
HALF.
>> Hubie: NOW, THIS GAME FOUR,
THE GAME PLAN FOR DALLAS WAS TO
GIVE DWYANE WADE THE OUTSIDE
SHOT.
TAKE AWAY THE DRIVE TO THE
BASKET.
WHAT YOU SAW TONIGHT, THEY TOOK
AWAY THE DRIVE.
THEY MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM.
BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THE JUMP
SHOTS ARE OPENING.
>> Mike: HARRIS, GOOD DRIVE.
AND HE'S GOT HIT.
SO DEVIN HARRIS, WHO IS NOT
AFRAID TO GO UP AGAINST THE BIG
GUY WILL SHOOT TWO.
>> Hubie: I'M HAPPY FOR THE
YOUNG MAN BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO
GET TO THE FOUL LINE.
HE'S 1 FOR 7 IN THE GAME.
THE OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN
THERE FOR HIM.
HE'S BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE THE
BASKETBALL.
HE'S MESSED A COUPLE WHERE HE
WAS SLIGHTLY BUMPED WHERE YOU
WANT THE CALL.
BUT IN THIS GAME ON THE DRIVE,
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE CALL.
>> Mike: YOU SEE THE FREE
THROWS, THE HEAT COULD HAVE A
COMFORTABLE LEAD IF THEY'D KNOCK
DOWN SOME MORE, AS HARRIS TIES
THE GAME.
DEVIN HARRIS, THE SECOND-YEAR
GUARD FROM DOWNTOWN MILWAUKEE,
PLAYED COLLEGE BALL AT
WISCONSIN, HAS REALLY STARTING
TO COME ON MAKING NAME FOR
HIMSELF IN THESE PLAYOFFS.
>> Hubie: AS YOU MOVE THROUGH
THIS GAME, MIKE, AS YOU GET DEEP
IN THIS FOURTH QUARTER, THE
QUICKNESS FACTOR IS BIG.
BECAUSE HE CAN BEAT ANYONE OFF
THE DRIBBLE TO THE RIM.
>> Mike: THE MAVS REMAIN PERFECT
AT THE FRNLG LINE, 11 FOR 11.
O'NEAL.
POSEY, ANOTHER THREE.
WON'T GO.
AND NOWITZKI LET'S IT
GO OUT OF THE BOUNDS.
>> Hubie: EARLY IN THIS GAME
ANYTIME SHAQ CAUGHT THE BALL,
THEY WERE WAITING FOR DRIBBLE.
NOW, CAN YOU SEE THEY'RE COMING
MUCH EARLIER AND SHAQ'S TAKING
HIS TIME TO FIND THE FREE MAN.
MB HARES.
I --
>> Mike: HARRIS.
, GOOD REBOUND BY SHAQ.
>> Mike: PAYTON ON THE FLOOR, AS
HE IS OFTEN IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER PPT RIGHT BACK TO THE
BIG FELLA.
O'NEAL DUMPS IT IN.
>> Hubie: IF YOU PLAY HIM MAN TO
MAN, HE WILL JUST TAKE THAT JUMP
SHOT, THAT JUMP HOOK RIGHT UP
OVER THE TOP.
>> Mike: HE'S 7-10 FROM THE
FIELD.
HARRIS TO TERRY.
SHOT CLOCK AT SEVEN.
HARRIS OFF-BALANCE.
AND HE GOT BUMPED.
O'NEAL FORCED HIM OUT.
SECOND TEAM FOUL AND THIRD ON
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
>> Hubie: THIS YOUNG FELLA, HE
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW TILL
THE END OF THE GAME.
ANYTIME HE TAKES MORE THAN ONE
DRIBBLE, YOU KNOW THAT HE'S
GOING TO BE HARASSING THAT
DEFENDER.
BECAUSE THINGS WILL OPEN UP.
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO GET JASON
TERRY INVOLVED NOW.
>> Mike: AGAIN ON THE FIFTH FOUL
IN EACH QUARTER, WE GO TO THE
LINE IN THE PENALTY ON
NON-SHOOTING FOULS.
[ WHISTLE ]
AND A WHISTLE, CAN HARDLY HEAR
IT.
JOE CRAWFORD TALKING, DEFENSIVE
THREE-SECONDS WHICH IS A
TECHNICAL FOUL.
>> Hubie: ANYTIME THERE IS A
CLEAROUT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF
THE FLOOR, THEY WILL SEND THEIR
PEOPLE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF
THE LANE IN.
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING TO
HELP OUT.
>> Mike: NOWITZKI HITS.
THE NBA FINALS ON ABC CONTINUE
TUESDAY, GAME SIX WILL BE BACK
IN DALLAS.
WHO WILL HAVE THE LEAD THOUGH IN
THE SERIES?
COVERAGE STARTS AT 8:30.
TIPOFF SHORTLY AFTER 9:00.
AND GAME SEVEN IF NECESSARY
THURSDAY BACK IN DALLAS.
BOTH GAMES IN TEXAS.
SO IMPORTANT FOR MIAMI TO GET
THE VICTORY HERE TONIGHT.
IT'S ALL EVEN WITH JUST OWN
EOVER NINE MINUTE RES MAINING.
[ WHISTLE ]
AND A TRAVEL CALLED ON TERRY.
>> Hubie: HE CAN TAKE PAYTON AND
HE CAN TAKE JASON WILLIAMS
ANYTIME OFF THE DRIBBLE.
MANY TIMES HE DOESN'T EVEN NEED
A SCREEN.
JUST GET HIM THE BASKETBALL, AND
HE CAN OPERATE.
>> Mike: MIAMI HEAT, 10-1 ON
THEIR HOME FLOOR IN THE
POSTSEASON.
WADE TRYING TO DRAW A FOUL.
TOUGH SHOT.
>> Hubie: YOU GOT TO LOOK UP
HERE NOW BECAUSE WADE IS WAY
BEHIND EVERYONE.
>> Mike: TERRY, QUICK SHOT, TOO
QUICK.
THE AIRBALL REBOUNDED BY HOWARD.
AND THEY'LL SET IT UP.
STILL WITH TIME, TEN ON THE SHOT
CLOCK.
HARRIS WITH THE UMP?
ER.
-- JUMPER.
REBOUND, ONCE AGAIN, BY JOSH
HOWARD.
A BIG PLAY.
>> Hubie: THEY'RE DOING A
TERRIFIC JOB.
>> Mike: TERRY HITS THE THREE!
JASON TERRY FROM DOWNTOWN.
AND DALLAS BACK UP BY THREE.
>> Hubie: THAT WAS A JUST ALL
HUSTLE.
HUSTLE AND TOUGH, NOT WEIGHING
WORRYING ABOUT BODY CONTACT ON
THE OFFENSIVE REBOUND.
>> Mike: JOSH HOWARD'S TENTH
BOARD LEADS TO THE
THREE-POINTER.
POSEY RIGHT BACK TO O'NEAL.
PAYTON.
POSEY, A CONTESTED SHOT.
WON'T GO.
[ WHISTLE ]
AND JOSH JUST HAMMERS O'NEAL ON
THE REBOUND.
THAT'S FIVE FOULS ON SAGANA
DIOP.
JOSH HOWARD PAK MAKING BIG
PLAYS.
>> Hubie: HE JUST CAME IN FROM
THE CORNER ON THAT ONE RIGHT
THERE.
THAT BEAUTIFUL EXTENSION.
HE'S HAVING A TERRIFIC NIGHT,
AND THEN THE KICK-OUT AND TERRY
STANDING BY HIMSELF, IT'S BEEN
AUTOMATIC TONIGHT.
>> MY FATHER WAS A GREAT MAN,
GREAT FAMILY MAN, STRONG, STRONG
BREADWINNER FOR THE FAMILY.
REALLY LEARNED A LOT OF MY
TOUGHNESS FROM HIM AND, YOU
KNOW, JUST KNOWING TO YOU HOW TO
GIVE TOUGH-AND HOW TO PLAY THE
GAME.
I WAS A BASEBALL PLAYER AND A
BASKETBALL PLAYER GROWING UP,
AND HE TRIED TO COME TO ALL OF
MY GAMES.
AND HE JUST ALWAYS JUAN
IMMEDIATE TO PLAY HARD, PLAY
HARD, PLAY HARD, PLAY A TOUGH.
HE WAS A GREAT MAN, JIM JOHNSON.
>> Mike: HIS FATHER PASSED AWAY
BACK IN 1992 BUT NOT BEFORE
PASSING ON PART OF HIS
TOUGHNESS.
AND AVERY JOHNSON HAS PASSED
THAT ON TO HIS TEAM.
THEY HAVE SHOWN TOUGHNESS,
INCLUDING ON THE ROAD, HUBIE.
THEY CLINCHED ALL THREE OF THEIR
CEASIES ON THE ROAD INCLUDING
GAME SEVEN IN OVERTIME IN
SAN ANTONIO.
AND THE -- IN THE CONFERENCE
SEMIFINALS AND THEY'RE SHOWING
THEIR TOUGHNESS AGAIN HERE
TONIGHT.
>> Hubie: THEY SET THAT DURING
THE SEASON.
THEY HAVE THE THIRD BEST ROAD
RECORD IN THE LEAGUE.
>> Mike: O'NEAL WANTS THE BALL.
[ WHISTLE ]
HASLEM DIDN'T GET IT TO HIM, BUT
BEFORE THE SHOT, DAMPIER WAS
SHOVING O'NEAL OUT OF THE WAY.
THAT'S FIVE FOULS ON DAMPIER.
>> Hubie: THAT WAS BY DESIGN.
THEY POSTED SHAQ RIGHT ABOVE THE
CIRCLE OF THE DEFENSIVE CIRCLE
IN THE LANE.
AND THEN DAMPIER TRIED TO FRONT
SHAQ, AND HE JUST OUTMUSCLED HIM
WITH HIS FOREARM.
EASY CALL FOR BENNETT SAL HAVE
FOR.
-- SALVATORE.
>> Mike: WADE.
HARRIS DOESN'T GO FOR.
WADE CAN'T HIT.
>> Hubie: ONE OF THE VERY FEW HE
MISSED.
>> Mike: WADE HAD THAT
INCREDIBLE FOURTH QUARTER IN
GAME THREE.
THEY CAME BRACK FROM 13 DOWN
WITH 6:30 TO GO.
>> Hubie: IT'S TAKING TOO LONG
TO DEVELOP.
>> Mike: SHAQ OUT ON NOWITZKI.
NOWITZKI KICKS IT OUT.
AND A 24-SECOND VIOLATION.
>> Hubie: THERE WAS SO MUCH
CONGESTION IN THE PAINTED AREA
AND DOWN ON THE BASELINE.
JUST WATCH OVER HERE ON THE
RIGHT.
WHO IS ON DIRK?
THE SHAQ MAN.
NOW, YOU CAN SEE THE DEFENDERS,
THREE GUYS CAME TO NOWITZKI THAT
TIME.
>> Mike: ONE OF THE LARGEST
PERIMETER DEFENDERS WE'VE EVER
SEEN.
>> Hubie: WE SAW THAT IN GAME
FOUR.
HE WAS GUARDING PEOPLE OUT ON
THE CORNER.
>> Mike: TRYING TO USE EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
SIX NOULS AND YOU'RE OUT.
NEAL HARASSED.
EXCELLENT DEFENSE.
LAST TOUCHED BY WADE.
TERRIFIC DOUBLE-TEAM AND THEY
FORCED A TURNOVER.
>> Hubie: WHEN YOU PASS OUT OF
THE POST, SHAQ CAN'T BE THAT
TIMID.
THAT WAS A VERY SOFT PASS.
AND ONCE AGAIN, DEVIN HARRIS
WITH HIS QUICKNESS.
HIS QUICKNESS GOT RIGHT IN THERE
AND CAUSED THAT DEFLECTION.
>> Mike: BALL DENIAL IS A LOST
ART.
AND DEVIN HARRIS IS ADEPT.
NOWITZKI DANKS THAT ONE IN.
>> Hubie: THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
CHANGE OF DIRECTION BY DIRK.
THE DEFENDER NOT HAVE PLAYED HIM
ANY BETTER.
DENIED THE PASS AND THEN A HEAVY
MOVE, A SPIN MOVE CAUSED THAT
NICE LOB PASS IN THE BANK SHOT.
>> Mike: MAVERICKS BACK UP BY
FIVE.
NOWITZKI HAS 15.
WADE PUMPS AS HE WENT TO THE
BASKET.
HARRIS FOUL HIM, THEY'RE GOING
TO SAY IN THE ACT OF SHOOTING,
SO HE'LL SHOOT TWO.
>> Hubie: KEEP AN EYE ON DIRK.
HE GOT BUMPED A NUMBER OF TIMES.
WATCH HIM CHANGE DIRECTION RIGHT
HERE.
HASLEM DID A TERRIFIC JOB.
AND NOT ONLY -- REMEMBER WE TOLD
YOU ABOUT DIRK?
HE CAN MAKE THE CATCH AND
ELEVATE.
DISTANCE IS NEVER A FACTOR.
>> Mike: REMEMBER, THIS IS A
SEVEN-FOOTER MOVING WITH THE
BALL LIKE THAT.
>> Hubie: THAT'S RIGHT.
DURING SEASON HE HAD LESS THAN
TWO TURNOVER GAMES.
WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOUR HE HATHS
THE BASKETBALL, THAT'S
STAGGERING.
>> Mike: WADE HITS ANOTHER FREE
THROW.
WADE WHO'S 6-20 FROM THE FIELD
HAS 25 POINTS.
THERE'S NOWITZKI'S NUMBERS.
AND, AGAIN, THE MIAMI DEFENSE
DOUBLE-TEAMING NOWITZKI, TRYING
TO TAKE THE BALL OUT OF HIS
HANDS.
THAT'S WHY JASON TERRY AND JOSH
HOWARD HAVE BNT ABLE TO --
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ERUPT.
APPROACHING THE MIDWAY POINT OF
THE FOURTH.
IT'S A THREE-POINT LEAD.
FOUL ON GARY PAYTON.
THIRD TEAM FOUL.
AND PAYTON WITH TWO.
AVERY JOHNSON AND PAT RILEY,
THEY BOTH WON CHAMPIONSHIP
RINGS.
RILEY IS A COACH AND PLAYER.
JOHNSON IS PLAYER WITH
SAN ANTONIO.
THE ONLY PLAYER TO HAVE ONE ON
THESE TWO TEAMS IS O'NEAL.
AND O'NEAL GRAB THE REBOUND.
HE'S LOOKING FOR HIS FOURTH
RING.
WADE ON THE DRIVE.
DANGEROUS PASS.
WADE.
[ WHISTLE ]
DRAWS THE FOUL.
AND THEY'LL GO BACK TO THE LINE.
WE'LL HAVE A TIME-OUT AS JOSH
HOWARD PICKS UP HIS THIRD.
A CLOSE BATTLE HERE IN THE
FOURTH.
DWYANE WADE, WHO'S SHOWN SOME
MATCH EK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
IN THIS POSTSEASON WITH A CHANCE
TO BRING HIS TEAM WITHIN ONE.
>>IRKS
>> THANK YOU FOR WATCHING ABC
SPORTS.
>> OH, BABY.
>> HOME OF THE NBA FINALS.
>> THIS SPECIAL PRESENTATION OF
THE NBA FINALS ON ABC, BROUGHT
TO YOU BY --
>> Mike: JUST PAST THE MIDWAY
POINT, FOURTH QUARTER OF GAME
FIVE.
DALLAS LEADING BY THREE.
DWYANE WADE WILL SHOOT TWO FREE
THROWS.
THE FUTURE OF THE NBA IS IN
TERRIFIC HANDS WITH BLAIRS LIKE
WADE.
SEE WHAT HE'S DONE ON THESE
FINALS.
FIRST TWO GAMES DIDN'T SHOOT THE
BALL WELL.
THEN HE HAD THAT EXPLOSIVE
THRILLING COMEBACK IN GAME
THREE.
ANOTHER SUPERB PERFORMANCE IN
GAME FOUR.
HE IS PUTTING UP SOME
UNBELIEVABLE NUMBERS IN HIS
FIRST TRIP ON THE NBA'S BIGGEST
STAGE.
>> Hubie: YOU CAN SEE RIGHT
THERE, HE'S STRUGGLING FROM THE
FIELD THIS EVENING.
THE FOUL SHOTS, HE'S MISSED 4,
HE'S 14-18.
WHEN DWYANE WADE GOES TO THE
LINE RIGHT NOW, MIAMI WILL BE
SHOOTING THEIR 39th AND 40th
40th FREE THROWS OF THIS GAME,
AND WE STILL HAVE 5:40 TO GO.
THEY'RE GETTING THE
OPPORTUNITIES BUT THEY'VE MISSED
14.
>> Mike: DWYANE WADE MAKES IT A
TWO-POINT GAME.
TWO PERFECT FREE THROWS THERE.
JASON TERRY HAS HAD THE HOT HAND
FOR DALLAS.
>> Hubie: RIGHT NOW THIS IS ALL
ABOUT MOVEMENT WITH DALLAS.
THEY MUST MOVE TO KEEP THEIR
DEFENSE GOING FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
>> Mike: HOWARD WITH POSEY ON
HAND.
TERRIFIC MATCH-UP.
DIOP.
NOWITZKI.
THAT'S A THREE.
WAY OFF.
>> Hubie: WITH DIOP IN THERE,
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY'RE NOT
LOOKING FOR ANY SHOTS.
EVEN DAMPIER.
THEY MAKE A CATCH AND IF THEY'RE
MORE THAN FIVE FEET AWAY FROM
THE BASKET, THEY JUST CAN'T
SCORE.
THEY NEED ANOTHER PASS.
>> Mike: O'NEAL, SINGLE
COVERAGE, QUICK SHOT.
WON'T GO.
NOWITZKI GOT HAMMERED AFTER
GRABBING THE REBOUND.
HASLEM WILL PICK UP HIS FIFTH.
AND THAT'S THE FOURTH TEAM FOUL
ON MIAMI.
>> Hubie: YEAH, YOU NEVER GET
UPSET WITH YOUR GUYS WHEN
THEY'RE BANGING THE OFFENSIVE
GLASS.
HASLEM WENT IN THERE LIKE A
WARRIOR.
DIRK HAD THE REBOUND.
AND THEN NATURALLY, THAT WAS AN
EASY CALL, BECAUSE HASLEM CAME
RIGHT UP OVER THE TOP.
>> Mike: HASLEM DOES NOT HAVE
BIG NUMBERS, BUT HIS DEFENSIVE
JOB ON NOWITZKI HAS BEEN
CRITICAL FOR MIAMI.
NOWITZKI HAVING ANOTHER ROUGH
SHOOTING GAME.
TERRY.
[ WHISTLE ]
AND PAYTON HIT HIM.
JASON TERRY BEATING HIM OFF THE
DRIBBLE WILL SHOOT TWO.
>> Hubie: JASON TERRY HAS BEEN
SO CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THIS
ENTIRE SERIES.
NOW, JUST WATCH THE QUICKNESS AS
HE BLOWS BY PAYTON.
SO GETS RIGHT TO WHERE HE WANTS
TO GO.
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FOUL
HIM.
HE'S 11 FOR 16 FROM THE FIELD.
HE'S GOT FOUR THREES AND NOW
HE'S GOING TO THE LINE.
>> Hubie: TERRY PLAYED HIS FIRST
FIVE YEARS WITH THE ATLANTA
HAWKS.
THEY DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO THE
PLAYOFFS BUT HE USED TO ATTEND
THE PLAYOFF GAMES INCLUDING THE
FINALS.
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN
AWE WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED
THERE.
HE COULD PICK UP SOME TIPS.
AND HE CERTAINLY HAS PLAYED WELL
IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE
FINALS.
>> Hubie: THE THING I LIKE ABOUT
HIM IS HE JUST DOESN'T FORCE THE
ACTION.
HE PLAYS WITHIN WHATEVER YOU'RE
RUNNING.
AND THEN JUST DOES THINGS -- YOU
KNOW, RIGHT THERE, THEY FOULED
SHAQ.
>> Mike: IT'S THE HACK-A-SHAQ.
>> Hubie: THIS IS INTERESTING
WITH 4:44 TO GO.
THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON
SHAQ.
HE'S ONLY 1 FOR 8 FROM THE FOUL
LINE THIS EVENING.
>> Mike: WE'VE SEEN THIS A
COUPLE OF TIMES WITH THE TEAM
AHEAD GOING TO THE HACK-A-SHAQ.
WE SAW IT IN THE DETROIT MIAMI
SERIES.
HE WAS THE -- O'NEAL JUST 1 FOR
8.
AGAIN, THIS IS AWAY FROM THE
PLAY.
THEY QUICKLY FOUL.
MANY CASES, THE PLAYERS WILL
ALERT THE OFFICIALS THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.
THAT'S HIS WIFE.
SHE CAN'T BEAR TO LOOK.
CAN YOU DO THIS UP UNTIL TWO
MINUTES REMAINING IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER.
THEN THE RULE CHANGES.
AND IT PENALIZES YOU FOR DOING
THAT.
BUT O'NEAL HITS 1-2.
AND HIS DAD APPRECIATIVE.
>> Hubie: RIGHT NOW AVERY
JOHNSON IS SAY, WE'LL TRADE YOU
TWO FOR ONE.
THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
YOU'RE THINKING OPTIMISTICALLY.
WHILE THAT PUTS THE PRESSURE ON
TO EXECUTE.
>> Mike: TERRY.
TIED UP.
WILD PASS.
SHOT CLOCK AT FOUR.
HOWARD.
CAN'T CONNECT.
NOWITZKI, THOUGH.
THE BALL JUST GRAZED THE RIM, SO
THE SHOT CLOCK RESET.
>> Hubie: THEY GO TO BREAK
THERE.
YOU SAW THE WHITE SHIRTS.
EVERYONE WAS MOVING TO GET OUT
ON THE BREAK.
NO ONE WAS BACK IN TO DOUBLE THE
REBOUND.
>> Mike: NOWITZKI WANT IT'S
BALL.
TERRY, OVER O'NEAL AND HE DROPS
IT IN!
JASON TERRY ONCE AGAIN, HE'S GOT
30!
AND THE MAVS BACK UP BY FOUR.
THE SECOND 30-POINT GAME OF THE
SERIES.
PAYTON LEFT OPEN.
NAILS THE THREE!
>> Hubie: NOW, IS THAT BIG.
THAT IS REALLY BIG.
WHEN YOU THINK THAT GARY PAYTON
HAS BEEN PLAYING IN THIS GAME,
HE'S ONLY HAD A FEW SHOT
OPPORTUNITIES AND HE KNOCKS IN A
THREE.
>> Mike: HE'S HIT A COUPLE OF
BIG SHOTS IN THIS SERIES.
TERRY AGAIN.
MAKES HIS MOVE.
[ WHISTLE ]
DRAWS THE FOUL.
BANKS IT IN.
JASON TERRY, WHAT MARVELOUS
PERFORMANCE!
AND THE DALLAS MAVERICKS WITH A
CHANCE TO GO UP BY FOUR.
>> Hubie: HE'S PLAYING WITH SO
MUCH CONFIDENCE.
ANYTIME THAT HE KEEPS HIS
DRIBBLE, HE KNOWS THAT HE CAN
GET PAST HIS DEFENDER.
AND THEN FORCE THE DEFENSE TO
REACT.
NOW THE BIG FELLAS HAVE REALLY
COME IN THERE AND FORCED THAT
HIGH RELEASE.
LOOK AT THIS.
HERE'S THE SECOND ONE BACK TO
BACK.
NOW, THE DEFENDERS INSIDE HAVE
DONE A GOOD JOB.
OUT ON THE PERIMETER, NEGATIVE.
TERRY IS GETTING TO WHEREVER HE
WANTS TO GO.
>> Mike: HIS SECOND 32-POINT
GAME.
THAT'S WHAT HE HAD IN GAME ONE.
AND HE EXCEEDS THAT AND GIVES
THE DALLAS MAVERICKS A
FOUR-POINT LEAD WITH JUST UNDER
3:30 TO PLAY.
PAYTON, BY THE WAY, THAT WAS HIS
FOURTH FOUL.
HOWARD ON PAYTON.
THEY DOUBLE WADE.
[ WHISTLE ]
AND A BUMP.
OVERAGGRESSIVE IS JOSH HOWARD.
THAT'S HIS FOURTH.
AND THE MAVERICKS IN THE
PENALTY.
SO WADE, WHO HAS ASSET MIAMI
HEAT PLAYOFF RECORD FOR
FREE-THROW ATTEMPTS IN A GAME
WILL ADD TO THAT NOW WITH 21 AND
22.
>> Hubie: WELL, THEY TELL IF YOU
YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD NIGHT
OFFENSIVELY THAT YOU SHOULD GO
TO THE BASKET.
OKAY?
IT SOUNDS BASIC, BUT IF YOU GO
TO THE BASKET, GOOD THINGS
HAPPEN.
AND IF YOU GET AS MANY CATCHES
AS WADE DO, THEN YOU'RE GONNA
GET AN AWFUL LOT OF
OPPORTUNITIES OFF THE DRIVE.
YOU GET FOULED AND YOU GO TO THE
LINE.
>> Mike: HE HAS REALLY STRUGGLED
FROM THE FIELD, BUT YOU SEE THE
FREE-THROW SHOOTING.
CALMLY KNOCKS DOWN BOTH.
AND A TIME-OUT CALLED BY AVERY
JOHNSON.
WITH JUST OVER 3:00 REMAINING.
HERE IN THIS FOURTH QUARTER OF
GAME FIVE, SERIES TIED AT 2-2.
WHO WILL BE THE HERO?
JASON TERRY GOING RIGHT AT THE
BIG FELLA.
HE'S GOT 33.
THE MAVS BY TWO.
>> THIS IS IT.
IT'S ALL ON THE LINE.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU CAN GET
HERE AGAIN.
YOU WRECK ME BABY
YEAH, YOU RIP ME IN TWO 
BUT YOU KNOW ME HONEY 
YES YOU DO 
>> Mike: 3:08 REMAINING HERE IN
THIS GAME FIVE OF THE NBA FINALS
FROM MIAMI.
AND THE DALLAS MAVERICKS LEADING
BY TWO HOPING TO GO BACK TO
TEXAS WITH A 3-2 LEAD.
MEANWHILE, THIS THE FINAL HOME
GAME FOR THE MIAMI HEAT.
THEIR FANS HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS
THROUGHOUT THESE PLAYOFFS AND
OTHER CAPACITY TROUD CROWD.
SEE SOME OF THE FOUL
DIFFICULTIES.
THEY'VE GOT PLENTY TO GIVE.
JOSH HOWARD WITH FOUR.
NOW THE QUESTION, DOES DALLAS
CONTINUE WITH A HACK-A-SHAQ AND
MIAMI GETS THE BALL BACK?
YOU SEE HASLEM AND PAYTON, THE
ONLY ONE WITH SOME FOUL
QUESTIONS.
O'NEAL HAS STRUGGLED FROM THE
LINE.
IT IS SO HARD TO WIN THE MIDDLE
THREE GAMES SINCE THE NBA WENT
TO THIS FORMAT BACK IN '85.
ONLY ONE TEAM HAS WON THE MIDDLE
THREE GAMES.
THAT WAS DETROIT BACK IN 2004.
TERRY, AN OPEN THREE.
POSEY, GOOD BOXING OUT.
AND HASLEM HANDS IT OFF TO
PAYTON.
>> Hubie: THAT WAS AN
INTERESTING PLAY THAT THEY CAME
OUT OF A TIME-OUT.
NOW, THEY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED.
A WIDE-OPEN SHOT BY TERRY.
THEIR HOT MAN.
NOW WE HAVE THE HACK-A-SHAQ
RIGHT AWAY BY DIOP ON SHAQ.
>> Mike: THAT'S THEIR SIXTH FOUL
ON DIOP.
HE'S OUT.
BUT AGAIN, THEY HAVE DAMPIER AND
MBENGA TO COME IN WITH 2:44
REMAINING.
THERE'S THE FOUL AGAIN.
THE RULE WILL CHANGE WHEN YOU
GET TO THE TWO-MINUTE MARK.
THEN IT BECOMES ONE SHOT AND YOU
GET THE BALL BACK.
SO THEY CAN DO IT FOR 44 MORE
SECONDS.
AVERY JOHNSON NOT LOOKING HAPPY
THERE.
AND O'NEAL, 2-10 SO FAR TONIGHT.
SO FAR IT'S WORKED.
HE'S MISSED 2-3.
>> Hubie: NOW, THEY'RE PLAYING
THE PERCENTAGES AND THEY'RE
DOING A -- DOING A GOOD JOB.
TONIGHT, THIS IS A 2 FOR 11
RIGHT HIRE.
-- HERE.
>> Mike: MISSES BOTH BUT HASLEM,
THE OFFENSIVE REBOUND!
[ WHISTLE ]
>> Hubie: YEAH.
>> Mike: YEP, THEY'RE GOING TO
CALL A LANE VIOLATION?
OR IS IT A FOUL?
IT'S A LANE VIOLATION CALLED BY
JOEY CRAWFORD.
THEY OBVIOUSLY CAME INTO THE
PAINT BEFORE O'NEAL RELEASED IT.
THAT ACTUALLY PENALIZES THE
HEAT, BECAUSE HASLEM WOULD HAVE
HAD THE OFFENSIVE BOARD.
WATCH NOWITZKI.
>> Hubie: KEEP AN EYE ON HASLEM
ALSO.
ABOUT RIGHT HERE, WITH THE PUSH
ON DAMPIER.
SEE, HE JUST PUSHED HIM IN THE
LOWER BACK AND THEN WAS ABLE
ALSO TO GET THE REBOUND.
>> Mike: SO NOW O'NEAL WILL GET
ANOTHER CHANCE.
CLOCK BACK TO 2:44.
AGAIN CAN'T GET IT TO FALL.
AND TERRY COMES IN TO HELP OUT.
FREE THROWS HAVE JUST KILLED THE
MIAMI HEAT.
29-46, 17 MISSES FROM THE LINE.
PAYTON STAYS WITH TERRY.
[ WHISTLE ]
HOWARD.
FOULED ON THE PASS.
DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY'RE IN THE PENALTY.
SO HOWARD WILL SHOOT TWO.
AS POSEY PICKS UP THE PERSONAL.
>> Hubie: AS THE GAME PROGRESSES
AND YOU GET INTO THE FOURTH
QUARTER, THE FACT THAT DALLAS
HAS FOUR GUYS OUT ON THE
PERIMETER WHO CAN REALLY HANDLE
THE BASKETBALL AND ONCE THEY
MAKE A DIAGONAL PASS LIKE THEY
MADE TWO THEY PUT ON THE FLOOR
THEY'RE GOING BY YOU.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS, CAN YOU
ROTATE OR DO YOU FOUL THEM?
AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR MIAMI,
THEY'VE BEEN FOULING THEM.
>> Mike: YOU SAW THAT NUMBER
THERE, PERFECT FROM THE LINE.
SO O'NEAL WILL BE TAKEN OUT, FOR
THE NEXT 25 SECONDS BECAUSE OF
THE HACK-A-SHAQ.
AGAIN, THE RULE CHANGES AT 22
SECONDS SO THEY CAN PUT HIM BACK
IN.
DALLAS WITH A FOUR-POINT LEAD.
BOTH TEAMS WITH MULTIPLE
TIME-OUTS REMAINING.
>> Hubie: RIGHT NOW MIAMI'S
SMALL.
ANTOINE WALKER IS THEIR BIGGEST
MAN.
>> Mike: WADE ON THE DRIVE.
[ WHISTLE ]
BANKS IT IN!
AND A FOUL!
DWYANE WADE DOES IT AGAIN.
>> Hubie: THAT'S HIS PET MOVE.
NOW, ALL NIGHT IN GAMES ONE,
TWO, THREE, AND FOUR, HE'S BEEN
BANKING THEM IN.
NOW, UP UNTIL THIS STRETCH, HE
HAS NOT HAD THE TOUCH.
NOW, HOW ABOUT THIS?
UNDER PRESSURE, HE'S ABLE TO
PLAY THE BOARD AND KNOCK IT IN.
>> Mike: AGAIN, HE'LL GO TO THE
LINE.
HE'S 18-22 FROM THE LINE.
NOW WITH 32 POINTS FOR WADE, 10
OF THEM HERE IN THIS FOURTH
QUARTER.
MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR MIAMI, HAS
A CHANCE TO BRING THEM TO WITHIN
ONE.
IF HE HITS THIS FREE THROW, HE
TIES THE NBA FINALS RECORD FOR
MOST FREE THROWS IN A GAME.
HE DID IT, TIED WITH BOB PETTIT
IN 1958.
>> Hubie: RIGHT NOW.
>> Rachel: AVERY JOHNSON IS
MAKING THE CALL.
THE DEFENSE CHASED THEM AWAY,
THOUGH.
CAN A GOOD JOB.
>> Mike: NOWITZKI WANTING THE
BALL.
NOWITZKI GUARDED BY HASLEM.
TERRY.
TERRY FALLING AWAY!
AIRBALL!
REBOUND FOUGHT FOR.
AND A LOOSE-BALL FOUL?
NO A 24-SECOND VIOLATION.
AS IT NEVER HIT THE RIM.
>> Hubie: WOW, THAT WAS MIAMI'S
FINEST DEFENSE IN THIS QUARTER.
THEY DEFENDED THE HIGH SCREEN ON
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.
AND THEN ON THE DRIVE, THEY DID
NOT ALLOW TERRY CREATE THE ANGLE
AND GET TO THE BASKET.
THEY FORCED A BAD PERCENTAGE
SHOT.
>> Mike: EXCELLENT DEFENSE FROM
THE MIAMI HEAT.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL STILL SITS.
20,000-PLUS, ALMOST EVERYONE ON
THEIR FEET.
THE ALL-IMPORTANT GAME FIVE AS
THESE TWO TEAMS LOOK FOR THEIR
FIRST NBA CHAMPIONSHIP.
WADE.
PUTS IT IN!
MIAMI LEADS!
>> Mike: 35 FOR DWYANE WADE.
>> Hubie: NOW, THIS IS JUST A
BEAUTIFUL MOVE.
NOW, WATCH AS HE RUNS THE SPIN
MOVE ON HARRIS.
SEE, HE GIVES THE FAKE AND HE
STEPS BACK.
CREATED THE DISTANCE BECAUSE HE
KNEW HE COULD SHOOT UP OVER THE
TOP OF DEVIN HARRIS.
>> Mike: DALLAS BALL WHEN WE
COME BACK.
THEY TRAIL BY ONE.
(children playing)
THIS TIME I'M
GONNA BE K.G.
ALRIGHT,
I'M D-WADE.
(kids in unison)
THREE, TWO, ONE...
(imitating buzzer)
ALL DAY, BABY,
ALL DAY.
ALRIGHT, HIKE!
ONE MISSISSIPPI,
TWO MISSISSIPPI!
YES!
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, BABY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S COMING
AND YOU STILL WON'T HIT IT.
BRING IT THEN.
UGH, WHY DON'T YOU
TRY IT UNDERHAND?

>> Mike: MIAMI BACK UP BY ONE
WITH 1:40 TO PLAY IN THE FOURTH.
DWYANE WADE HADS THE BIG SHOT.
BUT IT'S THE DEFENSIVE STOPS,
HUBIE.
>> Hubie: JUST WATCH TO THE
RIGHT OF THE SCREEN.
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU HAVE TWO GUYS ON DIRK.
NOW, ONCE HE BEATS HIS MAN, TWO
DEFENDERS FORCING THE AIRBALL.
NOW, RIGHT HERE, NOW, WATCH
THIS, THAT SPIN MOVE, SEE, THAT
SPIN MOVE CAUGHT HARRIS LEANING
BACK.
DWYANE WADE WITH 13 POINTS IN
THIS QUARTER.
>> Mike: HE HAD 15 IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER OF GAME THREE.
>> Hubie: THEY JUST MISSED DEVIN
HARRIS ON THE SCREEN.
HE JUST WENT RIGHT DOWN THE
LANE.
[ WHISTLE ]
>> Mike: NOWITZKI DRAWS THE
FOUL.
WHAT AN AGGRESSIVE MOVE FROM
NOWITZKI.
AND HE'LL GO TO THE FREE-THROW
LINE.
PAT RILEY NOT PLEASED WITH THE
CALL.
AS WALKER PICKS UP HIS FOURTH.
>> Hubie: JUST -- DALLAS CAME
OUT OF THIS AND THEY THIS TWO
CUTTERS WIDE OPEN.
DIRK GOES WIDE INSIDE HERE.
GOT HIT BY TWO GUYS.
YOU KNOW THAT WAS AN EASY CALL.
BUT THE DEFENSE DID A -- AN
ADEQUATE JOB.
DEVIN HARRIS WAS OPEN, AND
HOWARD MIGHT HAVE BEEN OPEN ON
CUTS TO THE BASKET.
>> Mike: THEY REMAIN PERFECT
FROM THE LINE, 18 FOR 18.
NOWITZKI IS A GREAT FREE-THROW
SHOOTER.
REMEMBER, THOUGH, HE MISSED A
CRITICAL FREE THROW AT THE END
OF GAME TEE.
HE'S ALSO HIT BIG FREE THROWS
EARLIER IN THE PLAYOFFS.
MISSES THAT ONE!
TIE GAME WITH 1:20 TO PLAY.
>> Hubie: NOW, MIAMI HAS TWO
TIME-OUTS.
DALLAS HAS ONE FULL TIME-OUT AND
A 20.
>> Mike: WADE PULLS UP.
BANG!
>> Hubie: OH.
>> Mike: DWYANE WADE AGAIN!
>> Hubie: OH, MY.
AND HE'S MAKING IT SO EASY,
MOVE, NOT IN A HURRY, READING
IT'S DEFENSE.
>> Mike: A MINUTE REMAINING.
NOWITZKI WITH HASLEM RIGHT UP ON
HIM.
NOWITZKI.
KNOCKS IT DOWN!
DIRK NOWITZKI COMES RIGHT BACK
TO TIE THE GAME.
>> Hubie: HASLEM COULD NOT HAVE
PLAYED HIM ANY BETTER.
>> Mike: AND A BIG SHOT FROM
NOWITZKI WHO'S BEEN STRUGGLING
SHOOTING THE BALL.
WADE, TRYING TO DRAW THE FOUL.
SHORT.
HOWARD TIPS IT AND DAMPIER HOLDS
ON.
O'NEAL TRYING TO SWAT IT AWAY.
>> Hubie: YOU HAVE ABOUT SEVEN
SECONDS ON THE SHOT CLOCK.
[ WHISTLE ]
>> Mike: AND THEY'LL CALL
TIME-OUT.
SEVEN-SECOND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
GAME CLOCK AND SHOT CLOCK.
AND THE MAVERICKS WITH A CHANCE
TO TAKE THE LEAD.
HUBIE, DWYANE WADE DOING IT
AGAIN, ANOTHER HUGE FOURTH
QUARTER.
>> Hubie: NOW, THIS IS JUST --
HE'S SO UNDER CONTROL HERE.
HE TAKES THE SCREEN.
WHEN DEVIN HARRIS WENT UNDER
THAT SCREEN THAT TIME, IT JUST
OPENED UP THE DISTANCE FOR HIM
TO GET OFF THE BIG SHOT.
NOW, DOWN AT THIS END, THIS
IS -- HASLEM IS RIGHT ON TOP OF
DIRK.
SEE, ONCE HE GOES UP, HE HAS THE
SIZE ADVANTAGE AND THE RELEASE
AS HE SETS IT BACK AT THE ANGLE.
NOW, AT THIS -- THIS IS A
DIFFICULT SHOT.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HARRIS IS
RIGHT ON HIM.
HE TRIES TO DRAW THE CONTACT,
BUT DEVIN HARRIS AVOIDED THE
CONTACT.
THE SHOT IS SHORT.
>> Mike: WADE, 15 POINTS IN THE
FOURTH QUARTER, 37 FOR THE GAME.
WE'VE SAID IT A COUPLE OF TIMES.
WE ARE WATCHING THE BLOSSOMING
OF A TRUE NBA STAR, A YOUNG MAN
JUST HIS THIRD YEAR IN THE
LEAGUE.
THIS IS WHAT HE LIVES FOR.
HE'S ALREADY HAD ONE DEFINING
MOMENT IN GAME THREE WITH HIS
GREAT COMEBACK, DOING IT AGAIN.
BUT YOU ALSO LIKE TO SEE
NOWITZKIITYT HITTING A BIG SHOT.
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH NIGHT BUT HE'S
IN THE AFRAID TO TAKE THAT SHOT.
>> Hubie: THE PRESSURE'S BEEN
GREAT AT BOTH EVENS AND THE BIG
GUYS ARE DELIVERING.
THAT'S WHAT YOU LIKE TO SEE.
COMING OUT OF THIS TIME-OUT, YOU
KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT PROBABLY
TERRY AND NOWITZKI ARE GOING TO
BE YOUR MAIN OPTIONS IN THIS
PLAY.
YOU ONLY HAVE 16 SECONDS.
NOW, IF THEY SHOOT AND SCORE,
YOU KNOW THAT MIAMI HAS TWO
TIME-OUTS.
OKAY?
SO MIAMI WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE
THE BALL.
MIAMI NO MATTER WHAT, A SHOT AND
A MISS OR A SHOT AND A SCORE,
HAS PLENTY OF TIME HERE, BECAUSE
THERE'LL BE MANY SECONDS LEFT.
YOU HAVE SEVEN SECONDS IF THEY
TOOK THE FULL 16 SECONDS.
>> Mike: AFTER TONIGHT, THE
SERIES WILL SHIFT BACK TO
DALLAS.
GAME SIX WILL BE TUESDAY NIGHT
AT THE AMERICANAIRLINES CENTER
IN DALLAS, TEXAS.
BUT WHO WILL HAVE THE LEAD?
DWYANE WADE'S TEAM TRYING TO WIN
THREE STRAIGHT ON THEIR HOME
FLOOR.
THE HOME TEAM HAS BEEN PERFECT
SO FAR IN THIS SERIES.
DALLAS WITH A CHANCE TO STEAL
ONE HERE ON THE ROAD.
>> Hubie: HERE WE HAVE TWO-MAN
GAME, TERRY AND NOWITZKI.
>> Mike: TERRY, HERE'S THE
DOUBLE, O'NEAL HELPING OUT.
SHOCK CLOCK DOWN IT FIVE.
>> Hubie: OH, THAT WAS A GOOD
BASKETBALL.
>> Mike: NOWITZKI INSIDE TO
DAMPIER!
>> Hubie: NOW, SHAQ, SHAQ TRIED
TO HELP.
SHAQ TRIED TO HELP ON NOWITZKI,
AND THAT WAS A TERRIFIC LOOK AND
DELIVERY OF A PASS BY DIRK
NOWITZKI.
>> Mike: AND DAMPIER WITH JUST
HIS SECOND BASKET OF THE GAME
GIVES THE MAVERICKS A TWO-POINT
LEAD BUT STILL PLENTY OF TIME
REMAINING.
>> Hubie: NOW, THAT WAS A
BEAUTIFULLY RUN PLAY.
THE DECOY.
WATCH TO THE LEFT OF YOUR
SCREEN, SEE NOWITZKI LOOKING?
BECAUSE HE SAW SHAQ COME RIGHT
OUT TO DOUBLE-TEAM HIM.
BEAUTIFUL RECOGNITION, AND A
GREAT PASS BY DIRK.
>> Mike: THE THIRD ASSIST OF THE
GAME FOR NOWITZKI WHO AGAIN
DIDN'T WANT TO FORCE IT.
AND SETS UP HIS TEAMMATE
BEAUTIFULLY.
>> Hubie: THEY CAME OUT OF THAT
TIME-OUT, MIKE.
THEY RAN ONE CONTINUITY WITH
TERRY AND NOWITZKI, AND THEN
THEY CAME RIGHT BACK WITH
DAMPIER COMING UP AND SETTING
ANOTHER SCREEN.
SO IT WAS WELL RUN BY DESIGN.
YOU TOOK AWAY THE FIRST OPTION
AND THE SECOND OPTION.
THEN THEY RAN THE DOWN SCREEN
FOR NOWITZKI AND THAT'S HOW THAT
ALL OPENED UP.
BEAUTIFUL PLAY, AND A TERRIFIC
CALL COMING OUT OF THE HUDDLE.
>> Mike: NOW, ALL EYES WILL BE
ON DWYANE WADE AS DALLAS WILL
TRY AND STOP THEM.
THEY HAVE TO THE BEEN ABLE TO DO
SO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
AS WADE HAS EXPLODED ONCE AGAIN
WITH 15 OF HIS 37 POINTS IN THIS
PERIOD.
>> Hubie: THE MAIN THING RIGHT
NOW FOR THE MIAMI OFFENSIVE
PEOPLE THAT WHENEVER -- IF WADE
IS MAKING A MOVE THAT YOU HOLD
YOUR SPACING BECAUSE IF DALLAS
RUNS A DOUBLE-TEAM, DWYANE WADE,
THE PASS WILL BE COMING TO YOU,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A
SITUATION WHERE IT'S A CATCH AND
A SHOT.
>> Mike: ANXIOUS MOMENTS HERE AS
THE CROWD NERVOUS.
>> Hubie: MOST DIFFICULT THING,
IF YOU'RE A DALLAS PLAYER, IS
NOT TO FOUL.
YOU KNOW THAT THEY DO NOT WANT
HIM TO GET A WIDE-OPEN SHOT OR A
HIGH-PERCENTAGE SHOT.
AND AS WE ALL KNOW THAT DWYANE
WADE SOMETIMES WILL JUST PUT HIS
HEAD DOWN AND RELY ON HIS
QUICKNESS AND HIS ABILITY TO
FINISH.
>> Mike: HASLEM, PAYTON, O'NEAL,
WADE, AND NOW WALKER COMES IN
FOR HASLEM.
POSEY STAYS IN.
>> Hubie: NOW, NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS WITH THE HEAT, YOU HAVE
ONE TIME-OUT.
SO IF YOU CANNOT GET THE BALL
IN, YOU CAN USE IT.
AND THEN IF THERE IS A SCORE,
YOU KNOW THAT DALLAS HAS A
20-SECOND TIME-OUT.
>> Mike: AGAIN, NEITHER TEAM
WITH A FOUL TO GIVE.
IN THE HANDS OF DWYANE WADE.
>> Hubie: THEY HAVE HOWARD ON
HIM.
>> Mike: WADE LOOKING.
PULLS UP.
BANKS IT IN!
TIE GAME!
WITH 2.8 REMAINING!
TIME-OUT, DALLAS.
THE REMARKABLE DWYANE WADE WITH
39!
>> Hubie: REMARKABLE IS RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT THE ANGLE?
LOOK AT THE ANGLE OF THIS SHOT
AND HE STILL PLAYS THE BOARD.
THE ABILITY TO GET THE BUMP AND
HANG IN THE AIR.
>> Mike: GRIFFIN RIGHT WITH HIM.
AND WADE USING THE GLASS SO
BEAUTIFULLY AS HE SO OFTEN DOES.
NOW WITH 17 POINTS HERE IN THE
FOURTH QUARTER, WE ARE WATCHING
A VERY SPECIAL YOUNG PLAYER.
>> Hubie: HE KEPT HIS DRIBBLE.
AND THEN LOOK AT THIS ANGLE, THE
ABILITY TO HANG IN THE AIR AND
STILL PLAY THE BOARD.
>> Mike: NOW, WITH 2.8
REMAINING, DALLAS CALLS THEIR
FINAL TIME-OUT.
YOU SEE THE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS
FOR WADE AT CRUNCH TIME.
CERTAINLY PLENTY OF TIME WITH
2.8 LEFT.
THE CATCH DRIBBLE OR CATCH
PASS --
>> Hubie: PLENTY OF TIME HERE,
MIKE.
>> Mike: AGAIN, THE HEAT, NO
FOULS TO GIVE.
>> Hubie: NOW, YOU KNOW THAT THE
EMPHASIS IS GOING TO BE ON
NOWITZKI AND TERRY.
THEY HAVE HOWARD TAKING THE
BASKETBALL OUT OF BOUNDS.
THE OTHER PEOPLE, MAKE SURE THAT
YOU'RE SPACED PROPERLY, BECAUSE
IF IT HAPPENS QUICK AND THE PASS
COMES TO YOU, YOU MUST BE READY
TO CATCH AND SHOOT.
>> Mike: HOWARD WILL INBOUND.
REMEMBER, AT THE END OF GAME
THREE, NOWITZKI INBOUNDED TO
HOWARD, BUT THERE'S MORE TIME
NOW.
HOWARD LOOKING.
TERRY.
TERRY.
PUTS IT UP FOR THE WIN!
[ BUZZER ]
NO GOOD!
OVERTIME!
>> Hubie: BEAUTIFUL EXECUTION.
TERRY ELEVATED AND THEN GIVE
MIAMI'S DEFENSE CREDIT.
THEY COVERED THAT AND THEY
FORCED A FADE ON THE RELEASE OF
THAT SHOT.
NOW, JUST WATCH THIS.
LOOK -- THEY ALL CAME IN THERE
AND THEN THEY FORCED TERRY TO
LEAN BACK A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR.
>> Mike: WELL CONTESTED AND FOR
THE TEN MANY TIME IN THESE 2006
NBA PLAYOFFS, WE'RE GOING TO
OVERTIME.
5:00 UP ON THE CLOCK.

EACH TEAM GETS THREE TIME-OUTS.

THE GREAT PLAYERS PLAY GREAT
HERE.
ANOTHER BANKER, WADE.
41!
>> Hubie: IT'S JUST AMAZING.
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS 19 POINTS
NOW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER IN
OVERTIME.
>> Mike: DAMPIER, TRYING TO HOLD
ON, KEEPS IT ALIVE.
AND NOWITZKI SAVES IT.
>> Hubie: THE THING IS SETTLE
DOWN.
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.
>> Mike: HARRIS ON THE PULL-UP.
AND O'NEAL FALLS DOWN.
A LOOSE-BALL FOUL.
>> Hubie: HE WAS PUSHED.
GOOD CALL BY JOE DeROSA.
>> Mike: THEY'RE GOING TO CALL
IT AGAINST HASLEM.
OH,OH, MY.
THIS IS BEFORE O'NEAL GRABBED
IT.
SO HASLEM IS FOULED OUT NOW WITH
HIS SIXTH FOUL.
WATCH NUMBER 40, HASLEM.
>> Hubie: KEEP AN EYE.
HE'S ON NOWITZKI RIGHT HERE.
OH, YEAH HE HE HIT HIM.
HE JUST HIT HIM RIGHT THERE WITH
THE FOREARM.
AND JOEY CRAWFORD RIGHT ON THAT.
RIGHT ON THE BASELINE.
>> Mike: THAT'S A BIG MISS FOR
THE MIAMI HEAT.
HASLEM, WHO'S DEFENDED NOWITZKI
SO WELL, HE'S DONE.
WALKER COMES IN.
SO POSEY WILL GUARD NOWITZKI.
AND HE'S DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB
AS WELL IN THE SERIES.
TERRY.
NOWITZKI LOOKS UP AT THE SHOT
CLOCK.
TERRY FOR THREE.
WON'T GO.
O'NEAL TIPS IT AND POSEY TRACKS
IT DOWN.
>> Hubie: THEY'VE HAD GOOD
LOOKS, MIKE.
IN THE FIRST TWO POSSESSIONS,
THEY HAD A LOT OF MOVEMENT, A
LOT OF SCREENING, AND THEY'RE
GETTING GOOD LOOKS AT THE
BASKET.
>> Mike: HARRIS TRYING TO HARASS
WADE.
WADE.
SHORT.
>> Hubie: THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED
TO SEE.
>> Mike: TERRY.
COAST TO COAST.
IT'S HOWARD.
AND HE'LL SHOOT TWO FREE THROWS.
SMART PLAY FOR TERRY.
>> Hubie: ABSOLUTELY.
I LIKE THAT A LOT.
NOW, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
FASTBREAK MUCH IN THIS FOURTH
QUARTER AND OVERTIME MAINLY
BECAUSE MIAMI HAS BEEN SCORING.
BUT THEY CATCH MIAMI NOT BEING
ALERT HERE.
BECAUSE WHEN JASON PICKED THAT
BALL UP, HE SAW THAT HE HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY, AND HE JUST OUTRAN
THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE
DRIBBLE.
>> Mike: LET'S SEND IT TO LISA
SALTERS.
>> Lisa: MIKE, PAT RILEY CALLED
HIS TEAM BACK OVER BEFORE THE
OVERTIME AND HE SAID, HEY, IT'S
NOT GOOD FORTUNE OR BEING LUCKY
THAT WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW.
HE SAID, WE HAVE EARNED THE
RIGHT TO BE HERE.
NOW, GO PLAY LIKE IT.
MIKE?
>> Mike: THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN
IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS TERRY
CALMLY KNOCKS DOWN TWO CLUTCH
FREE THROWS.
TIED AGAIN.
[ WHISTLE ]
AND THEY FOUL SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
SO HE'S IN THE HACK-A-SHAQ.
O'NEAL WHO'S JUST 2-12 FROM THE
LINE.
WILL NOT GO YET BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT IN THE PENALTY.
>> Hubie: THEY GOT TO TAKE IT ON
THE SIDE.
YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE, DEVIN
HARRIS JUST CAME RIGHT UP AND
FOULED SHAQ IMMEDIATELY.
>> Mike: IT'S ONLY THE FIRST
TEAM FOUL.
THEY'VE GOT FOUL HIM QUICKLY.
NOW, THEY FALL BACK IN THE ZONE.
>> Hubie: THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY'VE BEEN ZONING MOST OUT OF
BOUNDS.
>> Mike: WALKER.
O'NEAL.
PUTS IT IN!
BEAUTIFUL PASS BY ANTOINE
WALKER.
HE CAUGHT THE DOUBLE-TEAM AND HE
LOOKED FOR SHAQ IMMEDIATELY.
>> Mike: O'NEAL, AS SOON AS HE
GOT IT, PUT IT UP BEFORE THE
DEFENSE COULD CONVERGE.
UNDER TWO MINUTES LEFT IN
OVERTIME.
NOWITZKI.
OFF THE MARK.
WADE LOST IT.
OUT OF THE BOUNDS?
DALLAS BALL.
THE TWO OFFICIALS CHECKING WITH
EACH OTHER.
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY IT WAS
DEFLECTED OFF OF HIS HAND.
OOH, THAT'S CLOSE.
IT LOOKED LIKE WADE TOUCHED IT
LAST.
>> Hubie: THAT WAS A COIN TOSS.
>> Mike: CALL IT AN IFFY.
>> Hubie: YEAH.
GARY PAYTON OVERPLAYING JASON
TERRY.
>> Mike: DEVIN HARRIS KNOCKS IT
DOWN.
DEVIN HARRIS TIES THE GAME AT
97-97.
>> Hubie: HE'S BEEN OPEN A
NUMBER OF TIMES.
HE JUST HAS TO PLAY WITH
CONFIDENCE HERE WHEN YOU GO FROM
HERE TO THE END OF THIS
OVERTIME.
[ WHISTLE ]
>> Mike: AND THERE THEY HAVE THE
FOUL ON O'NEAL.
SO THAT'S THE SECOND TEAM FOUL.
>> Hubie: THIS IS PREDETERMINED
ABOUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO
DO.
NOW, WATCH SHAQ, RIGHT TO THE
RIGHT THERE.
SHAQ JUST PUT THE FOREARM UP AND
CAUGHT HARRIS.
NOW, THEY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT
TONIGHT ON THE SIGHT OUT OF
BOUNDS PLAY.
ANYTIME THERE IS A FOUL OR DEAD
BALL ON THE SIDE, DALLAS HAS
BEEN GOING TO A TWO-THREE ZONE.
>> Mike: THERE'S FOUR TEAM
FOULS.
>> Hubie: THEY JUST TOOK OUT
DAMPIER AND MATCHED UP MAN TO
MAN.
NOWITZKI IS THE CENTER.
THEY'RE PLAYING SMALL.
>> Mike: TRYING TO GET IT OUT OF
WADE'S HANDS.
PAYTON DEFLECTED BY NOWITZKI.
FOUR ON THE SHOT CLOCK.
>> Hubie: GOOD STRATEGY RIGHT
HERE.
>> Mike: PAT RILEY WILL CALL
TIME-OUT WITH 2:02 REMAINING IN
OVERTIME.
THE HEAT AND THE MAVERICKS TIED
AT 97-97 HERE IN THE NBA FINALS.
HEY, GUYS, ARE YOU HEARIN' THIS?
I JUST DIED
IN YOUR ARMS TONIGHT 
THAT'S PERFECT.
PERFECT SONG.
YOU KNOW, IF I DIDN'T KNOW
ANY BETTER,
I'D THINK WE WAS BEING WATCHED
BY THOSE SIRIUS SATELLITES.
I JUST DIED IN YOUR ARMS 
OH, HEY.
AT SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO,
WE DO NOT USE OUR SATELLITES
TO WATCH YOU.
WE JUST PLAY
GREAT SONGS ALL THE TIME,
SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT.
OH GOOD, 'CAUSE THAT COULD
MAKE THINGS REAL BAD FOR US.
( chuckling )
YEAH, IT WOULD.
IT'S LIKE WE KNOW.
HEAR THE SPORTS, TALK
AND 100% COMMERCIAL-FREE MUSIC
YOU WANT.
SIRIUS, THE BEST RADIO
ON RADIO.
>> Mike: JUST OVER TWO MINUTES
REMAINING IN OVER-TEAM.
TIED AT 97-97.
UDONIS HASLEM, A KEY PLAYER FOR
MIAMI, HAS FOULED OUT.
MEANWHILE, SAGANA DIOP HAS
FOULED OUT FOR THE DALLAS
MAVERICKS.
THERE'S FOUR LEFT ON THE SHOT
CLOCK.
DIRK NOWITZKI HAS TRUGLED WITH
HIS SHOT, AGAIN 7-18 FROM THE
FIELD, BUT HIS TEAMMATES HAVE
PICKED IMHAD UP.
DWYANE WADE HAS BEEN BRILLIANT
ONCE AGAIN WITH 41.
A BIG POSSESSION RIGHT NOW.
FOUR TO SHOOT AS MIAMI WILL
INBOUND.
NEAL'S ON THE BENCH TO AVOID THE
HACK-A-SHAQ.
THAT CHANGES AGAIN WHEN YOU GET
TWO MINUTES AND UNDER IN THE
FOURTH QUARTER AND OVERTIME.
WADE WANT THE BALL.
HERE'S THE DOUBLE-TEAM.
WADE.
PUTS IT UP.
AND A 24-SECOND VIOLATION.
GREAT DEFENSE.
>> Hubie: THE DEFENSE WAS
OUTSTANDING.
IT'S TOUGH TO RUN A PLAY FROM
THE SIDE LIKE THAT WITH ONLY
FOUR SECONDS ON THE CLOCK AND
THEN IF YOU RUN THAT DOUBLE-TEAM
ON THE MAN TO MAKES THE CATCH,
ESPECIALLY THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
WADE, SEE, AS SOON AS THEY RAN
HIM TO THAT SPOT, BOOM, WATCH
THE DOUBLE-TEAM.
THE DOUBLE-TEAM COOMBS QUICKLY
AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO FORCE
HIM BEHIND THE BACKBOARD.
TERRIFIC DEFENSE.
>> Mike: O'NEAL TRYING TO COME
INTO THE GAME.
THEY'RE GOING TO LET HIM IN.
WE'RE AT THE TWO-MINUTE MARK.
>> Hubie: HERE COMES DAMPIER.
YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR THIS
NOW.
>> Mike: LITTLE CHESS MATCH
BETWEEN THE TWO COACHES.
>> Hubie: WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT
AND THE OTHER TEAM MUST BE THE
ONE THAT HAS TO MAKE THE QUICK
SUBSTITUTION, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.
PAT RILEY BY BRINGING SHAQ THEN
DALLAS AT THE OTHER END.
THE MAN WHO'S COMING INTO THE
GAME HAS GOT TO BE READY.
YOU JUST DO NOT WANT THE
REFEREES TO SAY, HEY, HE'S NOT
AT THE TABLE IN TIME.
>> Mike: YOU SEE 1:58 AND
COUNTING.
JASON TERRY'S HAD A 35-POINT
GAME FOR DALLAS.
POSEY STAYING WITH NOWITZKI.
TERRY ON THE DRIVE.
FLIPS IT INSIDE.
AND O'NEAL WITH THE FOUL ON
DAMPIER.
SO DAMPIER WILL SEEK TWO FREE
THROWS.
>> Hubie: NOW, THAT WAS A
BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED PLAY AND
THE PENETRATION AND THEN WATCH
AS WE -- AS SHAQ STEPS UP.
THEY DROP THE BALL OFF TO
DAMPIER.
AND THEN FORTUNATELY, SHAQ
RECOVERED.
WHEN YOU GET IN THAT SITUATION,
DAMPIER'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
THE CATCH AND THEN DO THE QUICK
POWER DUNK.
>> Mike: DAMPIER IS NOT A GOOD
FREE-THROW SHOOTER, 50% IN THESE
FINALS, 64% IN HIS CAREER AND
THAT ONE NOT EVEN CLOSE.
>> Hubie: WELL, ALL OF THE
DALLAS CENTERS ARE A LIABILITY.
JUST LIKE SHAQ, MOURNING IS THE
CLOSEST GUY HERE WHO SHOOTS IN
THE 60s.
OF ALL OF THE CENTERS AVAILABLE
FOR MIAMI OR DALLAS.
>> Mike: AMAZING HOW MANY GAMES
COME DOWN TO KNOCKING DOWN FREE
THROWS.
AND DAMPIER, NICE RECOVERY.
MAVERICKS BY ONE.
BOTH TEAMS AGAIN WITH MULTIPLE
TIME-OUTS HERE IN THE OVERTIME.
[ WHISTLE ]
WADE SPINNING.
AND A BLOCKING FOUL CALLED.
MAVERICKS WANTED A TRAVEL BUT IT
LOOKED LIKE HE GOT HIT.
>> Hubie: NO, HE GOT HIT.
AS SOON AS HE CAME OVER THAT
SCREEN, YOU'RE GONNA WATCH, JUST
WATCH AS HOWARD STEPS UP HERE.
BOOM, RIGHT THERE.
BOTH GUYS WERE MOVING.
FIRST HOWARD GOT HIM, AND THEN
HARRIS GOT HIM.
>> Mike: THEY CALL IT ON HARRIS,
HIS FIVE.
THE LAST FOUL TO GIVE.
THE LAST ONE BETH TEAMS NOW IN
THE PENALTY.
>> Hubie: RIGHT NOW THIS IS
GOOD.
DALLAS WILL JUMP INTO THE
TWO-THREE ZONE BECAUSE SHAQ IS
IN THERE.
>> Mike: PAYTON ON THE DRIVE.
POSEY.
WALKER WITH THREE ON THE SHOT
CLOCK.
WALKER FLIPS IT UP.
WON'T GO.
NOWITZKI A BIG REBOUND.
>> Hubie: GOOD RECOVERY THAT
TIME BY THE FRONT LINE IN THE
DEFENSIVE ZONE.
>> Mike: WE'RE AT THE
AMERICANAIRLINES ARENA.
A MINUTE REMAINING IN OVERTIME.
HOWARD DOUBLE-TEAMED.
FLOATS IT UP.
[ WHISTLE ]
AND A WHISTLE AND A FOUL, AND
HOWARD WILL SHOOT TWO FREE
THROWS.
>> Hubie: NOW, THAT IS A
DIFFICULT SHOT IS.
>> Mike: O'NEAL, HIS FIFTH FOUL.
>> Hubie: JOSH HOWARD MADE A
TERRIFIC MOVE.
THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT
THE CLOCK GOING DOWN.
AND AS HE MADE HIS MOVE OFF THE
DRIBBLE, JUST WATCH THIS SHOT.
THIS IS A TOUGH SHOT.
SEE, RIGHT THERE, HE HAS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
SEE?
AND HE JUST PUTS THAT FLOATER UP
THERE AND TAKES THE HIT.
>> Mike: HOWARD, 79% FROM THE
LINE IN THESE PLAYOFFS.
SHORT ONCE AGAIN.
THAT'S HIS FIRST MISS.
HE WAS 9 FOR 9.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WITH FIVE
FOULS.
>> Hubie: HE'S HAD A GREAT
ALL-AROUND GAME WITH THE 10
REBOUNDS AND THE OVER 25 POINTS.
OF.
>> Mike: MISSES A PAIR!
THE LEAD REMAINS ONE.
>> Hubie: THEY'RE IN ZONE AGAIN.
>> Mike: WADE.
TIED UP.
[ WHISTLE ]
HAS TO CALL TIME.
EXCELLENT DEFENSE FROM HARRIS
NOT GOING FOR THE FAKE.
>> Hubie: WELL, SEE, THEY'RE IN
THAT ZONE BECAUSE THEY NOT WANT
YOU TO RUN YOUR SET OFFENSE.
STHAT WAY EVERYONE IN IF AN AREA
CAN HELP ON DWYANE WADE OFF THE
DRIBBLE.
NOW, THIS IS JUST GOOD FOOT
QUICKNESS BY DEVIN HARRIS,
FORCING HIM TO CALL TIME-OUT.
WE OFFER MAJOR CARRIERS,
GREAT PLANS,
AND TOP-OF-THE-LINE PHONES,
WHICH, TOGETHER
WITH THE HELPFUL ADVICE
TO MAKE SURE YOU FIND
THE EXACT PHONE YOU NEED,
IS THE REASON WHY
OUR SALES ASSOCIATES
ARE RATED NUMBER ONE IN
WIRELESS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.
RADIO SHACK -- YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD WIRELESS STORE.
>> Mike: WHAT A GREAT PLAYOFF
RUN IT'S BEEN IN THESE 2006
POSTSEASON GAMES HERE IN THE
FINALS.
GAME SIX WILL BE IN DALLAS ON
TUESDAY NIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE IT FOR YOU ON ABC.
COVERAGE STARTS AT 8:30.
TIPOFF SHORTLY AFTER 9:00.
AND THEN A GAME SEVEN, IF
NECESSARY, IN DALLAS.
THE MAVERICKS HOPING TO TAKE A
3-2 LEAD AND THEN WOULD HAVE TWO
HOME GAMES TO TRY AND WIN THEIR
FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP, BATTLING ON
THE ROAD ONCE AGAIN, WHICH
THEY'VE DONE THROUGHOUT THE
PLAYOFFS.
MEANWHILE, MIAMI, ONLY DOWN BY
ONE.
>> Hubie: THE ZONE BY DALLAS HAS
DEFINITELY CAUSED A PROBLEM,
MIKE.
EARLY IN THE GAME AND AT
DIFFERENT TIMES.
NOW, RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE SEVEN
SECONDS ON THE CLOCK, AND IT
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF
THEY MATCH UP PLAYING MAN TO MAN
OR THEY GO INTO TWO-THREE ZONE.
>> Mike: THE HEAT DOWN TO JUST
ONE TIME-OUT REMAINING.
>> Hubie: THEY'RE MATCHING UP
RIGHT NOW.
THEY HAVE HOWARD ON THE INBOUND
PASS.
>> Mike: PAYTON.
>> Hubie: BRINGING -- ON THE
BASELINE, THEY'RE BRINGING
DWYANE WADE.
>> Mike: PAYTON ON THE DRIVE,
GARY PAYTON BANKS IT IN!
AND THE HEAT BACK UP BY ONE.
TIME-OUT, DALLAS.
GARY PAYTON WITH ANOTHER BIG
SHOT!
>> Hubie: HOW ABOUT THE FINISH?
NOW, WE COULD SEE THE DEFENSE
DID NOT GIVE HIM A LANE.
HE MAKES THIS LANE.
NOW, JUST WATCH THE FINISH OFF
THE DRIBBLE.
HOW ABOUT THIS WITH THE LEFT
HAND?
LEFT HAND AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT
UP HIGH OFF THE GLASS.
>> Mike: HE HAD THE BIG JUMPER
IN GAME THREE IN THE
COME-FROM-BEHIND WIN.
PAYTON IN HIS THIRD NBA FINALS.
CAME UP EMPTY IN THE FIRST TWO,
ONE WITH LAKERS AND ONE WITH THE
SONICS.
PAYTON PUTS THE HEAT UP BY ONE.
THIS WAS GAME THREE.
AND IN THE FINAL SECONDS OF THAT
TERRIFIC COME-FROM-BEHIND WIN,
PAYTON KNOCKS IT DOWN.
FORMER 20-POINT SCORER,
SEVEN-TIME ALL-STAR, AND NOW A
BACKUP PLAYER, BUT HE PLAYS
CRUNCH TIME.
AND YOU SEE HE'S PLAYED SO MANY
PLAYOFF GAMES WITHOUT WINNING A
TITLE.
HE WANTS TO TRY AND GET THAT
RING THIS YEAR.
>> Hubie: THE MOST AMAZING STAT
ABOUT HIS CAREER, HE'S BEEN IN
THIS LEAGUE 16 YEARS.
HE HAS ONLY MISSED SEVEN GAMES
BY INJURY IN 16 YEARS, TEN YEARS
HE DID NOT MISS A GAME.
NOW, THAT'S UNHEARD OF.
>> Mike: HE'S AN EIGHT-TIME
ALL-STAR FORMER DEFENSIVE PLAYER
OF THE YEAR BUT THAT BIG BUCKET
PUTS THEM UP BY ONE.
DALLAS WILL HAVE THE BALL AS
THEY'RE DOWN TO THEIR FINAL
TIME-OUT.
>> Hubie: DALLAS RIGHT NOW HAS
ONE TIME-OUT THAT TAKES THE
PRESSURE OFF IN CASE SOMETHING
HAPPENS AND THEY CANNOT GET THE
BALL INBOUNDS.
WITH THE DIFFERENTIAL OF FIVE
SECONDS ON THE CLOCK, WE ALSO
KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, MAKE OR MISS, MIAMI
WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF
USING THEIR REMAINING ONE
TIME-OUT IF THEY NEEDED IT.
>> Mike: HOWARD WILL INBOUND.
DAMPIER, HARRIS, TERRY, AN
NOWITZKI.
HARRIS, THE YOUNG MAN NOT AFRAID
TO TAKE A BIG SHOT.
>> Hubie: HERE COMES NOWITZKI ON
IT'S BASELINE PPOSEY PLAYED HIM
WELL.
>> Mike: TERRY OFF THE SCREEN.
STILL PLENTY OF TIME.
>> Hubie: PLENTY OF TIME.
YOU CAN'T RUSH.
>> Mike: NOWITZKI CALLING FOR
IT.
NOWITZKI ON THE DRIVE.
FALLING AWAY!
IT'S GOOD!
DIRK NOWITZKI GIVES THE
MAVERICKS A ONE-POINT LEAD.
9.1 SECONDS REMAIN, AND THE
MIAMI HEAT CALL THEIR FINAL
TIME-OUT.
>> Hubie: THAT'S WHEN YOUR STAR
PLAYER, YOUR FIRST-TEAM ALL-NBA
PERFORMER OF THE LAST TWO
SEASONS STEPS UP AND WITH
NOTHING GOING TAKES THIS MOVE
RIGHT HERE, ONE ON ONE, INDEBT
BOOS TWO DEFENDERS.
>> Mike: ONE OF HIS MORE
DIFFICULT SHOTS OF THE NIGHT.
HE HAS STRUGGLED BUT THE BIG
BUCKET RIGHT THERE.
AND DALLAS UP BY ONE.
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE MAVERICKS
TO TRY AND GET A STOP AS THE
MIAMI HEAT WILL GET THE BALL
BACK.
THE HEAT OUT OF TIME-OUTS.
AFTER THE TIME-OUT, THEY CAN
ADVANCE THE BALL NOW TO THE
FRONTCOURT.
WHICH IS WHAT THEY'LL DO.
AND YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO TRY
AND GET IT TO DWYANE WADE.
>> Hubie: RIGHT.
YOU GOT TO GET IT TO HIM EARLY.
THE LAST POSSESSION, YOU KNOW, A
LOT OF TIME ELAPSED WHEN THEY
TRY TO RUN 'EM ON THAT BASELINE
SITUATION.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THEY CANNOT
MAKE A CLEAN PASS.
AND EVEN THEN WHEN HE COUNTY IT
CAUGHT IT, THERE WERE TWO
DEFENDer ON HIM.
GET -- TRY TO GET HIM IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SO HE CAN
MAKE THE MOVE AND THEN EVERYONE
ELSE HOLD THEIR SPOTS ON THE
SPOT-UPS.
>> Mike: WHAT A DELILLER THIS
GAME FIVE.
OVERTIME AS THESE TWO TEAMS,
BOTH AGAIN, THEIR FIRST TRIP TO
THE NBA FINALS.
A CHANCE AT THEIR FIRST TITLE
WITH THE SERIES TIED AT 2-2.
AND THE NEXT TWO GAMES LOOMING
IN DALLAS, TEXAS, SUCH AN
IMPORTANT GAME.
THE MIAMI HEAT TRYING TO WIN
THREE STRAIGHT ON THEIR HOME
FLOOR.
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE DEAD IN
THE WATER IN GAME THREE, DOWN 13
AS THE MAVERICKS WERE ON THEIR
WAY TO A 3-0 LEAD.
BUT THEY HAD THE GREAT COMEBACK
IN GAME THREE.
DOMINATED GAME FOUR AND NOW WITH
CHANCE TO WIN IT HERE IN
OVERTIME.
>> Hubie: MAJOR THING RIGHT NOW
IF YOU ARE THE MIAMI HEAT.
OKAY?
WHEN THAT SHOT GOES UP, THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POSITION MUST
CRASH THE OFFENSIVE BOARD IF
THERE'S A MISS.
DALLAS CANNOT FALL ASLEEP.
IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW THAT DALLAS
IS GOING TO BE IN A TWO-THREE
ZONE.
WADE CAN GO INTO THE BACKCOURT.
>> Mike: WADE ON THE DRIVE.
DOUBLE-TEAM.
WADE LOOKING FOR AN OPENING.
HE'S FOULED!
SHOT WON'T GO!
BUT HE WILL SHOOT TWO.
WITH 1.9 REMAINING.
>> Hubie: NOW, THAT WAS AN
INCREDIBLE SITUATION, MAINLY
BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP HIS
DRIBBLE.
NOW, JUST WATCH THIS.
HE ALMOST GOES DOWN.
ALL RIGHT?
AND NOW AS HE SPLITS THROUGH, HE
GETS CAUGHT ON THE LEG OF DEVIN
HARRIS.
>> Mike: THEY CALL THE FOUL ON
NOWITZKI.
THAT'S HIS FOURTH.
>> Hubie: OH, BOY.
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE --
>> Mike: SO WADE, TWO FREE
THROWS.
HE'S 19-23 FROM THE LINE.
ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY GAME FOR
DWYANE WADE.
TIE GAME.
>> Hubie: NOW, DALLAS HAS 1.9
SECONDS BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE
TIME-OUT REMAINING.
>> Mike: JASON TERRY HAVING SOME
WORDS FOR WADE.
BENNETT SALVATORE TELLING HIM TO
GET BACK YIND THE THREE-POINT
LINE.
OH, JOSH HOWARD, HE CALLED
TIME-OUT?
>> Hubie: OH, MY, OH, MY, OH,
MY.
>> Mike: JOSH HOWARD CALLED
TIME.
JOE DeROSA SAID TIME-OUT.
BENNETT SALVATORE WAVING IT OFF.
THAT WOULD BE THEIR FINAL
TIME-OUT AND THEY WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO ADVANCE THE BALL.
>> Hubie: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Mike: THIS IS A HUGE CALL
RIGHT HERE.
AND THEY GIVE THE TIME-OUT.
HOWARD ASKED JOE DeROSA FOR
THE TIME-OUT.
IF THAT'S THE CASE, THE OFFICIAL
HAS TO CALL IT.
>> Hubie: NOW, SEE, THE BENCH,
ALL OF THE COACHES WERE UP
SAYING, NO, NO, NO.
THEY DID NOT WANT THE TIME-OUT.
BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAD ONE
TIME-OUT REMAINING.
>> Mike: IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT
AVERY JOHNSON IS ARGUING ABOUT.
BECAUSE IF HOWARD TURNED TO THE
OFFICIAL AND SAID TIME-OUT, THEY
HAVE TO CALL IT.
THAT WOULD BE THE FINAL
TIME-OUT.
THE GAME IS TIED WITH 1.9
REMAINING.
WADE HAS ONE MORE FREE THROW
COMING UP.
>> Hubie: NOW, WE KNOW THE
PRESSURE IS ON WADE TO MAKE THE
FOUL SHOT.
ALL RIGHT?
THE SITUATION IS THAT IF WADE
MAKES THE FOUL SHOT, DALLAS IS
OUT OF TIME-OUTS.
SO CONSEQUENTLY NOW YOU HAVE TO
TAKE THE BALL OUT ON THE
BASELINE.
THEN SOMETHING OF A LONG PASS
AND A CATCH AND HOPEFULLY THAT
YOU CAN GET OFF A SHOT.
BUT WITH 1.9, YOU CAN MAKE IT.
NOW, KEEP AN EYE RIGHT UP HERE.
>> Mike: YEAH, YOU CAN SEE
HOWARD, PUT HIS HANDS TOGETHER
FOR THE TIME-OUT.
>> Hubie: AND RIGHT THERE, JOE
DeROSA, NOW, CAN YOU SEE THE
COACHING STAFF IMMEDIATELY, DEL
HARRIS AND THEN AVERY JOHNSON
COME OUT TO DISPUTE THAT.
>> Mike: SO HOWARD, THAT'S A
MISTAKE.
IT'S A BAD DECISION, BUT THE
OFFICIALS HAVE TO CALL THE
TIME-OUT.
NOW, YOU NEVER KNOW IF HE'S
LOOKING OVER TO THE BENCH AND
ASKING THE BENCH, DO I CALL
TIME-OUT?
YOU NEVER KNOW.
BUT DeROSA RIGHT AWAY LOOKED
AT HOWARD AND CALLED THE TIME.
SO NOW THEY'RE OUT OF TIME-OUTS.
SO IF WADE HITS THE FREE THROW,
THEY CAN'T ADVANCE THE BALL.
THEY HAVE TO GO THE LENGTH OF
THE FLOOR.
>> Hubie: THE MAIN THING RIGHT
NOW, THE PRESSURE IS ON DWYANE
WADE TO MAKE THE FOUL SHOT.
>> Mike: TERRY AGAIN WALKS PAST
HIM.
YOU'VE SEEN THE GAMESMANSHIP A
NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE
POSTSEASON.
WADE WITH 42.
HEAT LEAD!
>> Hubie: YOU GOT TO PUT A MAN
ON THE GUY OUT OF BOUNDS.
AND THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.
THEY'RE GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO
PICK OUT THE PASS.
THAT'S -- YOU GOT TO WATCH NOW
BECAUSE IF THEY MAKE A CATCH
OVER HALFCOURT, THEY'LL GET A
DECENT SHOT.
>> Mike: JUST GET IT IN.
HARRIS PUTS IT UP FOR THE WIN!
OH, NO GOOD!
AND MIAMI WINS AGAIN!
TO TAKE A 3-2 LEAD.
>> Mike: MARK CUBAN FURIOUS.
THE DALLAS MAVERICKS OBVIOUSLY
DISAPPOINTED.
ANOTHER THRILLER.
AND THIS IS THE KEY MOVE AS WADE
ONCE AGAIN FEARLESSLY GOING.
THEY CALLED THAT FOUL ON
NOWITZKI.
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT THERE WAS A
FOUL ON HIM.
>> Hubie: THEY HAD NOWITZKI WITH
HIS HAND ON HIS BACK BUT THEY
ALSO HAD HARRIS.
IT COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY.
>> Mike: THEY'LL GO WITH TEXAS
UP 3-2.
LISA SALTERS.
>> Lisa: 33 POINTS, THAT'S A
MIAMI HEAT PLAYOFF RECORD.
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND
ON THAT LAST FREE THROW?
>> TRIAL WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH
MY MIND WAS LAST NIGHT WHEN I
WAS IN THE GYM WITH MY COUSIN,
AND, HE WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME
ADVICE TELLING ME EVERYTHING.
I WAS TELLING HIM, I DON'T MISS
THESE.
THAT'S ALL I WAS THINKING WHEN I
WAS UP THERE.
>> Lisa: YOU STRUGGLED EARLY
FROM THE FIELD, BUT YOU TURNED
IT ON LATE AGAIN.
WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU?
>> YOU KNOW, LIKE AT THE GAME AS
TWO DIFFERENT GAME.
THE FIRST HALF IT WAS A BAD
GAME.
YOU THE EKD BUT THE SECOND HALF
WHEN MY TEAMMATES NEED IMMEDIATE
TO STEP UP, I DID IT.
THIS WAS A GREAT VICTORY.
>> Lisa: ONE WIN AWAY FROM A
CHAMPIONSHIP.
CAN YOU SMELL IT?
>> YEAH, WE CAN SMELL IT.
DALLAS PLAYS WELL AT HOME.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
>> Lisa: ANOTHER GREAT
PERFORMANCE BY YOU.
BUT THE SHOT THAT EVEN TOOK THIS
INTO OVERTIME, THAT HANGING-OFF
THE BOARD SHOT, HOW DID YOU MAKE
THAT GO IN JSHS.
>> JUST MY WILL I DIDN'T WANT TO
MISS IT.
YOU KNOW, GRIFFIN IS A VERY
STRONG PLAYER, BUT ONCE I BUMPED
HIM AND GOT A LITTLE SPACE, I
JUST USED MY BACKBOARD SHOT I
ALWAYS USE AND IT WENT IN FOR
ME.
>> Lisa: CONGRATULATIONS.
LET'S GO OVER TO SHAQUILLE.
WHEN JOSH HOWARD CALLED THAT
TIME-OUT AND TRIED IT TAKE IT
BACK, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
BECAUSE I SAW YOU -- YOU WERE
KIND OF TELLING PAT WHAT WAS
GOING ON.
WHAT DID HAPPEN?
>> I THOUGHT THEY WERE OUT OF
TIME-OUTS AT THAT POINT.
AFTER HE CALLED THE TIME-OUT,
THEY WERE OUT OF TIME-OUTS AND
COULDN'T ADVANCE THE BALL.
>> Lisa: WHEN THEY'VE GONE TO
THE HACK-A-SHAQ, WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING WHEN THEY WENT TO THE
HACK-A-SHAQ IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER AND IN OVERTIME?
>> I WAS PROBABLY THINKING TOO
MUCH ABOUT MAKING THEM.
I FELT GOOD.
MY RHYTHM FELT GOOD.
THEY JUST DIDN'T GO DOWN.
DWYANE WADE HAD MY BACK TONIGHT.
WE JUST WANT TO GO UP THERE AND
TRY IT GET THIS NEXT ONE.
>> Lisa: HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE -- YOU'VE SEEN A LOST
GREAT PERFORMANCES.
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT
DWYANE DID TONIGHT?
>> HIDE'S SAY -- I'D SAY HE'S
THE BEST.
HE'S A GREAT PLAYER.
>> Lisa: ONE WIN AWAY FROM
POSSIBLY YOUR FOURTH TITLE.
I MEAN, HOW CLOSE IS IT FOR YOU?
>> WE JUST GOT TO GO THERE AND
GET IT DONE.
WE COMING TO A HOSTILE ARENA.
WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE
COMPLAINING AGAIN ABOUT TODAY.
SO WE JUST HAVE TO DO IT.
>> Lisa: CONGRATULATIONS.
MIKE?
>> Mike: ALL RIGHT, LISA.
THE HEAT WIN THREE STRAIGHT ON
THEIR HOME FLOOR.

THE VETERAN, GARY PAYTON HITS 
THE SHOT AND THE HEAT TAKE THE 
LEAD. 
>> IT'S JUST A SHOT.
GOING DOWN 3-0, AND NOW WE'RE 
2-1.
>> PAYTON'S SHOT CAPPED OFF A 
FURIOUS COMEBACK BY DWYANE WADE 
AND THE HEAT. 
THE MAVERICKS LED BY 13 AT 
MIDWAY POINT IN THE FOURTH 
QUARTER WERE SEARCHING FOR 
ANSWERS AFTER FAILING TO TAKE A 
3-0 LEAD. 
>> YOU GIVE THEM CREDIT, THEY 
TOOK THE GAME AWAY FROM US. 
WE WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH OUR 
EXECUTION DOWN THE STRETCH, 
MAINTAINING THE LEAD AND HAVING 
THE KILLER INSTINCT WASN'T 
THERE TONIGHT.
>> IS IT ONE OF THE MORE 
MEANINGFUL SHOTS? 
>> IT'S NOT MEANINGFUL YET.
>> GAME FOUR OF THE NBA FINALS 
IS TONIGHT. 
THE DALLAS MAVERICKS CAN TAKE A 
COMMANDING 3-1 LEAD WITH A WIN 
TONIGHT.
IT'S DESPERATION TIME FOR THE 
HEAT. 
>> THE FOURTH QUARTER THAT 
MIAMI PUT ON, WHAT DWYANE WADE 
DID IN THE LAST SEVEN MINUTES, 
COMING BACK AND NOT GOING DOWN 
3-0 IS PARAMOUNT. 
IT'S 2-1, IF IT'S 2-2 TONIGHT, 
ALL NET, ALL EVEN.
GREAT NBA FINALS. 
>> 2-1 IS A BIG DIFFERENCE AND 
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT THE 
SERIES TO BE TIED SO EVERY GAME 
IN A SERIES CAN CHANGE MOMENTUM 
SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE READY TO 
PLAY.

THIS. 
LET'S TAKE THIS GAME TONIGHT 
AND WIN THE SERIES. 
ONE, TWO, THREE, HEAT!
>> GET THIS THING GOING, BABY!
WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THAT?
ON THREE. 
ONE, TWO, THREE, MAVERICKS! 
>> SIGNS ARE OUT THERE THAT 
WOULD POINT TOWARDS DALLAS 
BOUNCING BACK FROM WHAT WAS A 
DISAPPOINTING LOSS IN GAME 
THREE, THIS IS A TEAM THAT 
SEEMS TO RESPOND WELL TO 
ADVERSITY AND HAVE BOUNCED BACK 
FROM A LOT OF DIFFICULT DEFEATS 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEASON.
>> AS GAME FOUR GOT UNDERWAY, 
IT SEEMED DALLAS HAD PUT THEIR 
LATE-GAME COLLAPSE BEHIND THEM 
AND LOOKED READY TO REGAIN 
CONTROL OF THE SERIES.
>> JASON TERRY WILL DRIVE IT 
AND SLAM IT.
>> DALLAS STARTING EARLY WITH 
THE TURNOVERS.
THAT'S WHAT HURT MIAMI IN THE 
GAME THE OTHER NIGHT.

TIE IT UP.

NOWITZKI SPINS AROUND AND PUTS 
THE SHOT UP.

I TELL YOU, HE HITS SOME OF THE 
TOUGHEST SHOTS, THAT GUY.

THE GAME AND DALLAS LEADING BY 
ONE, MIAMI ONCE AGAIN HAD TO 
DEAL WITH A SETBACK.
>> DIRK ON THE LEFT WING, 
DRIBBLE DRIVE TO THE LANE, HE'S 
GOING HARD INSIDE.
IT'S A DRIVE ON SHAQ, FOUR 
SECONDS.
>> AND ALONZO MOURNING IS OFF 
THE BENCH WITH 7:36 LEFT IN THE 
FIRST QUARTER.
>> WHILE MIAMI WOULD LOOKOR 
THE VETERAN TO STEP IN FOR 
O'NEAL IT WAS TIME FOR THEIR 
YOUNG SUPERSTAR TO EXERT HIS 
WILL. 
>> WADE, DOUBLE-TEAMED. 
R60 DALLAS RUN. 
WADE PULSE UP FROM 18.

MIAMI WITHIN ONE. 
THROUGH THE LEGS AND CROSSED 
OVER RIGHT TO LEFT. 
>> MOVING TO HIS RIGHT. 
HE CROSSES OVER.
WADE OUT FRONT NOW AT THE TOP 
OF THE KEY. 
FIRES AND HITS. 
>> THE MAIN THING IS WE GOT TO 
CONTAIN HIM.
WE GOT TO CONTAIN HIM.
>> BASE SIDE LEFT ON HOWARD.
DWYANE WADE BACKING IN, SPINS 
BASE LINE UP OFF THE GLASS AND 
IN. 
ALL DWYANE WADE ALL THE TIME. 
>> HE'S GIVING YOU THE TOTAL 
GAME. 
THE DRIVE AND MAINLY THE JUMP 
SHOT. 
HE'S GOT THAT SHOT AND THE 
DEFENDER IS AT A MAJOR 
DISADVANTAGE. 
>> DWYANE WADE WAS UNSTOPPABLE, 
SCORING 21 POINTS IN THE FIRST 
HALF. 
MEANWHILE, THE FRANCHISE'S 
ORIGINAL SUPERSTAR LOOKED LIKE 
THE MAN WHO ONCE WON A PAIR OF 
DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR 
AWARDS. 
>> STACKHOUSE ON THE DRIBBLE, 
FINDS NOWITZKI. 
TO SHANDON ANDERSON, SEVEN TO 
SHOOT.
HE SPINS AND SHOOTS IT UP.

STARTS THE FAST BREAK.
>> AND THE MAVERICKS SCORED 16 
POINTS IN THE FIRST 5:45 AND 
THEN FOR THE NEXT QUARTER AND A 
HALF, DALLAS ONLY MANAGED 28 
POINTS AFTER A QUICK START AND 
DOWN 54-44.

THIS TIME.
30 FOR WADE.

HE BACKS IN AND SPINS BASE LINE 
AND GOT AWAY. 
HE DUMPS IT AND WAS FOULED. 
THE BIGGEST LEAD FOR MIAMI AS 
THE DIESEL HAMMERS IT HOME. 
>> IT SEEMED NOTHING COULD SLOW 
DOWN SHAQUILLE O'NEAL AND THE 
HEAT, NOTHING SHORT OF A MAJOR 
JUST A MOMENT.
>> OH, MY GOODNESS, THAT'S GOT 
TO BE A FOUL. 
AND STACKHOUSE IS DEFINITELY 
GOING TO GET A FLAGRANT.
>> SURELY THAT'S GOING TO BE A 
FLAGRANT.

>> SHAQ WAS CLEARLY SHAKEN UP.
THOUGH HE TRIED TO SHOW HE 
WASN'T AFFECTED.
