ARSAY AND NOT TRUE. 
IT'S TRUE.
JOE KENNEDY HAD A LOT OF MONEY 
D HE WOULD PLAY A LOT ON THE 
STOCK MARKET. 
AND JUST BEFORE THE 1929 STOCK 
MARKET CRASHED, HE WAS GETTING 
HIS SHOE SHINED.
AND THE SHOE SHINE BOY ASKED 
HIM FOR A STOCK TIP.
AND AT THAT POINT, JOE KENNEDY 
SAID THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE IN 
THE STOCK MARKET SO HE MISSED 
THE CRASH OF 1929.
SO I CALLED MY BROKER AND SAID 
GET RID OF EVERYTHING.
HE SAID LET ME GET THIS 
STRAIGHT, YOU WANT TO SELL YOUR 
ENTIRE PORTFOLIO WHICH CONSISTS 
OF ONE SHARE IN I-HOP.
WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE $5?
SHOULD I BUY A CANDY BAR 
PERHAPS.
I HAD THE LAST LAUGH, BECAUSE 
TWO WEEKS LATER, THE MARKET 
CRASHED.
HA, HA! 
I COULD HAVE LOST THAT $5.
IT'S A LAUGHING MATTER TO YOU, 
BUT I'M SCOTTISH. 
THAT'S $5!
[LAUGHTER]
THE STOCK MARKET IS JUST 
GAMBLING FOR PEOPLE IN SUITS. 
I ONCE TOOK A TOUR OF THE 
AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE AND 
LOOKING AROUND -- I GOT A TOUR 
AROUND IT.
AND IT JUST SEEMED TO ME LIKE 
OFFTRACK BETTING. 
IT WAS DEGENERATES, PEOPLE 
YELLING AND SCREAMING AND 
WAVING TICKETS AND EVERYTHING.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH THE STOCK MARKET.
I LIKE TO KEEP MY MONEY 
SOMEWHERE SAFE, SOMEWHERE WHERE 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO STEAL. 
CASH UNDER THE MATTRESS, 
IMIMPORTANTLY TO STEAL. 
YOU GET PAST THE GUARD DOGS AND 
THE MOTE WITH SHARKS. 
YOU'LL FIND TWO TREASURE CHESTS 
IN MY HOUSE.
ONE FILLED WITH GOLD DABLOONS, 
AND ONE FILLED WITH SHARKS. 
SO DON'T EVEN TRY IT. 
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE PRICE 
OF A SHARK IN L.A.
PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK I KNOW A 
LOT ABOUT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
BECAUSE THERE'S A FAMOUS 
AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY TRADER 
WHO'S ALSO CRAIG FERGUSON.
WHENEVER I GOOGLE MYSELF, HE 
COMES UP. 
[LAUGHTER]
GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE 
GUTTER! 
[LAUGHTER]
WHENEVER I GOOGLE MYSELF, BOOM, 
A COURTESY EXPERT -- WELL I GO 
OUT FOR DINNER FIRST, THEN I 
COME HOME.
[LAUGHTER]
WHENEVER I GOOGLE MYSELF, I 
THOUGHT ABOUT CONTACTING HIM, 
BUT IT MAY CAUSE A RIFT IN THE 
WHOLE SPACE-TIME CONTINUE WUM.
-- CONTINUUM. 
MAYBE WE SHOULD SWITCH JOBS.
MAYBE NOT.
JUST FOR A WEEK.
HIS CLIENTS WOULD END UP POUR, 
ACTUALLY AND MY AUDIENCE WOULD 
END UP POORLY ENTERTAINED.
BUT I THINK YOU'RE USED TO IT 
BY NOW. 
I THINK I'VE TOUGHENED YOU UP.
I THINK YOU'RE READY. 
YOU'RE READY FOR A MONOLOGUE BY 
AN ACCOUNTANT.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M CRAIG FERGUSON. 
OH, CHEEKY MONKEYS. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE DOW, 
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
[LAUGHTER]
OH. 
YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO -- NOW I 
HAVE ADMITTED TO GOOGLING 
MYSELF, THERE'S ALSO AN NHL 
HOCKEY PLAYER NAMED CRAIG 
FERGUSON. 
YEAH, SO THAT'S THREE CRAIG 
FERGUSONS.
THERE'S BEEN RUMORS HE'S BEEN 
HANGING AROUND WITH PARIS 
HILTON. 
'S A RUMOR BUT I HEARD ABOUT 
IT -- WHICH MEANS IT MAY 
ACTUALLY BE A LIE.
AND I HAD MY REPORTER CALL ME 
LAST WEEK AND SAID, ARE YOU 
HANGING AROUND WITH PARIS 
HILTON? 
IF YOU START TELLING THE TRUTH 
TO A REPORTER, YOU YOU'LL NEVER 
GET RID OF HIM. 
THEY SAID, ARE YOU SEEING PARIS 
HILTON AND I SAID, I CAN'T 
COMMENT ON THAT AT THIS TIME. 
[LAUGHTER]
SO THEY THINK I AM. 
BUT I'M NOT.
NO. 
[LAUGHTER]
MAYBE THE AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY 
TRADER IS SEEING PARIS HILTON 
AND THAT'S HOW IT CAME UP OR 
SHE'S SEEING THE HOCKEY PLAYER 
AND THE ACCOUNTANT. 
WOULD PARIS DO THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY, SHE'S BACKSTAGE. 
[LAUGHTER]
SHE'S GOT A VERY RECOGNIZABLE 
CACKLE. 
IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD HER, 
IT'S LIKE, HA, HA, HA, HA!
WAIT, MAYBE IN -- MAYBE I'VE 
GOT -- MAYBE I'M CRAZY AND I AM 
BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE. 
MAYBE I AM HOCKEY PLAYER CRAIG 
FERGUSON AND ACCOUNTANT CRAIG 
FERGUSON. 
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I'M SO 
TIRED.
IT WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN THE 
CHIPPED TEETH AND THE 
HAIRPIECE.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT ABOUT IN THE FUTURE IF 
CRAIG FERGUSON IS REMEMBERED AS 
JUST ONE PERSON?
LIKE HISTORY REMEMBERED CRAIG 
FERGUSON, A MAN WHO HAD A GREAT 
CAREER IN HOCKEY AND CURRENCY 
TRADING AND ALSO A BRIEF AND 
INSIGNIFICANT CAREER IN 
BROADCASTING ON CRBTS?
-- CBS? 
THAT'S HEARTENING, SUSPECT IT?
[LAUGHTER]
MAKES ME FEEL RATHER SAD. 
I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A 
COMMERCIAL BREAK. 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH REGIS 
PHILBIN, SNOOP DOGG AND JOHN 
LANDIS, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
[APPLAUSE]
CRAIG: HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
I'M DOING THIS WEEK?
IT'S COUNTDOWN FOR LAS VEGAS 
WEEK. 
I'M GOING TO LAS VEGAS FOR THE 
FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND, YES, 
I'M VERY EXCITED. 
[APPLAUSE]
I LIKE GOING TO LAS VEGAS.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOING TO 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES WITHOUT THE 
INCONVENIENCE OF GOING THERE. 
THEY'VE GOT THE PARIS CASINO. 
I CAN GO TO THE ORLEANS.
THERE'S THE NEW YORK. 
THEY NEED A SCOTLAND CASINO.
WHERE, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S 
CAUTIOUS WITH THEIR MONEY.
THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD.
NO, MAYBE NOT.
[LAUGHTER]
GUESS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 
TODAY?
THIS IS TRUE, THIS IS REALLY 
TRUE. 
THIS HAPPENED TO ME TODAY.
I WAS IN STARBUCKS, YOU KNOW I 
ENJOY A FRAPPAMOCHACINO.
AND I'M STANDING BEHIND 
SOMEONE, A SMALL PERSON WITH A 
HAT ON. 
AND I GO, THAT'S MARY INDICATE 
OLSEN.
IT WAS MARY KATE OLSEN AHEAD OF 
ME IN LINE. 
IT REALLY WAS?
IMREALLY FOND OF THE OLSEN 
TWINS, MARY KATE AND OSAMA. 
I'M LIKE MARY KATE, OH, MY GOD! 
[LAUGHTER]
I'M ALL THE SCREAM, YOU KNOW, 
I'M LIKE -- AND SHE'S THERE AND 
I'M THINKING, STAY COOL, STAY 
COOL. 
ANYWAY, SHE GETS HER ---ON-A 
SKINNY LATTE OR SOMETHING SHE 
GOT.
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE BEVERAGE 
SHE GOT.
I'M NOT A STALKER.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, SHE GOT HER BEVERAGE 
AND THE STARBUCKS PERSON SAID 
WHAT NAME WILL I PUT ON THE 
CUP?
I SAID, ARE YOU CRAZY?
IT'S MARY KATE! 
ANYWAY SHE SAID MARY KATE AS 
SHE WOULD.
AND THEN THE STARBUCKS PERSON 
SAYS TO ME AND I ORDER MY 
FRAPPAMOCHA-SOMETHING.
AND HE ASKED ME WHAT NAME TO 
PUT ON AND I SAID CRAIG, AND 
SHE SAID GREG?
EVEN WITH SOME GOOD THINGS, MY 
LIFE KIND OF SUCKS. 
I BRING SUCKINESS WHEREVER I 
GO. 
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S KIND OF 
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE, MY SAYING 
THAT, ISN'T IT? 
LET'S GET ON WITH IT. 
IT'S A VERY BUSY SUMMER SEASON 
RIGHT NOW, ISN'T IT?
IT'S TRAVEL SEASON. 
YES, IT'S TRAVEL SEASON.
SO WHAT WE NEED IS A TRAVEL 
EXPERT. 
PLEASE WELCOME "THE LATE LATE 
SHOW" TRAVEL EXPERT, DAVE 
FOLEY, EVERYBODY! 
[APPLAUSE]
DAVE! 
>> CRAIG! 
CRAIG: DAVE FOLEY.
IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU. 
YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL AND YOU KNOW 
A BIT ABOUT TRAVEL. 
IN FACT WE WERE ON A FLIGHT TO 
LAS VEGAS LAST WEEK.
>> YES, WE WERE.
CRAIG: WHAT'S THE SECRET OF A 
FAMILY VACATION?
>> YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S 
SOMETHING IN IT FOR EVERYONE. 
FOR INSTANCE I SENT MY WIFE TO 
THE SUN MUSEUM. 
AND SO MY VACATION TO LAS VEGAS 
WAS AWESOME.
CRAIG: DIDN'T YOUR WIFE 
COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT?
>> NOT AT ALL.
IF YOU BRING ONE OF THESE WITH 
YOU, SEE HERE?
CRAIG: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CARRYING 
DONOR OR ORGANS, YOU'RE FIRST 
ON THE PLANE, FIRST OFF THE 
PLANE.
CRAIG: DON'T THEY CHECK INSIDE? 
>> YES, THEY DO, AND THAT IS 
WHY WITH A SLICE OF MANGO AND 
SOME FOOD COLORING IS A VERY 
CONVINCING LIVER. 
CAN YOU SEE THAT? 
[LAUGHTER]
AND, THEN ONCE YOU'RE ON THE 
PLANE, YOU'VE GOT A REALLY 
HEALTHY SNACK.
[LAUGHTER]
MMM.
CRAIG: NO, NO.
WHENEVER I TRAVEL, I ALWAYS -- 
I ALWAYS LOSE A PIECE OF 
LUGGAGE.
IS THAT GOOD LIVER? 
>> MANGO. 
CRAIG: IT'S MANGO, OF COURSE. 
WE WOULD NEVER EAT A HUMAN 
LIVER ON TELEVISION.
>> ON HOLIDAY, , HOWEVER. 
CRAIG: WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS 
STAYS IN VEGAS! 
>> YEAH.
CRAIG: YEAH.
WHENEVER I GOT ON A VACATION, I 
ALWAYS SEEM TO LOSE A PIECE OF 
LUGGAGE.
IT'S SUCH A HASSLE. 
HOW CAN I AVOID THAT. 
>> IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A 
HASSLE, BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE A 
PIECE OF YOUR LUGGAGE, IT'S 
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO JUST 
TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S. 
[LAUGHTER]
CRAIG: ISN'T THAT WHAT THE KIDS 
CALL STEALING?
>> NO, CRAIG, NO. 
I LIKE TO CALL IT THE WONDERFUL 
CIRCLE OF LUGGAGE.
CRAIG: THE CIRCLE OF LUGGAGE? 
>> YES, IN FACT EVERYTHING I'M 
WEARING RIGHT NOW WAS TAKEN 
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE'S LUG BEGAN 
I FOUND HERE. 
CRAIG: THAT SOUNDS A BIT GROSS, 
ACTUALLY. 
>> IT'S ACTUALLY FUN, CRAIG, 
BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK AT 
PEOPLE'S STUFF AND TRY TO 
FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE 
THEY ARE. 
FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS SHIRT, I 
FOUND THESE.
SO I CAN ASK MYSELF WHAT KIND 
OF PERSON USES HEART MEDICINE?
[LAUGHTER]
CRAIG: PROBABLY SOMEONE WITH A 
BAD HEART WHO NEEDS THEIR HEART 
MEDICATION. 
>> YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS! 
CRAIG: YEAH!
>> ACTUALLY THIS ONE I FOUND ON 
THE FLIGHT TO VEGAS.
CRAIG: OH, YEAH?
>> I FOUND THIS SO I GOT TO 
WONDER ABOUT THIS.
CAN YOU SEE THAT? 
YOU GOT TO WONDER WHAT KIND A 
PERSON WEARS THIS KIND OF 
LEATHER UNDERWEAR, YOU KNOW, 
THONG?
AND ONE CLUE MIGHT BE, THE 
INITIALS C.F. 
CRAIG: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH 
REGIS PHILBIN, EVERYBODY! 
[APPLAUSE]
DON'T FORGET TO RINSE
THOSE DISHES FIRST.
THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER!
(computer)
YOU DON'T NEED TO RINSE FIRST
WITH ELECTRASOL 3-IN-1 TABS.
THE BLUE LAYER LIFTS STUCK
ON FOOD, THE WHITE CLEANS
TOUGH STAINS, AND THE
JET-DRY POWERBALL MAKES
YOUR DISHES SHINE FOR
100% CLEAN DISHES.
OOH, SPARKLING!
(computer)
ELECTRASOL POWERBALL TABS.
(announcer)
ALSO TRY 2-IN-1
ELECTRASOL GELPACS.
THE ONLY PAC WITH 100%
FAST DISSOLVING GEL, PLUS
JET-DRY RINSE AGENT ACTION

[APPLAUSE]
CRAIG: WELCOME BACK!
WELCOME BACK, MY FRISKY LITTLE 
BADGERS!
[WHIP CRACK]
[LAUGHTER]
MAKE ME DO IT AGAIN!
[WHIP CRACK]
I TOLD YOU! 
[LAUGHTER]
MY FIRST GUEST IS ONE OF THE 
BEST TV HOSTS OF ALL TIME.
HE'S -- HE CO-HOSTS THE TALK 
SHOW JAWINGER NAUT "LIVE WITH 
REGIS AND KELLY." 
AND HE'S ON STAGE.
>> BACKSTAGE GETTING READY. 
AFTER SEEING THIS CROWD, 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TONIGHT.
I SAY AMERICA'S GOT TALENT AND 
I'M STICKING WITH IT.

CRAIG: UH-OH! 
REGIS PHILBIN, EVERYBODY! 
[APPLAUSE]
>> OH, COME ON! 
CRAIG: REEGE! 
REGIS!
I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU!
I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER TO 
SEE YOU?
>> REALLY?
WHY?
CRAIG: I'M JUST GLAD YOU HAVE 
ANOTHER SIT SHOW. 
>> YOU JUST LIKE HANGING AROUND 
WITH SUCCESS. 
CRAIG: YOU'RE SAVING ANOTHER 
NETWORK, YOU SAVED ABC AND NOW 
YOU'RE SAVING NBC.
AND ANY DAY NOW, CBS WILL BE 
CALLING!
CRAIG: WHEN THIS WHOLE KATIE 
COURIC THING COMES ABOUT, YOU 
CAN DO THE NEWS.
THE NEWS WITH REGIS PHILBIN.
>> I'VE BEEN HERE THREE OR FOUR 
TIMES OR SO, BUT WHEN I HIT THE 
FRONT DOOR, I THINK I TALKING 
LIKE HIM. 
CRAIG: YOU ARE NOT TALKING LIKE 
ME 
YOU ARE TALKING LIKE SOMEBODY 
FROM BENGAL.
>> I AM NOT!
CRAIG: YOU PLAYED A LITTLE CLIP 
OF THE THREE OF MY CONTESTANTS. 
>> 
CRAIG: YES, IT'S AN AMAZING 
SHOW. 
>> AND APPARENTLY SOMEBODY SAID 
N YOU INTRODUCE ME, HE LOOKS 
LIKE A LOVELY LAD.
THE MALE SIPPER RIGHT THERE, 
YES.
THERE HE IS.
HE EVEN AUTOGRAPHED THE 
PICTURE.
WHAT DOES IT SAY? 
>> IT SAYS -- 
CRAIG: IT SAYS, CRAIG, CAN'T 
WAIT TO MEET YOU. 
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO.
I'LL HANG ON TO THAT, REEGE.
I'LL PUT IT RIGHT DOWN HERE.
I'LL PUT IT IN THE TRASH. 
NO, IT'S FINE.
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING. 
INCIDENTALLY YOU WERE A BIG HIT 
ON -- 
CRAIG: IT'S NOT KELLY NOW.
>> SPEAKING OF KELLY, OH, YOU 
TWO TOGETHER. 
CRAIG: WHEN I WAS GUST HOS ON 
YOUR SHOW, WHAT WERE YOU OFF 
SAVING SOME OTHER NETWORK?
SO I WAS GUEST HOST AND WHEN I 
WAS WORKING WITH HER, SHE IS A 
PISTOL, ISN'T SHE?
>> ISN'T SHE SOMETHING? 
CRAIG: SHE SURE IS. 
WE HAVE THIS LITTLE THING 
COMING OUT AT THE END, REGIS & 
-- BUT LOOK, SHE CANNOT STOP 
DOING THOSE FACES.
CRAIG: THAT'S KIND OF THE SAME. 
>> REGIS STAYS THE SAME EVERY 
TIME. 
AND THERE SHE IS AGAIN. 
CRAIG: WOW, LOOK AT THAT ONE. 
BUT SHE'S --
>> SHE LIKED YOU A LOT. 
CRAIG: SHE'S VERY EASY TO GET 
ALONG WITH. 
>> DO YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH 
YOUR CO-HERSELF?
CRAIG: WHAT IS THAT MACHI 
BEHIND THERE. 
YOU MESSED WITH THAT AND THEN 
YOU JUMPED. 
WHAT, YOU MEAN- 
[WHIP CRACK]
THAT ONE? 
OR YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO, 
REGIS, STAY RIGHT THERE.
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING]
>> THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA AND YOU 
TAKE PHONE CALLS AND YOU DO 
EMAILS? 
CRAIG: WHERE AM I GOING TO TAKE 
PHONE CALLS?
>> I THOUGHT I SAW A PHONE 
HERE. 
CRAIG: IT'S THE THREE STOOGES, 
THEY WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
>> EMAILS YOU TAKE? 
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE 
CRAIG: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT 
GOING ON. 
>> I KNOW YOU DO. 
CRAIG: YOU TOLD ME THIS.
I SAID TO YOU -- WHEN I FIRST 
GOT THIS JOB, I SAID HOW DO YOU 
MANAGE TO TALK EVERY DAY ABOUT 
JUST ANYTHING?
AND YOU SAID, I CAN'T AFFORD 
WRITERS.
>> I HAVE NO WRITERS, YES.
CRAIG: AND YOU HAVE BEEN DOING 
THIS FOR YEARS? 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING 
THIS? 
>> SINCE MY FIRST SHOW IN 
HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA, 45 
YEARS.
CRAIG: THAT'S SENSATIONAL.
IT REALLY IS SENSATIONAL. 
>> I LOVE IT. 
CRAIG: DO YOU STILL ENJOY IT AS 
MUCH? 
>> THAT 22 MINUTES THAT WE DO 
ALONE UP THERE MEANS EVERYTHING 
TO ME.
WE'RE UNSENSORED, WE'RE 
SPONTANEOUS, IT'S LIVE, IT 
HASN'T BEEN WRITTEN, WE'RE 
MAKING IT UP AS WE GO ALONG.
CRAIG: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT 
THAT'S LIKE.
>> BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN 
SYNC WITH SOMEBODY ELSE, IT 
REALLY IS GREAT.
CRAIG: DOES SHE EVER SAY SHE'S 
TIRED, SHE NEEDS TO RELAX?
>> HOW DO YOU GET YOURSELF UP 
WHEN YOU COME OUT HERE TO DO 
THE SHOW. 
YOU HAVE A HANGOVER, YOU'RE NOT 
FEELING WELL? 
WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET YOURSELF 
UP? 
CRAIG: I TAKE STIMULANTS. 
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE A BASEBALL PLAYER COME 
AROUND AND INJECT ME WITH 
SOMETHING.
STEROIDS. 
>> VERY FUNNY.
CRAIG: YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO DO 
WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. 
>> YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT 
TO DO.
CRAIG: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH 
REGIS PHILBIN, EVERYBODY! 
[APPLAUSE]
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
ALL SHAVING GELS
AND SHAVING CREAMS WERE ALIKE,
BUT SINCE I STARTED USING NEW
EDGE ACTIVE CARE SHAVING CREAM,
I REALIZE...
WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN.
OKAY, MAYBE FOOL
IS A STRONG WORD,
BUT EDGE ACTIVE CARE
HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE
IN THE LOOK AND FEEL OF MY SKIN.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
(announcer)
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT, IT
FEELS DIFFERENT.
IT IS DIFFERENT...
AQUAFRESH EXTREME CLEAN.
IT'S UNIQUE MICRO-ACTIVE
FOAM KILLS BAD BREATH GERMS
THEN LEAVES A FRESH, TINGLING
THAT JUST WON'T QUIT!
AQUAFRESH EXTREME CLEAN.
IT HAD TO BE YOU 
I WANDERED AROUND 
AND FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE 
WHO 
COULD MAKE ME BE TRUE 
[APPLAUSE]
CRAIG: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! 
REICE, ARE YOU DATEDING JACK 
NICHOLSON?
>> ONE NIGHT WE HAD A 5 1/2 
HOUR DATE.
IT WAS GREAT. 
JACK NICHOLSON. 
CRAIG: I'M SCARED OF JACK 
NICHOLSON.
>> HE'S QUITE A CHARACTER.
AND FOR SOME REASON WE WENT TO 
A BASKETBALL GAME TOGETHER. 
AND THIS WAS A LOT OF FUN.
CRAIG: HOW DO YOU GET TO HANG 
WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE?
>> GEORGE CLOONEY DURING MY 
VACATION STOPPED BY GEORGE'S 
HOUSE.
CRAIG: YOU WENT BY HIS HOUSE? 
>> ATE PIZZA WITH HIM.
IT WAS GREAT. 
THEY ALL WANT TO HANG AROUND 
WITH HIM. 
CRAIG: AREN'T YOU IN THE BOOK 
OF RECORDS FOR BEING -- 
>> LAST WEEK I WAS PUT INTO THE 
TV HALL OF FAME.
CRAIG: CONGRATULATIONS! 
>> WHAT ELSE CAN GO ON? 
HAVE YOU BEEN TO LAKE CUOMO IN 
ITALY?
CRAIG: TO.
>> BEAUTIFUL LAKE THERE AND WE 
SAID AT THE VERSACI MAGS. 
-- MANSION. 
IT'S AMAZING. 
MY WIFE SAID TO ME -- 
CRAIG: LOVELY WOMAN, JOY. 
>> SOME NIGHTS BETTER THAN 
OTHERS. 
CRAIG: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN 
MARRIED TO JOY? 
>> 36.
CRAIG: 36 YEARS?
IN SHOW BUSINESS, THAT'S A 
LIFETIME. 
THAT'S A LONG TIME IF YOU'RE 
NOT IN SHOW BUSINESS. 
HOW DID YOU KEEP THE MAGIC 
ALIVE?
>> BECAUSE SHE'S GREAT. 
ANYWAY, SO -- 
CRAIG: A RIGHT, YEAH. 
SO NOW WE'RE BACK TO YOU. 
>> ENOUGH ABOUT JOY.
CRAIG: AND YOUR FABULOUS LIFE.
LAKE CUOMO AND GEORGE IS THERE 
-- 
>> WE'RE HAVING DINNER WITH 
DONATELLI VERSACI AND I CAN'T 
GET MY EYES OFF HER HAIR. 
IN FACT I DID TO DONATELLI, I 
HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A 
MODEL.
ALL THE DESIGNS BEGIN WITH A 
SKETCH. 
SO SHE MADE A SKETCH OF ME -- 
CRAIG: I WAS JUST THINKING 
ABOUT YOU BEING A MODEL.
YOU'RE A GOOD-LOOKING MAN.
>> SHE SKETCHED ME AND HERE IT 
IS. 
LOOK AT MY NECK.
MY NECK'S ABOUT 16 INCHES LONG. 
AND I GOT A LITTLE BODY HAIR 
THERE.
CRAIG: DID YOU JUST CALL FOR A 
SHOT ON MY SHOW?
>> I FINALLY GOT 1:03 LEFT, I 
GOT TO GET IT ON. 
CRAIG: DON'T GO BY THE CLOCKS.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T JUST WALLACE IN HERE 
AND -- -- WALLS IN HERE AND SAY 
--
>> I SAID THE CONCIERGE THAT I 
WOULD LIKE ONE OF THOSE LUSTY

COME ON 
COME ON 
JUST CLAP YOUR HANDS TO THE 
BEAT LIKE THIS 
IT AIN'T NOTHING BUT A 
BETTER, Y'ALL 








[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]
CRAIG: WELCOME BACK!
WELCOME BACK, MY HAPPY LITTLE 
BADGERS!
COME ON, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM 
ME? 
IT'S GETTING LATE.
THE NEXT GUEST IS ON "ANIMAL 
HOUSE." 
HE'S GOT A NEW D.V.D. COMING 
OUT.
IT'S IN THE MASTERS OF HORROR 
SERIES. 
IT'S CALLED "DEER WOMAN." 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CLIP. 
>> POLICE!
POLICE, DON'T YOU MOVE!

CRAIG: I THINK I KNOW THAT 
GIRL. 
[LAUGHTER]
PLEASE WELCOME JOHN LANDIS, 
EVERYBODY!
[APPLAUSE]
JOHN LANDIS, YES, ENJOY THE 
CHAIR.
>> THIS IS LIKE A TRICK CHAIR.
CRAIG: A TRICK CHAIR. 
AND THROUGHOUT THE EVENING, 
YOU'LL JUST GO LOWER AND LOWER. 
AND A GIANT DEER COMES IN AND 
WILL MAUL YOU.
DOES THIS WOMAN TURN INTO A 
DEER? 
OR DOES SHE JUST KNOW DEER? 
>> THE DEER WOMAN IS A NATIVE 
AMERICAN MYTH LOGICAL FIGURE. 
WHO'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN UP 
ABOVE WHO FROM THE WAIST DOWN 
IS A DEER.
SHE'S A SUCUBIST. 
CRAIG: I DO KNOW THIS WOMAN.
>> AND SHE'S PLAYED IN THE FILM 
BY THE VERY GORGEOUS CYNTHIA MO 
RA. 
SHE'S A MODEL AND WELL WORTH 
SEEING THE VIDEO FOR. 
THEY BLEEPED OUT THE DIALOGUE 
AND IT MAKES NO SENSE.
CRAIG: THAT'S THE WHOLE SHOW 
RIGHT THERE.
IF YOU START MAKING SENSE, IT'S 
GOING TO MAKE THE REST OF US 
LOOK BAD. 
MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME IS "THE 
AMERICAN WEAR WOLF" IN LONDON" 
FANTASTIC FILM. 
>> I MET MR. FERGUSON, YEARS 
AGO WE HAD LUNCH AND YOU TOLD 
ME YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL 
TIME WAS "THREE AMIGOS."
CRAIG: NO, NO, NO.
DON'T YOU TELL ME.
I'M THE ONE THAT WEARS THE 
BASEBALL CAP BACKWARDS ON THIS 
SHOW, SON.
I LOVE "THREE AMIGOS."
BUT "THE AMERICAN WWEREWOLF IN 
LONDON."
LIKE "ANIMAL HOUSE" IT BECAME A 
GENERA TYPE.
>> EVERYTHING THAT MAKES MONEY 
IS IMITATED.
SO NO MATTER HOW OUT OF MAIN 
STREAM SOMETHING IS, AS SOON AS 
IT'S A HIT, YOU JUST HAD SNOOP 
DOGG ON WHAT USED TO BE 
CONSIDERED GANGSTA. 
ROCK AND ROLL WAS SATANIC UNTIL 
THEY SAW, HEY, YOU MAKE ONE 
WITH THIS.
SO EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A MOVIE 
THAT'S SUCCESSFUL, YOU ARE 
IMITATED. 
AND I ADMIT, I HAVE MADE SOME 
MOVIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
A LOT OF CRAP THAT GAME 
AFTERWARDS. 
CRAIG: WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?
>> I JUST FINISHED SHOOTING THE 
OTHER "MASTERS OF HORROR."
IT AIRS IN THE U.S. ON 
SHOWTIME.

A PAID PROGRAM SPONSORED BY
NATIONAL RECREATIONAL
PROPERTIES.
Last time,
on Financial Freedom
Discoveries, a group
of young entrepreneurs
started a small company
dedicated to marketing
products designed to
help people
find financial freedom.
Our cameras watched them
undertake the monumental
task of choosing the one
product they will stake
their business on.
We looked at dozens of
products and I think we
finally narrowed it down.
I agree.
I think this
is the product.
I think we need
to go forward.
Okay.
I just think that we have
to be a hundred percent
sure that the product
we select works.
And the winner
of their search?
A real estate course which
claims to turn $10 into
$10,000 in 30
days or less.
It's very easy to follow.
You do step A, and then do
you step B, and then you
do step C, and before you
know it you've got money
in your pocket.
Yeah, it's great.
Really, anyone
can do this.
It's extremely simple.
And the originator
of this program?
Dwan Bent-Twyford,
a former waitress and
single mom with no higher
education who started with
just $75 and became a
multi-millionaire by
developing a program so
simply it's astonishing.
It's so simple it
makes you
think that it wont work.
I was actually amazed.
You both understand that
we have to make sure that
this product works,
a hundred percent.
This small company will
stick their reputation on
the product they select
so they must be sure all
claims are true.
I'm going to teach you how
to take a $10 dollar bill
and turn it into $10,000
cash in 30 days or less.
Absolutely.
Anyone can do it.
One-hundred
percent guaranteed.
Guaranteed.
I made almost
$23,000 on that deal.
I made $10 grand
in about a week.
$16,813.
Over $18,000.
$35,000.
$40,000.
$60,000.
$35,000.
Anybody without a real
estate license, without
any formal education,
without any background in
real estate can truly
turn $10 into $10,000 in
30 days.
Anybody can do this.
Anybody.
I can teach absolutely
anybody, anybody, how to
turn $10 into $10,000
in 30 days or less.
Stay tuned for the
most scrutinized
promise on TV today.
Do you dream there's
more to life
then making ends meet?
Do you feel your life
is worth so much more?
Take your first steps
towards financial freedom
today and buy
back your time.
Time for yourself and time
for your family to live
the life you deserve.
My family is more
important
to me than anything.
This has let me be that
person that I always
wanted to be.
Welcome to Financial
Freedom Discoveries.
The show that examines
products designed to
create financial freedom
and puts them to the test.
The responsibility for
researching this program
has fallen to
founder partner,
Lisa Eisenpresser.
We'll follow Lisa and her
behind the scenes camera
across the country as she
captures what people say
in their most
unguarded moments.
The first on was
$17,300 something.
This program is just
as simple as it says.
You're a fortunate young
lady because you've
become involved with
Dwan and her program.
And that's the
way to success.
Will Lisa find this
product to be the perfect
product for her small
company to stand behind?
Is it an easy, no risk
real estate program that's
so unique any
one can do it?
Let's listen in on this
private company meeting.
It's very different
than anything
I've seen out there.
I mean, I think that's
why we narrowed
it down to this.
It's simple, it's
straight forward,
step by step.
Anybody can do this.
I sold Tupperware
for 25 years.
I'm a high school
math teacher.
I spent 20 years
as a paramedic.
I came out of the
corporate world.
I was working at
a grocery store.
I'm a stay at home mom.
I work for the
phone company.
If you follow this step by
step you can't miss.
And she does take you step by
step where you know what
to do on week 1,
week 2, week 3.
Very user friendly.
Step by step instructions.
I've always thought that
the program was the best
program that I've
seen on the market.
Everything is just
laid out for you.
What to do next, what to
expect, what not to do.
All that's in there.
Whether it a slow market
or a hot market
it works everywhere.
Well, I really like Dwan.
She's one of the leading
real estate investors.
She's a woman.
You don't see women
out there
doing this type of thing.
She started from nothing.
She created this system.
My program is for
people with no money.
People with no experience.
No real estate education.
No real estate
background.
You can read this program.
You can do exactly what
it says and you can
absolutely become
a millionaire.
Absolutely.
There's no credit
background in real estate
that's needed.
You don't need a license,
or to go to school, or to
know what all
the terms mean.
I had zero knowledge
in real estate.
I don't need to have
any of my own money.
I don't need
to have credit.
You don't have to worry
about money or credit.
You can have bad credit.
It can be horrible credit
because you're not going
to be purchasing.
No liability.
I didn't have to
put it in my name.
I didn't have to
buy insurances.
I didn't have
to do anything.
You don't have to know
how to rehab or how to
take care of
fixing up a home.
You can make your
million dollars.
I can be dead broke with
$10 in my pocket
and make $10,000.
When I deal with Dwan
you're dealing with people
that are ethical.
Honest, honorable.
She's a tremendous woman.
She's really not doing
this just for the money.
She's actually making a
difference in the world.
Exactly.
That we can really prove
that this program works.
We can really help people.
I'd heard only the
highest praise for Dwan
so it was time for me to
fly to Florida to learn
how her story began.
Like many women she
suddenly found herself
faced with a life
challenging situation.
One day I was married.
One day I wasn't.
I really had an 8 month
old child and no car.
I had my $75, I think, in
my purse and I thought,
"What am I going to do?"
So I start trying to find
something were I could
work for myself and
keep her with me.
So I though, okay, fix up
a house, you sell it, how
hard could that be?
I'll try that.
I was fortunate that I
could borrow money from
family members and
I bought my first
fixer-upper.
Worse case scenario, if
this doesn't work out, I
just go back to
waiting tables.
I mean, I can always
get fired from another
waitress job.
I would go to the houses
with her and
I would help her paint.
You know I'd be painting
those walls, and you know
hammering that thing.
After a huge learning
curve of trial and error I
finally developed a real
estate program that saved
me and my back from
fixing up houses.
I didn't have
to get dirty.
This might be better.
My income just went
through the roof.
I went from waitress
to multi-millionaire.
She worked very
hard for it.
Then people started
asking me to teach.
So I think people were
intrigued by the fact that
I was doing more business
then pretty much all the
men put together.
And they thought wow,
what is this girl doing.
She's going something.
You know, I need to find
out what she's doing.
Now it's years before
you're really doing
everything the right way.
I though, you know it'd
be nice to teach other
people how to do it right
out of gate and not make
any mistakes.
I feel very
motivated when
I watch her speak publicly.
You want to know
how to make money?
Yeah.
Good.
Can you really turn $10
into $10,000
in 30 days or less?
Folks, I'm here to
tell you
it can absolutely be done.
You get paid for
coordinating a transaction.
Can you actually
make $10,000
on one single transaction?
That is actually
an understatement.
I have students who have
made upwards of $100,000
on one simple transaction.
In our first deal we
turned $10 into $20,000.
I've made almost
$23,000 on the deal.
$40,000.
$45,000,
$60,000.
I'd say the best payday
we ever had was $85,000.
I know for a fact that
Dwan actually goes out
there and does, step by
step, what she's telling
everyone else to do.
I think that's incredible.
She's not keeping little
secrets away from you.
She's giving you all the
information because she
wants you to
be successful.
You read it, you walk
straight into success.
I could definitely retire
by the time I'm 30.
I couldn't believe how
easy it was to make it.
That's when I got hooked.
Twelve hours work is
approximately $73,000.
That's $8,000 an hour.
It's a great finder's
fee, isn't it.
Do what you love and
love what you earn with
Dwan's Millionaire
Mindset collection.

30 days or less with this
simple, no risk way to

But, wow, call in the next
20 minutes and we'll make
a payment for you.
Don't miss out.
Get into the Millionaire
Mindset and call now.
I'm a stay at home mom.
I home school
our 2 children.
I do photography
professionally.
And I did some work for
Dwan, photographing her
for the cover
of her book.
The next thing I know
Dwan handed me one of the
books and said here
keep this and read this.
And.
Yeah, but you
know what he did?
He threw it on the side
of his desk and said,
"Whatever".
And then I went
by his studio.
It was like, well this
is very interesting.
I read the book and I said
honey you need to read
this book.
We can do this.
Her program really spells
it out real clearly and
it's very easy to read and
very easy to understand.
We should say,
I do the work.
This is our first check
from the
first deal we closed.
Over $18,000.
I really had worked less
than one full day's worth
of work.
Really that's more
than $2,000 per hour.
You know, it may sound
strange, but you know, we
have been praying for 10
years that God would bring
another means
of work for us.
And we just know that
Dwan was the answer to
our prayers.
So if this package is
our choice to market to
America let's think of
some ways that we can
really test it.
Well, I think one of the
most important thing we do
it that we've go to take
this product to real people.
They could video tape
themselves doing it.
Oh, I love that idea.
I mean, there's
no better test.
At the very beginning I
didn't believe I could do
it, but I just
kept pursuing it.
And, Walla.
It's like walking
up the steps.
You have to do one
step at a time.
Once you figure it out
then you can just repeat
it, and repeat
it, and repeat it.
And the first check that
I received was $26,000.
It was like a Yahoo!
Sign me up.
Being able to give back
to other people and being
able to provide for
yourself and have a
lifestyle that you create.
You can't put a
price on that.
My mission in life.
Don't leave
home without it.
Following the course
step by step I did it.
The biggest payday I
had was about $45,000.
So it's not a
bad weeks work.
I started out with
Dwan's program.
I was a little skeptical.
And I was nervous.
I don't have a very
high education.
In fact, I'm a 9th
grade drop out.
It wasn't as hard as I
thought when I did it step
by step.
Walked away with checks,
$20,000; $40,000; $60,000
without taking my money
to the closing table.
Now what can be
better than that?
After watching Steven's
home video I couldn't wait
to talk to him in person
so I caught up with him
near his home in
South Florida.
I wouldn't feel good
about selling something
unless it really worked.
It does work.
It's ethical.
Which is really
important to me.
Now you're going to give
me your promise that this
is all you need?
That is correct.
It does work.
This does really work.
All you have to do
is go out and start.
It's not brain surgery.
I have a high school
education and was lucky to
get through that.
All you have to have is
the knowledge that I'm
going to give you.
I'm going to give you
a step by step guide to
teach you how to find
distressed properties.
Just by using
a $10 deposit.
And I'm gonna show you in
one easy step how to have
more buyers than you'll
ever know what to do with.
You're getting
paid for
coordinating a transaction.
And you collect very big
checks for doing that.
I personally saw copies
of actually check totals
really earned by people
who used just $10 and
Dwan's course.
If you invest in the
knowledge and you believe
you will achieve.
My skepticism started to
fade, but I still had some
questions so I drove
into the beautiful Rocky
Mountains, high above
Denver, where Dwan has
another home and office.
I wanted to spend the day
with Dwan
and meet her family.
This is my Million Dollar
motivation right here.
I spent 13 years
as a single mom.
And I thought, you know,
I am never gonna marry a
real estate investor.
Till she met me.
I married a real
estate investor.
And he came with
2 kids of his own.
Everything is great now.
I love being
in this family.
They're learning all of
this stuff so they can go
out and do deals.
We're working on
our first deal now.
I'm 16 and I gonna be
doing my first deal.
And I'm 13 and
in the 8th grade.
The whole business
is just awesome.
And I love it.
I enjoy it.
Like, every kid at my
age should have the
opportunity that I have.
We're definitely creating
a life instead of
creating a living.
We could be on the beach
in Cancun
and be making money.
I spend time where I want.
I spend my days as I want.
And I have the quality
time with my family.
There are only a few hours
involved in just putting
one transaction together.
You'll only be
working, really,
4-5-6-10 hours a week.
And you'll be making way,
way more than full time money.
3, 4, 5 hours,
you know, tops.
It took about 4 hours
and we made $16,813.
I worked less than a full
day's worth of work and I
made over $18,000.
I take 4 to 5 hours
work, if that much.
I made $15,000 and
everybody was happy.
The job I had was paying
about $26,000 in a year.
I made $10 grand
in about a week.
I was so happy that
I quit the job.
Most people will want to
quit their regular job
when they're making more
part-time then they are on
their normal job.
And that doesn't
take very long.
I'm talking about
weeks and months.
I actually got to quit my
job after my second deal.
I don't want to go
back to having a job.
Which we know job stands
for Just Over Broke.
I could definitely be a
millionaire
in a year's time.
Someone else who's
more needy
can use my Social Security.
I don't need it.
I don't have to depend
on Social Security.
I can depend on me.
This business
is so much fun.
Hey, I am retired.
We tried to retire.
It just didn't happen.
Social Security
isn't going to do it.
It just opened up
everything to us.
It turned
everything around.
It made life worth living.
It's more enjoyable
without the worry.
I'm much more relaxed and
more pleasant to be with,
my darling right?
Right.
You bet.
Because money is coming
in instead of going out.
You make $38,000 in one
month, you know, you can't
worry too much
about money anymore.
It's an ideal
lifestyle for us.
We're going to go forever.
I married by high
school sweetheart.
I was widowed at 25.
I jumped into this
business really with the
mindset that I have
nothing else to lose and
nothing else to live for
if I don't create it.
If your husband dies are
you going
to lose your house?
Are you going to
be able to
financially support yourself.
I didn't have to worry
about any of that.
I know I can
support myself.
If you're a single mom,
you know, if for some
reason your husband is
injured and can't work.
Then this is something
you can very easily do.
You can do it with the
kids screaming in
the background.
Doesn't take
a lot of time.
You can be a
very busy person.
You can have 2 jobs and
you can still find time.
You're students aren't
getting paid for what they
do they're getting paid
for what they know.
Yeah, they don't actually
do that much work.
So they're getting paid
for what they know.
This is not hard to do.
I was actually amazed
at how easy it was.
One of the things that we
do as humans is we try to
make things a lot more
complicated then they need
to be.
For anyone
who's listening.
I want you to know that
you can make your dreams
come true.
Get the course.
Listen to it.
And then you take
it into your heart.
You take it into your
mind and just do it.
It's the moment you
start changing your life.
If a Hispanic girl, you
know, who came from a pour
background can do it
you can do it too.
Do what you love and love
what you earn with Dwan's

And typically it's not
my time and effort that I
really get paid for.
It's the education that
I've received that allows
me to do that.
It's the old thing, pay me
for what I know, not what
I do.
Younger people, it's a
fantastic opportunity.
Any age.
I'd hate to tell
you how old w. are.
And I only have a
high school education.
I got a GED.
I don't have college.
I home school and I
stay home
and I'm able to do it.
Anybody can do this.
Really simple.
Should we tell
them, Gloria?
Go ahead.
We made $38,000.
This is just part of it.
Actually I picked
this check up today.
I'm going to put it in
the bank this afternoon.
We could have another
$6,000
by the end of the month.
So this month I should
be making $50,000.
I had about $50,000
for that month.
My deposits this month
on my real estate is
approximately $73,000.
Because I never had
that kind of money.
You're totally making
me want to do it.
My first one was
$17,300 and something.
Wow.
And that's a real check.
Look at that.
It's fantastic.
I mean, there's absolutely
no reason not to do this,
is there?
No reason at all.
It doesn't cost you
anything but effort.
Not so much effort it
doesn't sound like.
If you listen to what
Dwan tells you,
you can't fail.
I just had more time.
I have more time
to do nothing.
The people have labeled
it a winner, but I still
wanted to ask the experts.
I've never heard of a
lower risk way to get
involved in real estate.
You don't have any.
And you don't have
to be an expert.
You don't have to
have a real estate license.
You can do this
on your own.
And huge profits for
very little money.
It could be dozens
of deals with this.
I mean, that is a good
formula for success.
It's also something that
maybe not everybody is
doing so it's a different
part of the real estate
market that you could,
you know, maybe grab a
nitch of.
How many of you really
want to be where you are
right now, next year?
No.
So, if you take one thing
away with you today I
want it to be the
confidence to know that
you could have
financial freedom.
It's there.
You just have to have
the confidence to do it.
If you just do
it, it's not hard.
I am living the
American Dream.
That is my hope for
everyone in America.
That they will
live the dream.
The way Dwan lives her
dream is help people who
have lost their homes
get on their feet again.
The time I spent in
Denver I happened to
witness Dwan's
charitable giving.
Although she refused to
talk about her good deed
on camera none of us
will ever forget it.
I started this company
with the idea that you can
do well, while doing good.
And it is exactly what
Dwan's philosophy is.
To teach others how to
improve the quality of
their life.
Dwan's program is
probably the best thing
that's happened
to us, except us.
The seed you sow today
is a harvest you reap
tomorrow.
This program has really
made a difference in my
life at how I
look at things.
In doing Dwan's course
you learn how to help people.
Helping somebody else.
And that to me is
a big part of this.
Oh it is so authentic.
One of my favorite parts
about our first deal is
that this guy had
just a terrible story.
And it made us
feel really good.
We're like, we're helping
him and we're helping
ourselves at
the same time.
And it felt really good.
That convinced, more than
ever, that we're on to
something important.
Absolutely.
I mean all we wanted to
find was a product that
would help people.
Do it.
I feel like I can now.
Yeah you can.
After pain-staking efforts
to decide for my small
company if we were going
to market Dwan's program.
I finally made
by decision.
I just wanted to tell
you that, having seen you
speak, you really, really
connect with people
because you come from a
place of authenticity.
I'm just so excited to
do business with you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Dwan's program has helped
us to just be able to
spend more time
as a family.
My family is more
important to me anything.
This has let me be that
person that I always
wanted to be.
I'm finally getting able
to be the person that I
wanted to be.
I got to take my home
family and we went to
Italy.
So we even got to
see the Pope speak.
God meant for my Mom.
Actually, that was
a dream come true.
Time to be with my family.
Time to take
care of my body.
Time to help other people.
Now we give the
Christmas vacation.
Twyears from now they're
not going to remember the
toy they got, but they'll
remember the time with
Grandma and Grandpa.
And that's more precious
to me than anything.
I started off, really,
no money, no education, a
baby, $75, and a very
strong desire to eat.
I want to take that will
and desire that I had for
myself and somehow
transfer it to you so that
you'll go out there and
you'll make a change in
your life and you'll have
the confidence to know
that you too can have as
much financial freedom as
you want to have.
You'll enjoy the kind of
life that you deserve to have.
And all of you deserve
to have a better life.
Now I don't have to live
from paycheck to paycheck.
Oh, the best thing
is not having a boss.
There's not 8 - 10
hour days anymore.
We get up when we want to.
My commute is
about 30 seconds.
I have a lot
less stress now.
I'm not worried
about money.
Turn off the cell phone
and call it my day.
That's financial freedom.
I have a life.
I love what I do.
I am so happy.
We are on the road
to financial freedom.
I don't have a 9-5.
I'm free.
They really do embody
the idea that financial
freedom is available and
it's not that hard to grab
a hold of.
Because it's not.
We'll be in Jamaica today.
We'll be in the Camen
Islands tomorrow swimming
with the sting rays.
Then we'll be in
Mexico on Friday.
And my sexy husband's
sun bathing over there.
Right now, my kids being
silly out there on the raft
doing what they're doing.
But it really is
wonderful to hear.
And the cool thing
is last weekend I was
snowboarding.
So it really is
an amazing life.
The people watching think
that, "Gosh I'd like to be
that person too, but I
just don't
think I can do it."
And that's the beauty
of this course.
It's truly step by step.
Dwan has done a fabulous
job outlining exactly what
to do to be one of
those people on TV.
It's just an amazing way
to make money
in real estate.
Following the right steps
I think the
sky's the limit.
About $4,000 and
some odd an hour.
I got paid more than
$2,000 per hour.
Just anybody out there
that wants to change
they're way of life.
You can have whatever
you want out of life.
Barriers of race, or
creed, or financial
background, or education
can not stop you from
making money.
As long as you can find 2
hours out of the week you
can do this.
You can do it
in any state.
Baltimore, MD.
Michigan.
Texas.
Colorado.
Florida.
California.
New York.
Pennsylvania.
Whether it's a slow market
or a hot market,
it works everywhere.
If you don't take the
chance and try it you'll
never get more than
you've ever gotten.
Our final hurtle is gonna
to be making sure we can
sell this product at a
price that
people can afford.
I life the way that
people talk about Dwan
and her business ethics
and I can only hope that
they'll talk about
me like that.
People that sell programs
sell them for several
thousands of dollars.
As far as putting a price
on it, it would be really
hard for me to do.
If you knew the kind of
money that I was bringing
in right now.
Then 10, 15, $20,000 would
be reasonable to pay for
Dwan's courses.
You'll make it back
the first
transaction you conduct.
Just the first deal alone
I got paid 10 times more
than what I even
paid for the program.
I paid $1500.
The same week
I made $10,000.
So, it didn't
cost me anything.
For the home audience we
want them to feel like
their getting a gift.
And I understand that the
average working person
can't afford $2,000, or
even $1,000, or even $500.
So we'll come way down on
the price, so everyone can
afford it.
And everyone can have
financial freedom.
Hi, I'm Dwan.

investing skills designed
especially for people with

It's far under-priced.
Oh, that's a give away.

so little for something
like this.
I thinks it's great.
I mean, it makes it, it
helps it make it easier
for people to get
involved in this.
That is an awesome deal.
Definite give-away.
It comes with a money
back guarantee so you have
nothing to lose.

broke just 30 days, or 60
days, or 90 days from now.
Or you can buy it and be
on vacation 30 days, and
60 days, and 90
days from now.
It's your choice.
Give a different
lifestyle to your family.
You definitely can do it.
Dig in and get
going and do it.
Anybody can do this.
If it works for a
Tupperware lady it'll work
for anybody.
All they have to do is
just make the decision
that this it.

OF JONBENET'S MOTHER.
ONCE A PRIME SUSPECT
IN HER DAUGHTER'S MURDER, DID
PATSY RAMSEY TAKE SECRETS
TO HER GRAVE?
VICTORIA HAS THE SEGMENT THREE
STORY.
>> WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR PEOPLE
TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE LOVED THIS
CHILD WITH EVERYTHING
IN OUR BEING.
>> Reporter: A GRUESOME MURDER,
A CRIME THAT GRIPPED THE NATION,
AND A MOTHER ACCUSED BY SOME
OF KILLING HER OWN DAUGHTER.
>> DID YOU GET ANGRY AND DID
YOU HURT HER?
>> NO, I DID NOT.
>> WHAT IS YOUR REACTION WHEN
YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE THINK
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID?
>> THEY ARE WRONG.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
HOW ELSE DO YOU SAY, NO, EXCEPT,
NO.
>> Reporter: LOVING MOTHER,
OR MURDER SUSPECT?
PATSY RAMSEY SPENT THE LAST
DECADE OF HER LIFE AS BOTH.
NOW, THE QUESTION IS, DID THIS
FORMER BEAUTY QUEEN TAKE HIDDEN
DETAILS OF JONBENET'S DEATH
TO HER GRAVE?
SO MANY CRIMES IN AMERICA GO
UNSOLVED.
IT WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE
SOLVED.
AND NOW THAT PATSY RAMSEY HAS
DIED, WHATEVER SHE MAY HAVE
KNOWN HAS GONE TO THE GRAVE
WITH HER.
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT WE WILL NEVER LIKELY KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO JONBENET
RAMSEY.
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?
>> WE HAVE A KIDNAPPING.
>> EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING
PLEASE.
ON OKAY?
>> THERE'S A NOTE AND MY
DAUGHTER'S GONE.
>> A NOTE WAS LEFT
IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S ROOM?
>> YES.
>> HOW OLD IS YOUR DAUGHTER?
>> SIX YEARS OLD.
SHE'S BLONDE.
SIX YEARS OLD.
>> HE DIDN'T DO IT.
I DIDN'T DO IT.
BURKE DIDN'T DO IT.
WE LOVED THAT CHILD, OKAY?
WE'RE NOT INVOLVED.
READ MY LIPS.
>> SUCH A TRAGIC LIFE,
ESPECIALLY THE SECOND HALF
OF HER LIFE.
SHE LOST HER DAUGHTER AND INDEED
TO HAVE BEEN UNDER SUSPICION
AT ONE POINT.
NEITHER PATSY OR ANY MEMBER OF
HER FAMILY WERE EVER INDICTED,
AND EVEN AFTER DWRX NA EVIDENCE
EXONERATED THEM IN THE CASE,
WE WILL NEVER KNOW IF PATSY KNEW
SECRETS SHE NEVER REVEALED.
>> SHE WAS ON THE STAIRS.
SHE WASN'T IN HER BED.
SHE'S JUST NOWHERE.
>> Reporter: THE CASE SPAWNED
TWO MADE-FOR-TV MOVIES.
AND MULTIPLE STORIES BY 20/20,
48 HOURS, AND DATELINE.
>> THIS IS A PERFECT PLACE TO GO
IN, IF I WAS A BURGLAR OR
TRYING TO GET INTO A HOUSE.
SOMEONE'S
>> Reporter: BUT 9 1/2 YEARS
AFTER JONBENET'S MURDER, NO ONE
HAS EVER BEEN CHARGED
OR ARRESTED.
WILL PATSY'S DEATH FROM OVARIAN
CANCER REINVIGORATE
THE INVESTIGATION?
>> THAT CASE WILL LIVE ON.
THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO CONTINUE
TO WRITE BOOKS AND ARTICLES,
THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO
INVESTIGATE.
I DON'T THINK THE CASE WILL EVER
DIE.
JONBENET RAMSEY WILL ALWAYS BE
PART OF AMERICAN JUDICIAL
HISTORY.
>> Reporter: PATSY DIDN'T LIVE
TO SEE HER DAUGHTER'S KILLER
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.
HER HUSBAND AND SON WERE
REPORTEDLY BY PATSY'S SIDE WHEN
SHE DIED.
RAMSEY WILL BE BURIED IN A PLOT
NEXT TO JONBENET, TOGETHER,
FOREVER, FOR THE REST OF TIME.
THE SEARCH FOR JONBENET'S KILLER
STILL CONTINUES TODAY.
BUT WE WANT TO KNOW, DO
YOU THINK HER MURDER WILL EVER
BE SOLVED?

IT WAS PERSONAL AND ROMANTIC.
THEY SHARED ENOUGH
WITH THE WORLD AND
WITH THE "INSIDER," OF COURSE,
FOR US TO REVEL IN

ONE OF 25 YEAR OLD
ABRAHAM SHOREY'S
ALLEGED VICTIMS
DESCRIBED HER
ATTACK IN HER
APARTMENT LAST
AUGUST.
SHE SAYS SHE BIT HIS
FINGER.. CREATING THE
D-N-A EVIDENCE THAT
ALLEGEDLY LINKED
SHOREY TO THE CRIME.
25-YEAR-OLD ABRAHAM
SHOREY IS ACCUSED OF
BREAKING INTO THAT
WOMAN'S OCEAN
BEACH HOME LAST
AUGUST... AND TRYING
TO RAPE HER...
INVESTIGATORS SAY HE
ENTERED THE HOME
THROUGH AN
UNLOCKED WINDOW.
SHOREY WAS WANTED
FOR A SERIES OF
ASSAULTS IN ITHICA,
NEW YORK THAT TOOK
PLACE IN 2004 IN AN
AREA NEAR
CORNELL UNIVERSITY
KNOWN AS
COLLEGETOWN.
HE WAS ARRESTED
AND TAKEN INTO
CUSTODY FOR THOSE
CASES... BUT FLED
AFTER POSTING BAIL.
HE HAD BEEN ON THE
RUN.... AND WAS
FEATURED ON THE
TELEVISION SERIES
"AMERICA'S MOST
WANTED"....
BUT RESURFACED LATE
LAST YEAR HERE IN SAN
DIEGO.
NOW A JUDGE IS
RULING HE MUST STAND
TRIAL ON MULTIPLE
COUNTS OF VICTIMIZING
THREE WOMEN AND
ONE MAN.... THE
ALLEGED INCIDENTS ALL
TAKING PLACE LAST
AUGUST IN OCEAN
BEACH.
HE WAS LINKED TO THE
CRIMES BY DNA
EVIDENCE LEFT AT THE
SCENE. IN COURT
YESTERDAY... ONE OF
HIS ALLEGED VICTIMS
TESTIFIED ABOUT THE
INCIDENT WHERE SHE
WOKE UP WITH A MAN
ON TOP OF HER... SHE
SAID SHE FEARED FOR
HER LIFE.
IF CONVICTED... 25 YEAR
OLD ABRAHAM SHOREY
FACES UP TO 18 YEARS
IN PRISON FOR THE
CHARGES HE FACES
HERE IN SAN DIEGO.
SHORE WAS ARRESTED
IN EARLY MAY IN
NORMAL HEIGHTS AND
VOLUNTARILY
PROVIDED A DNA
SAMPLE.
THAT SAMPLE GAVE
INVESTIGATORS THE
KEY.. THEY SAY TO LINK
HIM TO THE CRIMES IN
OCEAN BEACH.
INVESTIGATORS ARE
STILL LOOKING FOR THE
SUSPECT IN AN
EARLY-MORNING
SHOOTING IN SPRING
VALLEY.
THE SHOOTING WAS
REPORTED JUST
BEFORE 2 THIS
MORNING.
IT HAPPENED IN THE
92-HUNDRED BLOCK OF
KENWOOD DRIVE.
A MAN WAS SHOT ONCE
IN THE BACK AND TAKEN
TO SCRIPPS MERCY
HOSPITAL.
HIS CONDITION IS
UNKNOWN.
POLICE HAVE SAID
LITTLE ABOUT THE
SUSPECT THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR, OTHER
THAN THAT HE'S A
BLACK MALE.
THE MAN CONVICTED
OF A DEADLY HIT-AND-
RUN IN CLAIREMONT
LAST SUMMER, WILL BE
BACK IN COURT TODAY.
50-YEAR-OLD ROBIN
BRADY WILL BE

AFTERNOON.
BRADY CONFESSED
LAST MONTH TO
HITTING AND KILLING
19-YEAR-OLD ANGELINA
PADILLA AS SHE
WALKED ALONG
CLAIREMONT MESA
BOULEVARD LAST JULY.
BRADY COULD BE
SENTENCED TO AS
MUCH AS FOUR YEARS
AND EIGHT MONTHS IN
PRISON.
A PAIR OF PROTESTS
ARE PLANNED FOR
LATER TODAY IN VISTA
IN RESPONSE TO A
PROPOSAL THAT

THE PROPOSED

OF VISTA.
A GROUP OF
IMMIGRANT-RIGHTS
SUPPORTERS WILL BE
FORMING A HUMAN
CHAIN TO PROTEST THE
PLAN.
MEANWHILE, THE SAN
DIEGO MINUTEMEN WILL
HOLD A COUNTER-
DEMONSTRATION TO
SUPPORT THE
MEASURE.
PARTY PHOTOS OF

You guys. You mean

ORDERED BY
GOVERNOR
SCHWARZENEGGER.
THE SESSION'S FOCUS
WILL BE TO DEAL WITH

THE MOVE COMES
AFTER A SPECIAL

A FEDERAL JUDGE
CRITICIZED THE

AFTER BEING ACCUSED

WHERE DOES DEPRESSION HURT?
EVERYWHERE.
WHO DOES
DEPRESSION HURT?
EVERYONE.
DID YOU KNOW THAT DEPRESSION
HURTS EMOTIONALLY...
AND PHYSICALLY?
NOT EVERYONE LOOKS
AT DEPRESSION THAT WAY.
CYMBALTA IS A PRESCRIPTION
MEDICATION FOR DEPRESSION...
THAT TREATS BOTH
ITS EMOTIONAL...
AND PAINFUL
PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS.
CYMBALTA WORKS
ON SEROTONIN...
AND NOREPINERINE.
PEOPLE TAKING MAOIs
OR THIORIDAZINE...
OR WHO HAVE
UNCONTROLLED GLAUCOMA...
SHOULD NOT TAKE CYMBALTA.
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
IF YOUR DEPRESSION WORSENS...
OR YOU HAVE THOUGHTS
OF SUICIDE.
ANTIDEPRESSANTS
CAN INCREASE THESE THOUGHTS...
OR BEHAVIORS
IN CHILDREN UNDER 18.
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
IF YOU HAVE LIVER DISEASE...
AND ABOUT
YOUR ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.
SIDE EFFECTS
MAY INCLUDE NAUSEA,
DRY MOUTH
AND CONSTIPATION.
ASK YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT CYMBALTA.
DEPRESSION HURTS.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

I' HARRY SMITH.
GOOD NEWS FOR COFFEE LOVERS.
DRINKING LOTS AND LOTS OF COFFEE
APPEARS TO REDUCE YOUR RISK OF 
DIABETES.
WE'LL HAVE DETAILS ON THAT.
>>> CONGRESS MAY BE GETTING 
READY TO TAKE A SUMMER BREAK BUT
THAT A SNOT TAKING ON HOT BUTTON
ISSUES.
AMY WALTER IS A SENIOR EDITOR OF
THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT.
GOOD MORNING. 
>> GOOD MORNING, HARRY. 
>> I'M READING OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS THERE MAY 
ACTUALLY BE ENOUGH VOTES IN THE 
SENATE THAT THEY COULD PUSH ON A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AGAINST
FLAG BURNING.
IS THAT TRUE?
>> WELL, WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 
BACK AND FORTH ABOUT JUST HOW 
MANY VOTES ARE THERE AND HOW 
MANY DEMOCRATS AND HOW MANY 
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE ON 
THE BILL, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS
IT'S TRUE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE 
THAT WHILE IT IS NOT SORRY FOR 
THE PUN A BURNING ISSUE FOR MOST
VOTERS, IT IS CERTAINLY TAKING A
LOT OF ATTENTION. 
>> I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THIS.
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE I READ IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IN THE 
ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC 
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN 200 
DOCUMENTED SERIOUS INCIDENTS OF 
THIS IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
>> YEAH. 
>> YET WE SHOULD BE CHASING 
AFTER A CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT.
THAT'S BIG STUFF. 
>> YEAH, NO, YOU'RE HITTING 
RIGHT ON IT, HARRY, WHICH IS WHY
THIS ISSUE, WHY NOW?
CERTAINLY, THE FOCUS ON THIS 
ISSUE DOES HAVE MUCH MORE TO DO,
I THINK, WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING 
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTTIONS THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE.
MIDTERM ELECTTIONS ARE GENERALLY
LOW TURNOUT AFFAIRS.
THEY ARE NOT RUINING VOTERS 
NECESSARILY AND GETTING YOUR 
MOTIVATED VOTERS OUT TO VOTE AND
KEEPING THEM MOTIVATED AND 
MAKING SURE YOUR FOLKS ARE READY
TO GO.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT
REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING IT'S 
GOING TO HELP KEEP THEIR BASE, 
THE FOLKS THEY FEAR RIGHT NOW 
ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS COMING 
OUT AS DEMOCRATS ARE READY TO 
GO. 
>> PRESIDENT BUSH'S BIGGEST 
LOSSES OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO
IS HIS POLL NUMBERS HAVE GONE 
DOWN IS WITH INDEPENDENCE AND 
MORE MODERATE REPUBLICANS, SO IS
A LOT OF THIS ALL ABOUT 
SOLIDIFIED YOUR BASE FOR GETTING
READY FOR THE FALL THIS YEAR?
>> THAT'S THE REALLY INTERESTING
POINT.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S
OVERALL APPROVAL RATING SLIPPAGE
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, YES, A
LOT OF IT HAS BEEN AMONG 
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS.
THERE IS THIS OUTCRY IN 
WASHINGTON, BOY, THE PRESIDENT 
IS LOSING SUPPORT FROM 
CONSERVATIVES AND THAT'S WHY THE
FOCUS ON ISSUES LIKE THE GAY 
MARRIAGE BAN OR FLAG BURNING.
BUT WHEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU 
LOOK AT THE GALLUP POLL WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT LOST MOST OF HIS 
SUPPORT THIS SPRING WAS AMONG 
LIBERAL AND ON MODERATE 
SELF-DESCRIBED REPUBLICANS.
NOT AMONG CONSERVATIVES. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THE WORRY, OF COURSE, IS YOU 
PUSH SOMETHING THAT ONCE -- ONE 
PARTY OR PARTY, THE MORE 
CONSERVATIVE SIDE REALLY LIKES 
AT THE EXPENSE OF MORE MODERATE 
VOTERS. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT MAD
AS HECK AT THE "THE NEW YORK 
TIMES."
THERE ARE OTHER PAPERS INCLUDING
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" ABOUT 
REVEALING THE BANK'S 
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM.
IS THIS A WAY TO ATTACK THE EVIL
MEDIA OR IS THERE A LEGITIMATE 
BEEF HERE IN 30 SECONDS OR SO?
>> RIGHT.
WELL, LISTEN, I THINK THAT 
CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT GOING ON
THE OFFENSE ON TERRORISM IS 
ALWAYS A PLACE WHERE HE FEELS 
THE MOST COMFORTABLE, THE MOST 
CONFIDENT, AND IT IS STILL THE 
PLACE WHERE MOST AMERICANS GIVE 
HIM HIGH MARKS.
SO FOR THE PRESIDENT TO GO OUT 
ON THE OFFENSE ON THIS ISSUE, I 
THINK, STILL HELPS HIM 
ULTIMATELY IN PUSHING HIS GOAL 
TOWARD OF POSITIONING HIMSELF 
AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ON 
TERRORISM AS THE LEADERS AND 
PROTECTORS. 
>> YEAH, EASY TARGET.
AMY WALTERS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GREAT TO SEE YOU. 
>> THANKS, HARRY. 
>>> STILL TO COME, A TEXAS 
FAMILY TAKES A HUGE STEP TOWARDS
ERASING THEIR DEBT IN OUR MONEY 
MAKEOVER.
WE'LL TELL YOU HOW YOU CAN DO 
THE SAME.

>>> THIS MORNING ON 
"HEALTHWATCH" A GOOD REASON TO 
REACH FOR THE EXTRA CUP OF 
COFFEE.
A REPORT FINDS NEW HEALTH 
BENEFITS RELATED TO DIABETES IF 
YOU DRINK A LOT OF COFFEE.
DR. EMILY SENAY IS HERE WITH THE
LATEST.
WHAT DOES THE STUDY SAY EXACTLY?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IN THE IT'S 
GOOD FOR YOU, BAD FOR YOU.
THIS MORNING, IT'S?
>> GOOD FOR YOU. 
>> RIGHT!
>> BECAUSE ALL WE DO -- THEY DO 
COFFEE STUDIES EVERY OTHER WEEK 
I THINK. 
>> THEY DO.
IT'S A REALLY POPULAR DRINK.
IT'S SUCH A BIG PART OF THE 
AMERICAN DIET.
THIS STUDY WAS 28,000 WOMEN IN 
IOWA.
POST MENOPAUSAL WOMEN FOLLOWED 
THESE WOMEN FOR A 11 YEARS.
DURING THAT TIME THEY ASKED THEM
PERIODICALLY ABOUT WHAT THEY ATE
AND WHAT THEY DRANK.
AT THE END OF THE 11 YEARS THEY 
CALCULATED WHO GOT DIABETES, WHO
DIDN'T AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT 
WHO DRANK COFFEE AND WHO DIDN'T,
HOW MUCH COFFEE THEY DRANK.
THEY FOUND WOMEN WHO DRANK SIX 
CUPS OR MORE OF REGULAR COFFEE 
THAT HAS GOT CAFFEINE IN IT 
REDUCED THEIR RISK BY 22% 
COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO DIDN'T 
DRINK ANY COFFEE.
WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE DECAF 
COFFEE IT REDUCED THE RISK OF 
DEVELOPING TYPE II. 
>> IF YOU ARE SLAMMING DECAP 
COFFEE.
DID IT ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
HOW MUCH THESE PEOPLE WEIGH OR 
WHAT THEIR -- 
>> IT DID.
IT CONTROLLED FOR ALL OF THOSE 
THINGS.
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT BEFORE WE WENT ON THE AIR.
THIS TYPE OF STUDY IS WHAT IS 
KNOWN AS AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY.
THIS IS NOT A RANDOMIZED CONTROL
TRIAL WHERE YOU WOULD GIVE SOME 
WOMEN COFFEE, OTHERS NOT.
THIS IS -- TO GIVE YOU A HINT 
ABOUT EFFECT.
IT'S NOT TO TELL YOU 
DEFINITIVELY THAT DRINKING 
COFFEE WILL REDUCE YOUR RISK OF 
TYPE II DIABETES BECAUSE WE KNOW
THERE ARE MUCH BETTER WAYS TO DO
THAT. 
>> HERE IS WHAT IS DISTURBING TO
ME ABOUT A STUDY LIKE THIS.
I'VE HEARD IT TALK ABOUT 24 
HOURS.
THE LOCAL NEWS STATIONS AND THE 
RADIO SAY YOU DRINK A LOT OF 
COFFEE IT WILL REDUCE YOUR RISK 
OF DIABETES.
THE FACT IS IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING
CARE OF YOURSELF, OBESE, EATING 
FATTY FOODS, IT DOESN'T MATTER 
ABOUT THE COFFEE, DOES IT?
>> PROBABLY NOT.
OF COURSE, CONTROLLING YOUR 
WEIGHT IS GOING TO BE A MUCH 
BETTER WAY TO PREVENT GETTING 
TYPE II DIABETES.
ON THE OTHER HAND, COFFEE IS A 
POPULAR DRINK.
IS THERE SOMETHING INSIDE COFFEE
THAT MIGHT HELP A LITTLE BIT AND
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF STUDIES 
LIKE THIS AND ALSO TO GIVE 
RESEARCHERS A HINT OF WHAT THEY 
MIGHT LOOK AT OR WAYS THEY MIGHT
APPROACH NEW RESEARCH TO HELP 
DEFINE BETTER WAYS TO PREVENT 
DIABETES. 
>> IS THERE SOMETHING IN COFFEE 
THAT COULD BE GOOD FOR YOU?
>> THERE ACTUALLY IS.
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS TRICKY.
COFFEE BEANS THEMSELVES MAY 
CONTAIN COMPOUNDS THAT HELP 
CONTROL METABOLISM WHICH IS THE 
PROBLEM WITH DIABETES.
THERE MAY ALSO BE ANTIOXIDANTS 
INSIDE OF IT AND MINERALS ARE 
HELPFUL.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IN THIS 
STUDY IT WAS THE DECAF SO WE 
KNOW IT'S SOMETHING IN THE BEANS
AND NOT THE CAFFEINE. 
>> WE SHOULD ALL WALK AROUND 
WITH AN IV DRIP OF DECAF COFFEE.
SIX CUPS A DAY IS A LOT. 
>> I THINK YOU THINK THIS STUDY 
IS "FULL OF BEANS"?
>> WELL SAID, EMILY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR MEDICAL 
PERSPECTIVE.

COUPLE OF CHARACTERS, AND THAT 
MIGHT INCLUDE HARRY HIMSELF.

PHILLIPS IS IN LONDON WITH MORE.
GOOD MORNING, MARK.

IT'S ENTICING NEWS FOR CHILDREN 
OF ALL AGES WHO ARE
"HARRY POTTER" FANS.
J.K. ROWLING, THE AUTHOR OF THE 
NOW SIXTH AND SOON TO BE SEVENTH
NOVEL ON "HARRY POTTER" SAYS SHE
IS, IN FACT, THINKING OF KILLING
OFF TWO OF THE MAJOR CHARACTERS 
IN THE BOOK.
THAT, OF COURSE, HAS KEPT PEOPLE
HERE IN GREAT SUSPENSE AS TO WHO
THAT MIGHT BE AND, AS YOU SAY, 
IT MIGHT, IN FACT, BE HARRY 
HIMSELF, ALTHOUGH SHE WON'T 
CONFIRM THAT.
SHE WOULD SAY, THOUGH, SHE IS 
TEMPTED, SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT 
WOULD BE THE END OF THE POTTER 
STORY, AND THERE WOULDN'T BE THE
TEMPTATION OR POSSIBILITY BEYOND
THAT POINT OF SOMEONE ELSE AFTER
SHE WAS GONE CONTINUING THIS

PEOPLE TO RUN OUT TO THE BOOK

THAT WILL BE YET, IF THEY NEED 
IT.

IS IT TRUE THAT SHE ACTUALLY

WHICH ARE A GOOD OPTION.
FOR ME, HE CHOSE A MEDICINE
THAT HELPS LOWER
CHOLESTEROL DIFFERENTLY.
ZETIA.
Announcer: MOST CHOLESTEROL
MEDICINES WORK MAINLY 
WITH THE LIVER.
ZETIA WORKS IN
THE DIGESTIVE TRACT,
AS DO SOME OTHER MEDICINES.
BUT ZETIA IS UNIQUE
IN THE WAY IT HELPS BLOCK
THE ABSORPTION OF CHOLESTEROL
THAT COMES FROM FOOD.
AND ZETIA, ALONG WITH
A HEALTHY DIET,
LOWERED BAD CHOLESTEROL
BY AS MUCH AS 30 POINTS--
THAT'S 18%. 
IT COMPLEMENTS WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING LATELY, 
LIKE EATING HEALTHY
AND EXERCISING.
Announcer: ZETIA MAY NOT
BE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE
WHO HAVE EVER
HAD LIVER PROBLEMS,
ARE NURSING OR PREGNANT
OR MAY BECOME PREGNANT.
YOUR DOCTOR WILL DECIDE
IF ZETIA IS RIGHT FOR YOU.
UNEXPLAINED MUSCLE PAIN
OR WEAKNESS
COULD BE A SIGN OF A RARE
BUT SERIOUS SIDE EFFECT,
AND SHOULD BE REPORTED
TO A DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY.
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDED
TIREDNESS AND STOMACH PAIN.
SO EAT HEALTHY
AND ASK YOUR DOCTOR
IF ZETIA IS RIGHT FOR YOU.
NOW YOU CAN TELL EVERYBODY
THAT A WAITRESS GAVE YOU A TIP.

ZETIA. IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY
TO HELP FIGHT CHOLESTEROL.

>> GOOD MORNING.
HOW ARE YOU GUYS?
>> JUST FINE. 
>> GOOD. 
>> NINA, YOU JUST PAID OFF SOME 
BACK TAXES, RIGHT?
TELL US ABOUT YOUR BIG 
ACCOMPLISHMENT THIS WEEK. 
>> WELL, IT WAS OUR FIRST GOAL 
SINCE WE STARTED THE TOTAL MONEY
MAKEOVER AND IT WAS HARD BECAUSE
IT WAS SUCH A BIG NUMBER TO 
START WITH.
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT 
EASIER TO PAY SOME OF OUR 
SMALLER CREDIT CARDS FIRST, BUT 
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REAL 
ESTATE TAXES MADE IT THE 
PRIORITY.
AND WE HAD HOPED WE WOULD BE 
ABLE TO PAY THOSE OUT OF OUR 
BUDGET JUST EXCESS MONIES FROM 
OUR BUDGET.
BUT AFTER A COUPLE MONTHS WE 
COULD SEE IT WAS STAING -- 
TAKING ALL OF OUR RESOURCES FROM
INCOME JUST TO PAY OUR -- 
MAINTAIN OUR EXPENSES.
SO ABOUT A MONTH AGO, WE STARTED
THINKING OF OTHER ALTERNATIVES 
THAT WE MIGHT COME UP WITH TO 
PAY THOSE TAXES AND REALLY GET 
THE DEBT SNOWBALL GOING.
WE CASHED IN A SMALL WHOLE LIFE 
POLICY THAT BROUGHT US A LITTLE 
OVER $2,000.
AND THEN WE SOLD A THIRD 
VEHICLE.
YESTERDAY, WE WROTE THE CHECK 
AND MAILED IT AND WE ARE PAID UP
ON REAL ESTATE TAXES. 
>> THEY'RE CURRENT COMPLETELY!
WAY TO GO, GUYS!
>> THAT'S FANTASTIC.
YOU HAD IN GREAT TIPS FOR THEM.
THEY SOLD THEIR THIRD FAMILY 
CARD.
THEY CASHED OUT THEIR WHOLE LIFE
POLICY AND THEY ALSO NEGOTIATED 
WITH CREDIT CARD COMPANIES.
THIS CAR, TIM, THIS CAR WAS YOUR
BABY, RIGHT?
YOU HAD WORKED HARD ON THIS 
THIRD FAMILY CAR!
WAS THIS WAS YOUR TRUCK.
WAS IT DIFFICULT TO SELL?
>> WELL, YES AND NO.
I MEAN, IT WASN'T TOO BAD.
I KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING THAT 
NEEDED TO BE DONE.
IT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER. 
>> HOW DOES IT FEEL NOW TO MADE 
THESE SACRIFICES AND HAVE THIS 
$4,000 DEBT OFF YOUR BACK?
TIM?
>> IT FEELS GREAT.
I MEAN, IT'S SOMETHING HANGING 
OVER OUR HEADS FOR A WHILE.
WE HAD BIG RELIEF THAT WE 
FINALLY IT TAKEN CARE OF. 
>> DAVE, YOU HAD SOME OTHER 
CHANGES FOR TIM AND NINA.
THEY WERE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE 
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO, RIGHT?
>> THEY WERE BEHIND ON A LOT OF 
THINGS, CREDIT CARDS AND REAL 
ESTATE TAXES WERE BEHIND.
JUST GETTING THEM UP TO CURRENT 
HAS BEEN THE FIRST BIG STEP.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF 
DOING THE LITTLE THINGS.
WE'VE TALKED, TIM AND NINA -- 
KNEE THAT AND I HAVE TALKED OVER
THE PHONE.
IT'S A MATTER OF INCREMENTAL 
PROGRESS.
MY FAVORITE BOOK IS THE TORTOISE
AND THE HARE.
THE TORTIOUS ALWAYS WINS THE 
RACE. 
>> TIM, YOU GOT A HIGHER PAYING 
JOB.
KNEE THAT GOT A SECOND -- NINA 
GOT A SECOND PART-TIME JOB 
THERE.
YOU BEGAN SELLING IN OF YOUR -- 
SOME OF YOUR ANTIQUE GLASSWARE 
THERE ON EBAY.
HAS IT MADE IT A BIG DIFFERENCE 
TO GET THAT SECOND PART-TIME 
JOB?
>> YES IT HAS.
IT'S BEEN FOR A LOT OF REASONS.
THE EXTRA MONEY IS ABOUT $400 A 
MONTH, BUT THAT'S BIG.
WE DECIDED AHEAD OF TIME THAT WE
WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED PERCENT OF 
THAT MONEY AND PUT IT TOWARD 
DEBT OR ELSE ONCE WE DECIDED TO 
SELL THE TRUCK TOWARD SAVING FOR
ANOTHER CAR.
SO THAT'S BEEN BIG.
BUT IT MADE OUR FAMILY WORK 
TOGETHER.
WITH ME BEING GONE ON FRIDAY 
EVENING AND SATURDAY, THE KIDS 
AND TIM TAKE CARE OF THE GROCERY
SHOPPING AND THE LAUNDRY AND 
SOME OTHER THINGS SO IT'S HELPED
US AS A FAMILY, TOO. 
>> GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR THE WHOLE
FAMILY.
TIM, I UNDERSTAND YOUR TEENAGE 
DAUGHTER HAS EACH GOTTEN A JOB, 
IS THIS TRUE?
SUMMER JOB?
>> YES, SHE HAS A SUMMER JOB 
WORKING FOR A YOUTH CAMP AND 
SHE'S HAVING A PRETTY GOOD TIME.
>> NOW SHE'S PAYING SOME OF HER 
OWN EXPENSES.
TIM, THIS IS A BIG CHANGE FOR 
THE WHOLE FAMILY.
IS IT GOING SLOWER THAN YOU 
THOUGHT OR IS IT EASY TO STAY 
MOTIVATED?
>> WELL, IT IS GOING SLOWER THAN
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD.
SOMETIMES IT'S BEEN A LITTLE 
TROUBLE TO STAY MOTIVATED BUT 
WE'VE MANAGED TO KEEP IT GOING.
>> WHAT IS YOUR BEST ADVICE DO 
YOU THINK, DAVE, FOR PEOPLE WHO 
SEE THAT THIS, BOY, THIS IS A 
LONG PROCESS, INCREMENTAL LITTLE
CHANGES?
>> I THINK THE THEME OF THIS 
WHOLE DISCUSSION THIS MORNING IS
ED McMAHON IS NOT COMIC.
IT'S GOING TO BE INCREMENTAL.
DEVELOP A LONG-TERM GAME PLAN.
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU
GROW UP.
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BE FIVE 
YEARS, 20 YEARS FROM NOW.
IT'S A STEP-BY-STEP THING.
WE WANT TO MICROWAVE EVERYTHING 
BUT PERSONAL FINANCE IS A 
CROCKPOT. 
>> HOW PROUD ARE YOU OF THE TWO?
>> THEY ARE AWESOME.
LACY HAS SHAKEN IT UP AND DONE 
IT LIKE A TROOPER.
EVERYTHING IS GREAT. 
>> WE'RE HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.
WE EXPECT ANOTHER GREAT PROGRESS
REPORT AND GLAD THAT YOU GUYS 
ARE ON YOUR WAY.
TIM AND NINA DAVIS, THANKS. 
>> THANK YOU.
>> YOU, TOO, DAVE RAMSEY.
ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. 
>>> UP NEXT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE 
WHY SUMMER IS A PERFECT TIME TO 
SIP A LITTLE ROSE WINE AND DAVE 
WOULD APPROVE IT BECAUSE IT'S 
VERY COST-EFFECTIVE AS WELL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THEY WOULD ALL HAVE ICE
CREAM AND I WOULD HAVE
A BOTTLE OF WATER.
MY DENTIST TOLD
ME ABOUT SENSODYNE.
IT'S TOOTHPASTE,
IT'S EASY TO USE.
IT'S AN EASY FIX FOR AN
UNCOMFORTABLE PROBLEM.
>>> OUR WINE EXPERT JOSH WESSON 
IS HERE WITH US.
HE IS A CONTRIBUTOR TO "FOOD & 
WINE" MAGAZINE.
HE IS HERE TO HE WILL US WHY 
ROSE IS RED HOT AND HOW TO 
COMPARE IT WITH GREAT SUMMER 
FOODS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
>> I FIRST DISCOVERED ROSE IN 
SOUTH OF FRANCE.
SO GREAT THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
>> IT'S THE OFFICIAL COLOR OF 
SUMMER.
THINK ABOUT IT.
PEOPLE GET PINK, HOT DOGS ARE 
PINK.
THE WINE IS PINK.
WHY NOT?
>> ALL OF THESE PIJS ARE ALL 
REALLY DIFFERENT SHADES OF PINK.
WHAT IS THIS ONE YOU HAVE 
PAIRED?
>> I THOUGHT FIVE ROSES FROM 
FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND 
FIVE DIFFERENT STYLES.
THIS IS FROM GREECE, FROM 
NORTHERN GREECE.
IT'S DRY EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS SO
RICH AND DEEP IN FLAVOR.
IT'S LIGHT AND DRY AND GOES 
BEAUTIFULLY WITH ALL KINDS OF 
SALADS, ESPECIALLY TOMATOES.
A LOVELY CONNECTION. 
>> THIS IS A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT COLOR OF PINK, THOUGH,
FROM THIS FIRST ONE.
WHAT IS THIS ONE?
>> ROSES ARE INCOMPLETELY MADE 
RED WINES.
WINE MAKER CAN CHOOSE TO MAKE IT
AS DARK OR LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE 
IN TERMS OF COLORS.
THIS I FROM FRANCE.
MADE FROM CABERNET.
>> THAT IS SO TERRIFIC.
WE'RE NOT CONFUSING THESE ROSES 
WITH THE STUFF THAT -- YOU'RE 
NOT OLD ENOUGH BUT GUYS IN MY 
AGE CATEGORY USED TO DRINK FROM 
PORTUGAL. 
>> AND THEN YOU PUT A CANDLE IN 
THERE, RIGHT?
OR A WEAPON?
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> THOSE WINES GAVE ROSE A BAD 
NAME BUT ROSE IS A VERY 
DELICIOUS AND MADE ALL OVER THE 
WINE WORLD NOW.
THE KNOCK ON ROSE IS THEY'RE NOT
FOR SERIOUS WINE DRINKERS WHO 
WHO DRINKS WINE TO BE SERIOUS?
NOT YOU, NOT ME.
THIS IS FROM AUSTRALIIAN.
THEY ARE ALWAYS HAPPY BECAUSE 
THEY ARE DRINKING WINE ALL THE 
TIME AND SURROUNDED BY BEACHES 
AND CONSTANTLY DRINKING ROSE.
IT'S A WONDERFUL WINE.
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF 
SWEETNESS BUT IN INTENSE AMOUNT 
OF FRUIT THAT MAKES IT A 
BEAUTIFUL CANDIDATE FOR BARBECUE
FLAVOR. 
>> THAT LOOKS SO GREAT.
WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT COLORS 
SO FAR AND NOW WE FINALLY HAVE 
ONE THAT'S GOT A LITTLE SPARKLE 
IN IT?
>> THIS IS FROM SPAIN.
A SPANISH WINE THAT IS MADE IN A
CHAMPAGNE METHOD BUT BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT FROM CHAMPAGNE IT 
DOESN'T COST A LIEUTENANT.
ALL OF THESE WINES ARE UNDER 
$20.
IT IS INSANELY GOOD WITH GRILL 
FISH. 
>> WHERE IS THIS ONE FROM?
>> THIS IS FROM THE NAPA VALLEY.
SOLOROSA.
THIS IS A LATE HARVEST ROSE 
WHICH IS JENUS WITH EVERYTHING 
YOU CAN PICK ON A FRUIT PLATE, 
BURR YES, CHERRIES, IT'S A 
PERFECT MATCH. 
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT 
DOING A ROSE, YOUR VERY FIRST 
ROSE, OF ALL OF THESE WOULD YOU 
PICK TO SAY I'VE NEVER DONE THIS
BEFORE, WHICH ONE WOULD YOU 
PICK?
>> RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.
NOT TOO SWEET, NOT TOO DRY AND A
WINE THAT GOES WITH EVERYTHING.
IF YOU'RE ON A DESERTED ISLAND 
THIS IS THE WINE YOU WANT.
LET'S TASTE IT. 
>> THERE YOU GO.
JOSH WESS, AS ALWAYS, A GREAT 
PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE. 
>> THANK YOU.

>> Reporter: THE DEATH
OF MEGA-PRODUCER AARON SPELLING
IS LIFTING THE LID ON WHAT COULD
BE ONE UGLY FAMILY FEUD.
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED THE DAY
HE DIED?
AND WHERE WERE HIS CHILDREN?
"E.T." INVESTIGATES.
IT IS A MOMENT THAT USUALLY
DRAWS FAMILIES TOGETHER.
BUT THE DEATH OF AARON SPELLING
APPEARS TO BE PUSHING
HIS SURVIVORS APART.
EVIDENCE OF A RIFT EVEN SEEMED
TO GREET SPELLING'S DEATH,
WITH DAUGHTER TORI
AND HER MOTHER, CANDY, ISSUING
SEPARATE STATEMENTS.
TORI, WHOSE NINE-MONTH
SEPARATION FROM HER FATHER ONLY
ENDED ON JUNE 11th, SAYS, "I AM
GRATEFUL THAT I RECENTLY
THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECONCILE
WITH
WITH MY FATHER, AND MOST
GRATEFUL WE HAD THE CHANCE
TO TELL EACH OTHER WE LOVED ONE
ANOTHER BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY.
IT IS A TRUE BLESSING TO HAVE
HAD A PARENT THAT LOVED ME
UNCONDITIONALLY AND WAS ALWAYS
THERE FOR ME."
IN "US MAGAZINE" TORI BLAMED
HER STRAINED RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER MOTHER FOR KEEPING HER
FROM HER DAD.
SHE WAS IN CANADA WITH HUSBAND
DEAN MCDERMOTT AT THE TIME
OF SPELLING'S DEATH.
HER MOTHER WAS THE ONLY FAMILY
MEMBER AT HIS BEDSIDE.
HER STATEMENT, ISSUED JOINTLY
WITH TORI'S BROTHER RANDY, SAYS,
"OUR EXTREME SADNESS AND GRIEF
IS COMFORTED BY THE OVERWHELMING
NUMBER OF HEARTFELT CALLS
WE HAVE RECEIVED.
WE ARE TRULY GRATEFUL
FOR THE OUTPOURING OF LOVE
AND SYMPATHY."
SAID TO BE
AT THE CENTER OF THE RIFT IS
THE END OF TORI'S MARRIAGE
TO CHARLEY SHANIAN,
AND THE BEGINNING
OF HER MARRIAGE TO McDERMOTT.
NO FAMILY WAS PRESENT
AT THEIR WEDDING, AND HER FATHER
WAS SAID TO BE DISAPPOINTED.
BUT LAST WEEK, TORI'S BROTHER
RANDY ADDRESSED THE RUMORED
FEUD, SAYING, "THE TRUTH IS THAT
WE LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH.
THIS ISN'T 'DYNASTY.' THIS IS
REAL LIFE," AND HE HOPES THAT
THE FOCUS WILL REMAIN
ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
AND IN HOLLYWOOD, WHERE AARON
SPELLING TOUCHED SO MANY PEOPLE
DURING HIS PROLIFIC CAREER,
THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS WAS.
HEATHER LOCKLEAR, STAR OF THREE
SPELLING SHOWS, SAYS, "HE CALLED
ME HIS 'LUCKY PENNY' BUT I AM
THE LUCKY ONE BECAUSE HE GRACED
ME WITH HIS ENCOURAGEMENT
AND TALENT."
FORMER CHARLEY'S ANGEL "JACLYN
SMITH" CALLED HER ONE-TIME BOSS
"A DEAR FRIEND AND A TRULY
GENUINE HUMAN BEING."
AND AT SATURDAY'S PREMIERE
OF "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN:
DEAD MAN'S CHEST," SPELLING'S
CONTRIBUTIONS WERE CELEBRATED
BY ALL.
>> AARON SPELLING WAS ONE
OF THE CLASSIEST, MOST ELEGANT,
MOST KIND PRODUCERS/PEOPLE I'VE
EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK
FOR.
>> AARON SPELLING WAS A GREAT
CREATIVE MAN.
HE CERTAINLY BROUGHT A LOT
OF JOY TO MY CHILDHOOD.
>> WE WILL ALL MISS HIM.
AND TV WILL MISS HIM
AND THE BUSINESS WILL MISS HIM.
YOU KNOW, HE WAS REALLY AN ICON.
>> Reporter: AARON RECENTLY
ATTENDED A BIRTHDAY DINNER BY
VIACOM PRESIDENT WHO SAID,
YOU WOULD MARVEL AT HOW
UNASSUMING, KIND AND GENTLE
HE WAS.

>>> RIGHT NOW, COJO'S BREAKING
DOWN THE TRENDS FROM THE ULTRA
GLAM.
NICOLE KIDMAN/KEITH URBAN
WEDDING.
HERE'S HOW YOU CAN PULL OFF
YOUR OWN WEDDING OF THE YEAR.
>> THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A JUNE
BRIDE, ESPECIALLY NICOLE.
THE QUEEN OF CHIC.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE'S A LOT WE CAN LEARN
FROM MRS. URBAN.
THERE, I JUST CHOKED UP.
THE WAY SHE PUT HERSELF TOGETHER
SO SIMPLE, YET SO STUNNING.
WE COULD DO IT, TOO.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BRIDE
ON A BUDGET.
THE BEAUTIFUL VEIL THAT FLOWS.
THE BEAUTIFUL TOULE FABRIC.
THIS IS SOMETHING SIMPLE.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING PULLED OFF
AN EMPRESS' HEAD.
INSTEAD OF GOING WITH
MID-LACE CLASSIC VEIL, SHE WENT
WITH SOMETHING REALLY LONG
AND FLOWY.
SO THERE'S A LOT OF DRAMA THERE.
SO YOU CAN DO THAT, TOO.
GO TO THE FABRIC SHOT.
SAY, GIVE ME TOULE, AND VOILA,
YOU LOOK LIKE A STAR ON A SHOE
STRING.
AND NOW FOR THE MAIN EVENT, THE
DRESS.
NICOLE DID SOMETHING VERY
BEAUTIFUL.
SHE DID IT VERY SIMPLE
AND CLASSIC AND CLEAN.
OBVIOUSLY HER DRESS IS UNTOLD
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SPENT
ON THIS DRESS.
MANY LITTLE FRENCH WOMEN WERE
SITTING THERE STITCHING ALL DAY
AND EATING QUICHE.
BUT YOU CAN DO IT, TOO.
JUST LOOK FOR A SILHOUETTE
THAT'S VERY FLATTERING
AND VERY SLIMMING WITH A LITTLE
UMPIRE
THIS IS NOT A COMPLICATED DRESS.
FEELING.
IF YOU'RE WONDERING
ABOUT THE SLEEVES, TECHNICALLY
THEY'RE CALLED LEG OF MUTTON.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT THEM.
BUT THAT IS THE WORD
THEY'RE NOT A CAP SLEEVE,
FOR THEM.
THEY'RE AN INLAID OF MUTTON.
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENJOY
TODAY'S LESSON.
THANKS, BOYS AND GIRLS.
AND, OF COURSE, THE JEWELS.
EVERY BRIDE WANTS
TO ACCESSORIZE.
I LIKE THAT NICOLE WENT
EXTREMELY SIMPLE.
JUST A LITTLE DIAMOND
WITH A PEARL DROP.
SOMETHING YOU COULD ALL DO.
BLING FOR A GOWN FOR A WEDDING
DAY IS REALLY KIND OF KAPUT.
WE'RE GOING TO A FUNERAL
AND WEARING ALL BLACK.
AND BRIDES-TO-BE, I HAVE ONE
WORD FOR YOU -- PEONIES!
AND BOTH MY LOVELY NICOLE
AND EQUALLY LOVELY MARCIA CROSS
WORE BOUQUETS MADE OF PEONIES.
IT'S VERY COMMON.
IT WASN'T PLUCKED
FROM THE GARDENS OF FLORENCE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
YOU CAN GOO TO YOUR LOCAL
NURSERY, OR YOU CAN EVEN GO TO
THE SUPERMARKET, GET THE PEONY
BOUQUET AND PICK UP SOME CEREAL,
TOO, FOR THE HONEYMOON.
MR. URBAN'S TUX, I LIKED IT VERY
MUCH.
IT WAS MODERN, SHARP, BUT STILL
GAVE A NOT TO WHAT'S
CLASSIC.
FINALLY, NICOLE SEARCHED
THE GLOBE FROM KENYA TO NEW
JERSEY TO FIND A GUY
WITH HEIGHT.
I THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A VERY
ELEGANT GROOM TO AN EXTREMELY
ELEGANT BRIDE.
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.
A LITTLE PRIMER ON HOW TO LOOK
LIKE A STAR, BUT BEING A BRIDE
ON A BUDGET.
>>> AND THERE IS STILL ANOTHER
SECRET FROM NICOLE'S WEDDING.
WE'LL TELL YOU WHERE WE FOUND
THE COUPLE RIGHT AFTER THE "I
DO'S" NEXT.
>>> WHICH WILL AND GRACE ALUM
GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL
IN ILLINOIS?
IS IT ERIC MRK KOR MACK, MEG AN
OR SEAN HAYES?
YOUR ANSWER IS NEXT IN THE
"E.T." BIRTHDAYS.
>>> IN TODAY'S "E.T." BIRTHDAYS,
WHICH WILL AND GRACE ALUM
GRADUATED IN WEST HIGH SCHOOL
IN ILLINOIS?
THAT'S SEAN HAYES WHO TURNS 36
TODAY.
>>> SO, WHERE WERE NEWLYWEDS
NICOLE KIDMAN AND KEITH URBAN
THE DAY AFTER THEIR WEDDING?
TODAY THEY MADE AN APPEARANCE
AT A SYDNEY HOTEL.
THE COUPLE APPEARED AFFECTIONATE
AND ALL SMILES AS THEY SPENT
A RELAXING DAY IN THE SEASIDE
CITY BEFORE LEAVING
FOR THEIR HONEYMOON.
NICOLE'S MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
WERE SPOTTED ENTERING
THE LUNCHEON.
AND THE FATHER OF THE BRIDE TOLD
REPORTERS HE WAS ACTUALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO ALL
THE WEDDING HUBBUB BEING OVER.
>> WE CAN GET BACK TO NORMAL.
>> WOW, WHAT A WEDDING.
HERE'S ONE LAST HOT TIP FOR YOU.
TUNE IN TO A BRAND-NEW EPISODE
OF HOUSE KITCHENS TONIGHT ON
FOX.
I HEAR IT'S SIZZLING.
>>> SOUNDS GOOD, VANESSA.
AND OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE MORE

>> Brooke: HONEY, I DIDN'T COME 
HERE TO INTERROGATE YOU.
>> Bridget: I KNOW THAT, MOM.
BUT YOU DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.
AS DO I.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY I KNOW HOW I 
FEEL ABOUT DANTE.
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE, JUST 
SEEMS --
I MEAN, HOW CAN SOMETHING THAT 
FEELS SO RIGHT TO ME, SO 
WRONG FOR EVERYBODY ELSE?
>> Brooke: WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE 
TO TELL ME HOW COMPLICATED LOVE 
CAN BE.
IS THAT HOW YOU REALLY FEEL?
ARE YOU REALLY IN LOVE WITH YOUR
SISTER'S FIANCE?
>> Stephanie: I CAN'T BELIEVE 
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED ON 
FELICIA'S WEDDING DAY.
>> Eric: HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HER 
THIS MORNING?
>> Stephanie: NO, I SAW HER IN 
THE COURTYARD WITH THE BABY 
EARLIER, BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT 
TO BRING IT ALL UP.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE HER
MISERABLE.
>> Felicia: DANTE.
I AM SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
>> Dante: WELL, I WOULD HAVE 
COME SOONER, BUT I THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE BEST FOR YOU TO HAVE 
SOME SPACE.
>> Felicia: WHAT'S BEST FOR ME 
IS MY HUSBAND.
>> Dante: LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY OKAY, FELICIA?
I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO 
EXPLAIN IT AND MAKE YOU 
UNDERSTAND ABOUT --
>> Felicia: I DO.
>> Dante: WHAT HAPPENED 
YESTERDAY, OKAY, THAT'S --
>> Felicia: IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS YOU'RE HERE.
>> Dante: BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF 
STUFF TO WORK OUT.
>> Felicia: SO, I'LL TAKE CARE 
OF IT.
>> Dante: NO, I'M THE ONE WHO 
CAUSED THE MESS, AND I SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO FIX IT.
>> Felicia: NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
LET'S JUST FORGET IT.
MOVE ON.
>> Dante: YOU CAN DO THAT?
>> Felicia: I WANT TO FINISH IT.
THE SOONER, THE BETTER.
>> Dante: I AGREE.
>> Felicia: YOU DO?
>> Dante: YEAH.
>> Felicia: THEN, GREAT.
BECAUSE I CALLED MY TRAVEL 
AGENT, WE CAN BE IN ITALY IN A 
DAY AND A HALF.
AND IT WOULD SO GREAT TO SEE 
YOUR FAMILY AGAIN.
AND THEY CAN WATCH DINO, WE CAN 
DO SOME TRAVELING.
AND HE WOULD LOVE THAT BECAUSE 
HE BONDED WITH THEM WHEN THEY 
WERE HERE.
>> Dante: WE'RE GETTING AHEAD OF
OURSELVES.
>> Felicia: THE WEDDING.
RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY.
I WILL NEVER MAKE YOU REPEAT 
THOSE VOWS BECAUSE THEY WERE 
PERFECT.
WE CAN'T TOP THAT.
THE WAY YOU PLEDGED YOURSELF TO 
US AS A FAMILY.
SO, WE HAVE ALREADY MADE THE 
COMMITMENT, SO THE CEREMONY IS 
JUST A FORMALITY, REALLY.
WE CAN DO IT ANYWHERE BECAUSE WE
HAVE THE LICENSE.
WE CAN GO TO VEGAS, THE JUSTICE 
OF THE PEACE --
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT 
WHEREVER WE DO IT, BRIDGET WON'T
BE THERE.
STUPID, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I 
BROUGHT UP HER NAME, BECAUSE IT 
DOESN'T MATTER.
WHAT MATTERS IS WE'RE MOVING ON 
TOGETHER.
[ DINO FUSSING]
OH, YOU HEAR THAT?
SOMEBODY IS SO HAPPY YOU'RE 
HERE, AS HAPPY AS I AM.
>> Bridget: MOM, THERE IS JUST 
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.
DANTE AND I CAN DEFINITELY HAVE 
A LIFE TOGETHER.
>> Brooke: BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM.
>> Bridget: YES.
I DO.
AND I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT.
>> Brooke: HOW MUCH?
>> Bridget: OH, MY GOODNESS!
YOU SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT GOING
TO BE AN INTERROGATION.
>> Brooke: HONEY, ARE YOU 
PREPARED TO TAKE DANTE AWAY FROM
HIS SON?
>> Bridget: I'M NOT TAKING DANTE
AWAY FROM HIS SON.
DANTE IS DINO'S FATHER.
HE WILL ALWAYS BE APART OF HIS 
LIFE.
>> Brooke: IF HE PURSUES A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, THEY 
WON'T LIVE TOGETHER.
NOW, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THE KIND 
OF GIRL TO PUT YOUR NEEDS ABOVE 
EVERYBODY ELSES.
ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THAT NOW?

>> Felicia: SEE, I TOLD YOU 
DADDY WAS HERE.
WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH, DIDN'T 
WE?
>> Dante: OH, I MISSED YOU, TOO.
VERY MUCH.
>> Felicia: OH.
AT LEAST HE'S TOO YOUNG TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED 
YESTERDAY.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE NEXT 
WEDDING IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH 
BETTER.
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO 
ACTUALLY END UP GETTING MARRIED.
>> Dante: FELICIA, ABOUT THESE 
PLANS YOU'RE MAKING --
>> Felicia: YOU WANT TO BE 
INVOLVED.
>> Dante: I THINK WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT IT.
>> Felicia: SO TALK.
>> Dante: IT'S NOT THE RIGHT 
TIME.
>> Felicia: I DON'T THINK WE 
SHOULD WAIT.
>> Dante: LOOK, WE RUSHED OUR 
FIRST MARRIAGE AND LOOK HOW IT 
TURNED OUT, HUH?
>> Felicia: SO, YOU FEEL LIKE 
I'M RUSHING YOU?
>> Dante: WE SHOULD STOP AND GET
OUR BEARINGS BEFORE WE MAKE A 
DECISION.
>> Felicia: I TOLD YOU.
VEGAS, THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE,
ITALY, I DON'T CARE.
>> Dante: WELL, I DO.
I CARE ABO YOU A LOT.
AND OUR SON.
AND OUR FAMILY.
>> Felicia: I KNOW.
DANTE, I WAS SO ANGRY AT BRIDGET
YESTERDAY, I DIDN'T STOP TO ASK 
MYSELF WHAT SHE WAS SAYING COULD
BE TRUE.
BUT THEN I WENT HOME, AND I WENT
OVER EVERYTHING IN MY HEAD.
WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR VOWS.
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT FAMILY IS TO
YOU.
AND I REALIZED THAT WHAT SHE WAS
SAYING COULDN'T BE TRUE.
>> Dante: IT'S COMPLICATED.
>> Felicia: IT DOESN'T HAVE TO 
BE.
WE CAN OVERCOME ANYTHING.
>> Dante: LOOK, YOU SAW ME 
KISSING YOUR SISTER ON OUR 
WEDDING DAY.
>> Felicia: SHE SAW HER LAST 
CHANCE TO MAKE A MOVE AND SHE 
TOOK IT.
BUT SHE CAN'T TAKE YOU AWAY FROM
OUR SON.
FROM ME.
YOU WOULDN'T LET HER, ANYWAY, 
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF MAN YOU 
ARE.
WHEN YOU PROPOSED TO ME, YOU 
MEANT IT.
WHEN YOU SAID THOSE VOWS 
YESTERDAY, YOU MEANT THEM.
SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, 
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.
>> Stephanie: DANTE?
>> Dante: I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> Bridget: FELICIA IS GOING TO 
BE SO DEVASTATED.
I KNOW THAT.
>> Brooke: YOU TWO HAVE GOTTEN 
VERY CLOSE.
>> Bridget: AND MAYBE WE WILL BE
CLOSE AGAIN, SOMEDAY.
>> Brooke: SHE IS YOUR 
HALF-SISTER.
SHE'S FAMILY.
>> Bridget: I CARE ABOUT HER 
HAPPINESS.
I DO.
>> Brooke: BUT YOU DESERVE TO BE
HAPPY, TOO.
>> Bridget: AND I WASN'T WHEN I 
WAS INOVE WITH A MAN WHO LOVED
SOMEBODY ELSE.
>> Brooke: SO, YOU THINK YOU'RE 
DOING FELICIA A FAVOR?
>> Bridget: YEAH, I THINK SHE'LL
BE BETTER OFF.
EVENTUALLY.
>> Brooke: AND DINO?
>> Bridget: HE WILL BE BLESSED 
WITH TWO FAMILIES.
ONE WITH HIS MOTHER.
AND ONE WITH DANTE AND HIS 
STEP-MOM.
>> Brooke: WAIT, YOU WANT TO BE 
MARRIED TO DANTE?
>> Bridget: YEAH, VERY MUCH.
>> Brooke: BUT BRIDGET, WHEN HE 
PROPOSED --
>> Bridget: I KNOW, I KNOW.
I TURNED DOWN THE BEST THING 
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
IT'S THE STORY OF MY LIFE.
I GET EVERYTHING BACKWARDS.
I SAY YES TO ALL THE WRONG 
THINGS, ESPECIALLY THE WRONG 
MEN.
AND I SAY NO TO HAPPINESS.
TO THE LIFE THAT I WOULD REALLY 
LIKE.
MOM, I HAVE A CHANCE NOW.
TO HAVE THAT LIFE WITH DANTE.
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.

WITH FELICIA?
>> Dante: YES, I DID.
>> Stephanie: GOOD.
>> Eric: WE'RE VERY WORRIED 
ABOUT HER.
>> Stephanie: SHE'S NOT VERY 
GOOD AT HIDING HER FEELINGS.
>> Eric: AND WHAT HAPPENED 
YESTERDAY AT THE WEDDING WAS 
PAINFUL.
VERY PAINFUL FOR HER.
FOR ALL OF US.
>> Dante: I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
THAT, SIR.

>> Dante: YOU WANT ME TO CHOOSE 
FELICIA.
I T IT.
>> Stephanie: NO, YOU DON'T.
NOT IF YOU THINK THERE'S A 
CHOICE TO BE MADE.
>> Dante: WELL, THERE IS AND I'M
GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE, 
WITHOUT ANY COMPLICATIONS FROM 
YOU OR ANYONE ELSE.
>> Stephanie: BRIDGET'S NOT 
GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.
>> Dante: SHE ALREADY HAS.
>> Stephanie: IT WON'T LAST, 
DANTE.
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER.
THESE TWO WOMEN ARE NOT 
EMOTIONALLY STABLE.
AND IT'S NOT BRIDGET'S FAULT.
IT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT SHE 
WAS RAISED IN.
IT'S TRAGIC, REALLY.
I MEAN, SHE HAS SO MUCH 
POTENTIAL, AND TO HAVE THIS SORT
OF IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR --
>> Dante: IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
STAND HERE IN FRONT OF ME, AND 
BAD-MOUTH BRIDGET, THIS 
CONVERSATION IS OVER.
>> Stephanie: YOU LOVE HER.
>> Dante: YES, I DO.
>> Stephanie: YEAH, I 
UNDERSTAND.
SHE'S YOUR IDEAL.
I MEAN, YOU'VE CHASED THE WOMAN 
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD.
AND HERE SHE IS, ABOUT TO OFFER 
YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE 
WANTED FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
BUT MY DAUGHTER HAS SOMETHING 
WONDERFUL TO OFFER YOU AS WELL.
>> Dante: I CARE ABOUT FELICIA 
VERY MUCH.
>> Stephanie: GOOD.
AND I CARE ABOUT YOU.
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE THE
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE.
YOU'LL REGRET IT, I KNOW.
>> Dante: I DON'T SEE BRIDGET 
THAT WAY.
>> Stephanie: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU
DON'T SEE THE BIG PICTURE.
THAT PICTURE INCLUDES NICK.
>> Dante: NICK IS MARRYING 
BROOKE.
>> Stephanie: I THINK THAT SHE 
WILL END UP WITH MY SON.
>> Dante: THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
>> Stephanie: YES, OF COURSE, 
IT'S MY OPINION.
BUT THAT'S -- SHE ALWAYS HAS.
SHE ALWAYS ENDS UP WITH RIDGE.
IF YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH
BRIDGET AND NICK IS FREE, HE 
WILL BECOME A MAJOR ISSUE IN 
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
HE'S FIRST IN BRIDGET'S HEART.
YOU CAN'T SEE THAT?
>> Dante: THAT WAS IN THE PAST.
>> Stephanie: YEAH, WELL, THE 
PAST, HISTORY AS THEY SAY, HAS A
WAY OF REPEATING ITSELF.
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS MOTHER AND 
DAUGHTER.
SHE SAID IT TO BRIDGET 
YESTERDAY.
THIS ISN'T A GAME.
YOU DON'T GET DO-OVERs.
IF YOU HURT HER, YOU WON'T GET A
SECOND CHANCE.
IF YOU CHOOSE BRIDGET, FELICIA 
WON'T TAKE YOU BACK.
AND I THINK YOU'LL LOSE THE BEST
THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPENED 
TO YOU IN YOUR LIFE.
>> Bridget: MOM, YOU HAVE NO 
IDEA WHAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANS TO 
ME.
>> Brooke: I JUST WANT YOU TO 
HAVE THE LIFE THAT YOU WANT.
>> Bridget: THANKS.
I -- I JUST DON'T KNOW IF THE 
REST OF THE FAMILY CAN 
UNDERSTAND THAT.
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY STEPHANIE.
>> Brooke: WELL, LIKE YOU SAID, 
THERE'S NO JOY IN BEING MARRIED 
TO A MAN WHO IS IN LOVE WITH 
SOMEBODY ELSE.
AND EVENTUALLY FELICIA AND HER 
FAMILY WILL REALIZE THAT.
>> Bridget: I AM SO GLAD THAT I 
DID.
>> Brooke: SO YOUR FEELINGS FOR 
NICK?
>> Bridget: YOU KNOW, MOM, I'M 
ALWAYS, ALWAYS GOING TO CARE 
ABOUT HIM.
BUT I UNDERSTAND NOW THAT WE 
JUST DON'T HAVE A FUTURE.
NOT THE WAY THINGS WERE, AND 
MAYBE, WE NEVER DID HAVE A 
FUTURE TOGETHER.
>> Brooke: I'M SORRY, HONEY.
>> Bridget: NO, NO.
PLEASE DON'T.
I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT 
YOU WERE TRYING TO DO FOR ME.
I DID IT.
YOU KNOW, I WAS TRYING TO DENY 
MY FEELINGS FOR FELICIA'S SAKE.
>> Brooke: AND THAT JUST CAUSES 
A LOT MORE PAIN, A LOT MORE 
TROUBLE.
>> Bridget: FELICIA MAY NEVER 
FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I DID TO HER
AT THE WEDDING.
BUT YOU KNOW, I STILL THANK 
GOD -- I THANK GOD THAT I WOKE 
UP.
AND I FINALLY REALIZED THAT 
DANTE IS THE ONLY MAN FOR ME.
>> Brooke: AND YOU, YOU ARE THE 
ONLY WOMAN FOR HIM.
>> Felicia: YES.
VEGAS, OR ITALY.
OH, OH!
AND SOMEPLACE TROPICAL, TOO.
FIJI, THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.
IT'S A REALLY IRONIC PLACE FOR A
HONEYMOON, ISN'T IT?
YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE WITH
EACH AND I'LHAVE MY FIANCE 
MAKE THE CHOICE.
THANKS.
BYE.
>> Stephanie: YOU PLANNING A 
TRIP?
>> Felicia: I'M PLANNING MY 
WEDDING.
>> Dante: WAS THAT YOUR MOM?
>> Bridget: YEAH.
>> Dante: YOU'RE CRYING.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
>> Bridget: I'M JUST CRYING 
BECAUSE I'M SO HAPPY.
YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY.
SO, SO, HAPPY!
>> Dante: YEAH?

>> Brooke: NO.
IN FACT, THAT WAS THE PERSON I 
WAS GOING TO NEXT.
>> Stephanie: HI.
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK 
WITH BRIDGET?
>> Brooke: I JUST LEFT HER.
>> Stephanie: GOOD.
I KNEW YOU'D DO THE RIGHT THING.
>> Brooke: I THINK I DID.
BRIDGET DID TOO.
>> Felicia: SO, SHE'S GOING TO 
BACK OFF?
>> Brooke: NO.
>> Felicia: NO?
>> Stephanie: NO!
>> Brooke: NO, I'M NOT GOING ASK
MY DAUGHTER TO DENY HER FEELINGS
FOR THE MAN THAT SHE LOVES.
>> Felicia: WHAT FEELINGS, 
BROOKE?
WHEN DANTE PROPOSED TO HER, SHE 
SAID NO!
>> Brooke: LOOK, I'M NOT HERE TO
DEBATE THIS WITH YOU, FELICIA.
I'M JUST HERE TO TELL YOU THAT 
BRIDGET IS VERY COMMITTED TO 
MAKING A LIFE WITH DANTE.
>> Stephanie: THIS IS JUST PURE 
UNADULTERATED LFISHNESS!
AND YOU'RE GOI TO LET HER DO 
THAT?
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
WHO DID SHE LEARN IT FROM?
>> Brooke: I DON'T MAKE 
DECISIONS FOR MY CHILDREN THE 
WAY YOU DO, STEPHANIE.
>> Stephanie: NOBODY IN YOUR 
FAMILY SEEMS TO HAVE THE ABILITY
TO MAKE ANY DECISIONS.
THIS IS SO TYPICAL OF YOU AND OF
HER.
FIRST SHE SAYS YES, THEN SHE 
SAYS NO.
THEN SHE SAYS YES, THEN SHE SAYS
NO.
GOSH, WHO DOES IT REMIND ME OF?
>> Felicia: DANTE DOESN'T EVEN 
WANT HER.
KNOWS HOW MIXED UP SHE IS.
BESIDES, WE HAVE ALREADY MADE 
PLANS.
>> Brooke: ANOTHER WEDDING?
>> Felicia: WE'RE ELOPING.
AND DON'T ASK WHERE, BECAUSE I 
DON'T WANT YOUR CRAZY DAUGHTER 
TRACKING US DOWN.
SHE'S DELUSIONAL, BROOKE.
AND SO ARE YOU IF YOU THINK I'M 
GOING TO LET HER STEAL DANTE 
AWAY FROM ME AND MY SON!
>> Bridget: WELL, DID YOU SEE 
FELICIA?
>> Dante: I DID.
>> Bridget: HOW'D IT GO?
>> Dante: WELL, IT DIDN'T.
I WANTED TO TELL HER ABOUT US, 
BUT I JUST COULDN'T.
>> Bridget: HEY, LOOK.
I MEAN, IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ISN'T 
EASY.
SHE'S MY SISTER.
I CARE ABOUT HER A LOT.
>> Dante: SHE'S THE MOTHER OF MY
SON.
AND SHE'S SUFFERED SO MUCH.
AND THEN FINALLY THINGS ARE 
WORKING OUT FOR HER.
FINALLY GOT A MAN IN HER LIFE 
WHOSE COMMITTED TO HER, AND DINO
COULD FINALLY HAVE THE FAMILY HE
DESERVES.
>> Bridget: SO, WE'LL HELP HER 
UNDERSTAND.
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.
>> Dante: TOGETHER?
>> Bridget: YEAH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
>> Dante: LOOK, WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT RIPPING FELICIA'S WORLD 
APART.
DEPRIVING MY SON THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE WITH BOTH OF HIS PARENTS.
SO, BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, YOU 
NEED TO BE SURE.
>> Bridget: ABOUT YOU?
>> Dante: NO, ABOUT YOURSELF.
IS THIS --
US, WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?
>> Bridget: OF COURSE, THIS IS 
WHAT I REALLY WANT.
>> Dante: BECAUSE STEPHANIE 
FEELS OTHERWISE.
>> Bridget: STEPHANIE?
>> Dante: LOOK, STEPHANIE AND 
YOUR FATHER HAD A LITTLE CHAT 
WITH ME BEFORE I LEFT FELICIA'S.
>> Bridget: LET ME GUESS.
THEY TOLD YOU THAT I'LL NEVER 
GET OVER NICK?
>> Dante: I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU 
LOVED THAT GUY.
I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE 
HERE, BRIDGET.
SO, BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING, I 
NEED YOU TO BE CERTAIN.
I NEED YOU TELL ME ABSOLUTELY, 
TELL ME --
>> Bridget: NICK IS NEVER COMING
BACK TO ME.
>> Dante: WHAT IF HE DID?
>> Bridget: LOOK, I DON'T CARE 
WHAT STEPHANIE SAID.
I DON'T CARE WHAT NICK DOES.
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS YOU.
I WANT YOU.
I WANT YOU, NOW.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE QUESTIONING 
MY LOVE FOR YOU AND YOU WANT TO 
KNOW THAT NOTHING IS EVER GOING 
TO TEAR US APART.
