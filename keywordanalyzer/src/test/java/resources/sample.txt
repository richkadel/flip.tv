NG TO WORK 
WITH AND GET 
GOING.
AND MERV SAID IN
THE REGAME SHOW,
NOT ONLY KNOWING
THE GUYS' 
SWINGS, HE CAN 
GET THAT DOWN IN
ONE DAY.
IT'S GOOD TO 
KNOW WHAT'S 
GOING ON BETWEEN
THE EARS.
MERV SAID ON THE
PLANE AFTER 
WATCHING 
GREENIE, HE SAID
"HE'S A GOOD 
ONE."
HE HAS SUCH HIGH
POTENTIAL.
WE AUNL THAT. 
MATT: IT'S BEEN 
A SOLID MONTH 
SINCE GREENE'S 
LAST HOME RUN, 
MAY 20TH AGAINST
SEATTLE.
AND YOU TALK TO 
SOME AND IT'S A 
MECHANICS ISSUE 
WITH KHALIL 
BEING A FEEL 
HITTER AND THE 
FACT THAT HE'S 
CONSTANTLY 
FEELING 
DIFFERENT AND 
CHANGING HIS 
STANCE AND 
APPROACH, 
SEEMINGLY AT-BAT
TO AT-BAT, THERE
ARE THOSE THAT 
FEEL LIKE IT'S 
GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT TO GET
INTO RHYTHM WHEN
YOU'RE DEALING 
WITH YOURSELF 
LIKE THAT, BUT 
THEN YOU CAN 
LOOK AT A GUY 
LIKE CAL RIPKEN 
AND SAY, THAT'S 
NOT TRUE, 
BECAUSE HE DID 
THAT ALL THE 
TIME, AND LOOK 
AT WHAT HE DID.
MARK: IT'S 
ALMOST LIKE A 
PITCHER CHANGING
HIS DELIVERY 
EACH AND EVERY 
PITCH.
GUYS TRYING TO 
BE CONSISTENT.
SOMETIMES THEY 
WILL ALTER THE 
RELEASE POINT 
AND THE ARM 
ANGLE ON CERTAIN
PITCHES, BUT 
MECHANICALLY 
SPEAKING, YOUR 
BODY IS PRETTY 
MUCH THE SAME.
MATT: BLEW A 
FASTBALL PAST 
HIM.
NOTHING I
MATT: TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
INNING ASK WE 
ANSWER THE AFLAC
QUESTION.
WHO IS THE FIRST
MANAGER OF THE 
RANGERS?
TED WILLIAMS, 
MANAGED THE TEAM
FOR 3 YEARS IN 
WASHINGTON AND 
THEN MOVED WITH 
THE TEAM TO 
ARLINGTON FOR 
THEIR IN
THEIR INNAGURAL 
SEASON, HERE.
TED WILLIAMS, IS
DO AS I DO, NOT 
AS A SAY, AND 
TED WAS ALWAYS 
FRUSTRATED WITH 
THE FACT THAT 
PLAYERS COULDN'T
DO PHYSICALLY 
WHAT HE WAS ABLE
TO DO IN THEIR 
SPOTS AND NEVER 
HAD ANY SUCCESS 
MANAGING WHAT 
WAS IN HIS 
DEFENSE A BAD 
RANGERS TEAM. 
MARK: A BAD, BAD
TEAM, AND THEN 
YOU GO ON -- 
THERE'S TOM 
GRIEV WHO USED 
TO BE THE 
MANAGER FOR THE 
TEXAS RANGERS 
AND HE PLAYED 
FOR TED 
WILLIAMS, HERE 
IN TEXAS, FATHER
OF BEN GRIEV.
MATT: HANK 
BLALOCK WITH 1 
GONE, HE SINGLED
IN THAT FIRST 
INNING SCORE FOR
THE RANGERS.
YOU KNOW, THE 
RANGERS WHEN 
THEY FIRST MOVED
HERE, THEY DID 
NOT HAVE A LOT 
OF CONTINUITY IN
THAT MANAGERIAL 
SEAT, IN FACT, 
BEFORE BOBBY 
VALENTINE SPENT 
ALMOST EIGHT 
YEARS HERE AS A 
MANAGER, THE 
LONGEST STINT 
THAT ANY RANGER 
MANAGER HAD WAS 
3 YEARS.
MARK: LET ME 
GUESS SOME GUYS 
IN BETWEEN.
WHITEY HERZOG, 
BILLY MARTIN, 
BUDDY BELL -- 
NO, HE PLAYED 
HERE.
MATT: RIGHT.
DONE ZIMMER 
PLAYED HERE, 
FRANK LACASEY 
MANAGED HERE FOR
3-PLUS YEARS.
THERE'S A LINE 
DRIVE FOR A HIT.
BLA INTLA A PURE
HITTER AS HE 
SINGLES INTO 
LEFT, 2 FOR 2 
TONIGHT.
MARK: SHARPLY 
LIT TO LEFT, AND
HE CAN TURN ON 
ONE AND PUT IT 
OUT OF THE 
BALLPARK AND 
HURT YOU THAT 
WAY, TOOCHLT 
SECOND TIME THIS
EVENING HE HAS 
GONE THE 
OPPOSITE WAY.
MATT: SO A 1-OUT
BATTER IN FRONT 
OF MARK DeROSA 
NOW.
HE GROUNDED INTO
A FIELDER'S 
CHOICE PLAY THAT
ENDED THE FIRST.
FIRST BATTER 
AGAINST MIKE 
THOMPSON SINCE 
THE FIRST 
INNING.
IT ENDS A 
STRETCH OF 8 IN 
A ROW RETIRED.
SO FAR SO GOOD 
FOR MIKE IN HIS 
FIRST GO-ROUND 
AGAINST AN 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
OPPONENT.
IT'S ONTHING 
WHEN YOU'RE -- 
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
GETTING THAT 
FIRST-EVER START
AGAINST THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
AGAINST THE 
ROYALS AT HOME, 
YOU KNOW, BUT HE
HAPPENS TO BE 
DEALING TO ONE 
OF THE MOST 
POTENT TEAMS IN 
BASEBALL ON HIR 
HOME TURF IN HIS
FIRST GO-ROUND.
MARK: IT'S A 
HIGH, FASTBALL 
HITTING TEAM.
THEY LIKE THE 
FASTBALL.
YOU CAN JUDGE 
THAT.
SO WHAT DO YOU 
DO?
YOU TAKE THE 
STING OUT OF THE
BAT.
HE'S THROWING 
CHANGE-UPS, 
PITCHING 
BACKWARDS, ON A 
FASTBALL COUNT 
HE WILL FLIP UP 
A BREAKING BALL,
TAKE A LITTLE 
OFF HIS FASTBALL
AND TRY TO MAKE 
THEM FISH FOR 
PITCHES LIKE 
THAT WHEN HE'S 
AHEAD.
I CAN GUARANTEE 
YOU ONE THING 
MIKE THOMPSON IN
A 2-2 COUNT WITH
A RUNNER ON HE'S
NOT GOING TO 
THROW A FASTBALL
FOR A STRIKE 
DOWN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE PLATE.
MATT: SAN 
DIEGO'S TURNED 1
DOUBLE PLAY 
TONIGHT, MARK 
DeROSA LINES UP 
THE MIDDLE AND 
WENT OUT AND GOT
THAT BALL.
BACK-TO-BACK 
1-OUT SIN GELS, 
AND TEXAS IS IN 
BUSINESS HERE IN
THE 4TH.
MARK: WE 
MENTIONED IN THE
PREGAME SHOW HOW
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THE BALL DOWN 
AND MARK DeROSA 
GOES DOWN AND 
GETS THAT ONE.
AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT, IF HE 
REACHES FOR IT 
LIKE THAT, HITS 
IT IN THE SWEET 
SPOT, A 1-HOPPER
TO CENTER FIELD 
YOU'LL TAKE IT.
YOU WOULD RATHER
HAVE HIM DO THAT
THAN HAVE A 
2-RUN SHOT.
MATT: SO NOW 
KEVIN MENCH, THE
D.H., HE HAS 
BEEN SWINGING A 
HOT BAT WITH 9 
KNOCKS IN HIS 
LAST 8 GAMES.
SPEAKING OF 
STREAKS, IT 
WASN'T TOO LONG 
AGO BACK IN 
APRIL THAT KEVIN
MENCH PUT 
TOGETHER A VERY 
IMPRESSIVE 
STREAK, TOMORROW
SON WORKING TO 
HIM OUT OF THE 
STRETCH AND MISS
TO GO MAKE IT 
2-0.
HOME RUNS IN 7 
CONSECUTIVE 
GAMES AND IN 
FACT, MISSED 
TYING A MAJOR 
LEAGUE RECORD 
FOR HOME RUNS IN
CONSECUTIVE 
AFFAIRS.
A BOUNCING BALL 
TO THIRD.
CASTILLA TO 
BLUM, THAT'S ALL
THEY GET AS THEY
CUT DOWN THE 
MIDDLEMAN, NO 
RELAY THROW, 
RUNNERS AT THE 
CORNER IS WITH 2
GONE.
MARK: LOOKED 
LIKE BLUM AT 
SECOND BASE 
COULDN'T FIND 
THE HANDLE.
CASTILLA GOT THE
BALL NICE AND 
MADE A FEED TO 
GEOFF.
HE CANNOT FIND 
IT.
MATT: NOW THE 
SOUTH SWINGING 
BRAD WILKERSON, 
HE GROUNDED TO 
SHORT IN HIS 
FIRST AT-BAT 
TONIGHT.
BOUNCING BALL TO
SECOND.
SO BACK-TO-BACK 
1-OUT SINGLES, 
BUT THE RANGERS 
ARE TURNED AWAY 
IN THE 4TH.
TIED.AT INSURANCE ?
WHAT INSURANCE
IS THAT YOGI ?
AFLAC.
[ Duck grunts ]
THE ONE YA' REALLY
NEED TO HAVE...
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED IT.
NEED WHAT ?
AFLAC.
WELL, IF YOU GET HURT
AND MISS WORK IT WON'T HURT
TO MISS WORK.
HUH ?
AND THEY GIVE YA' CASH
WHICH IS JUST AS GOOD AS MONEY.
AFLAC.
ASK ABOUT IT AT WORK.
[ Duck grunts ]
MATT: AFTER A 
STRONG START 
OFFENSIVELY, 
THIS HAS SETTLED
INTO A PITCHERS 
DO YOU LIVE 
DUAL, 1-1 TIE, 
AS CASTILLA 
LEADS THINGS 
OFF, CASTILLA, 
JOHNSON AND 
CAMERON HERE 
AGAINST VICENTE 
PADILLA, A RUN 
ON HITS FOR BOTH
THE RANGERS AND 
THE PADRES HERE 
TONIGHT.
VINNY SENDS ONE 
INTO RIGHT 
CENTER FIELD, 
MARK DeROSA AND 
GARY MATTHEWS 
ARE BACK, LOOK 
AT VINNY, A 
DOUBLES MACHINE.
A PAIR OF 
2-BAGGERS FOR 
VINNY TO START 
THE NIGHT.
MARK: DO YOU 
WANT ME TO SAY 
IT OR NOT?
MATT: SAY IT.
MARK: IT'S AN IN
AND OUT NIGHT 
FORECAST 
CASTILLA, 
DOUBLE/DOUBLE W.
YOU KNOW HE PUT 
SOME CHEESE ON 
THAT ONE.
VINNY TOO HOT 
FOR TV, 
UNDESCRIBABLE.
HE'S DOING 
DAMAGE WITHIN 
HIS 10TH DOUBLE.
VINNY SAID HE'S 
BEEN DOING 
DAMAGE SINCE 
HE'S BEEN SIX 
YEARS OLD, 
SWINGING THE 
BAT.
MATT: HERE IS 
BEN JOHNSON, AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO 
DO SOME DAMAGE 
HERE, A RUNNER 
IN SCORING 
POSITION.
MARK: GOT TO 
KNOCK IT TO THE 
RIGHT SIDE, MARK
TEIXEIRA IS 
PLAYING WELL OFF
THE BAG AT FIRST
BASE.
MATT: HOW ABOUT 
VINNY, THOUGH, 
MUDCAT?
WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT A VETERAN 
GUY WHO A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAD 
WRITTEN OFF AS 
DONE.
BEN JOHNSON INTO
THE CORNER, 
THAT'S TROUBLE.
FOUL IN RIGHT.
MARK: OH, MAN!
MATT: WOW!
IT LOOKED LIKE 
THIS BALL 
DROPPED INTO 
FAIR TERRITORY, 
BUT FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE BILL 
WILKIE WAS ON 
IT.
MARK: FROM OUR 
VANT VANTAGE UP 
HERE IN THE 
BOOTH, THAT 
RIGHT FIELD 
DISAPPEARS ON 
US.
HE GETS THAT 
BALL QUICKER OUT
IN FRONT, THAT'S
TROUBLE.
HE JUST MISSED 
IT.
MATT: AND HE 
SHOOTS THAT ONE 
FOUL.
MARK: WHAT'S 
WITH THESE NETS?
THERE'S ONE DOWN
THE LEFT FIELD 
LINE AND ONE 
DOWN THE RIGHT 
FIELD LINE.
MATT: PERFECTLY 
LEGAL.
MARK: REALLY?
MATT: YEAH.
I THINK IT'S UP 
TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL CLUB 
AS FAR AS IF 
THEY HAVE A NET 
POLICY BUT THERE
IS NOTHING ON 
THE MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL LINE 
THAT SAYS YOU 
CAN'T BRING A 
FISHING NET TO 
THE BALL GAME.
MARK: I SEE THAT
GUY HAS ONE.
IS THAT 
SPIELBERG?
MATT: THAT GUY 
LOOKED LIKE THE 
ACTOR, DANIEL --
ANYWAY, JOHNSON 
SHOOTS IT INTO 
THE CORNER, 
AGAIN FOUL.
HE'S REALLY 
PLAYING WITH 
RIGHT FIELD 
HERE.
YOU GOT TO LIKE 
THE APPROACH, 
LOOKING TO SEND 
STUFF INTO THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER 
AND JOHNSON HAS 
BEEN WIDE ON T. 
MARK: IF A 
PITCHER IS OUT 
ON THE MOUND AND
HE KEEPS SEEING 
THAT, LET'S SEE 
IF HE TRIES TO 
BUZZ ONE INSIDE 
ON HIM, HERE.
MATT: WHAT'S THE
NAME OF THIS 
GUY, MUDCAT?
DANIEL STERN.
MARK: GUY FROM 
"CITY SLICKERS?"
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: NO POINT 
ON THAT ONE, MY 
FRIEND.
MATT: PARTIALLY 
OBSCURED BY THE 
VISOR.
2-2 NOW.
MARK: I'M COMING
RIGHT BACK 
INSIDE HERE, 
NOW, MATTY.
MATT: OKAY.
MIKE CAMERON 
NEXT.
CASTILLA 
REPRESENTING THE
GO-AHEAD RUN ON 
SECOND BASE.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOING AWAY,
THOUGH.
MATT: 1 AWAY AND
STRUCK HIM OUT.
MARK: WELL, IT'S
THE RIGHT PITCH,
OBVIOUSLY, FROM 
VICENTE PADILLA,
AND THE REASON 
WHY I THINK HE 
WENT BACK OUT 
THERE IS BECAUSE
HE WOULD RATHER 
MISS DOWN AND 
AWAY TO BEN 
JOHNSON RATHER 
THAN TRYING TO 
COME OVER THE 
PLATE AND 
GETTING HURT.
EARL IN THE 
COUNT BEN HAD 
THE RIGHT 
APPROACH AND 
PADILLA WINS THE
BATTLE ON THAT 
ONE.
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON TRYING 
TO PICK UP THE 
BATTER, FASTBALL
STAYS HIGH TO 
MIKE.
CAMERON 0-2 
TONIGHT SO FAR 
TONIGHT.
SEE IF I CAN 
PICK UP VINNY TO
MAKE IT A 2-1 
SAN DIEGO GAME.
WE MENTIONED HOW
THE ALL-TIME 
SEASON SERIES 
BETWEEN -- THE 
ALL-TIME SERIES 
THAT IS BETWEEN 
TEXAS AND SAN 
DIEGO IS EVEN AT
8 APIECE. THE 
PADRES ARE 6-2 
IN SAN DIEGO, 
2-6 HERE AT THE 
BALLPARK IN 
ARLINGTON.
THERE ARE SO 
MANY NAMES AND 
FACES THAT ARE 
DIFFERENT ON 
THIS ROSTER.
COMPARING IT TO 
THE LAST ONE 
THAT PLAYED THE 
RANGERS IN 
INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY.
ABOUT THE ONLY 
REAL 
CONSISTENCY, 
HERE, STARTS AT 
THE TOP WITH 
BRUCE BOCHY.
3 BALLS AND NO 
STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO 
CAMERON.
LET'S SEE HOW 
CAREFUL VICENTE 
PADILLA IS WITH 
A BASE OPEN AND 
ONE GONE.
3-1.
MARK: EVEN 
LOOKED LIKE 
PADILLA ON THAT 
3-0 PITCH EASED 
UP A LITTLE BIT.
IT WASN'TS THE 
100% EFFORT ON 
THAT FASTBALL.
HITTING THE 
CORNER TO MAKE 
IT 3-1.
HE MIGHT THROW 
HIM A BREAKING 
BALL HERE.
MATT: INSTEAD 
IT'S BALL 4.
HE THREW HIM A 
FASTBALL THERE 
ON 3-1.
WOW.
DON'T EVEN 
BOTHER WIPING 
IT, DUDE.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: I THINK HE
STILL HAS PART 
OF A HOT DOG 
FROM A COWBOYS 
GAME LEFT OVER 
FROM THE FALL IN
THAT THING.
[CHUCKLES] HERE 
IS BLUM WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND.
MARK: WE NEED AN
EXTRA-BASE HIT 
HERE, MATTY.
MATT: BLUM 0-2 
SO FAR TONIGHT.
MARK: GOOD TIME 
TO BREAK OUT THE
RALLY STICK.
THAT TOOK CARE 
OF THE MONKEY 
STICK IN 
ANAHEIM, HUH?
MATT: I USED TO 
HATE THE RALLY 
MONKEY.
I LIKE HIM NOW.
THE THINGS 
THEY'VE DONE 
WITH HIM ON THE 
SCOREBOARD?
1-1 TO BLUM.
THESE ARE 
SITUATIONS WHERE
VICENTE PADILLA 
HAS GOTTEN 
TOUGH.
WITH RUNNERS IN 
SCORING POSITION
HITTERS ARE 
HITTING .31 
.217, AND WITH 
NO ONE ABOARD, 
HE'S LETTING THE
HITTERS HIT 
.302.
2 GONE IN THE 
SWIRLING WIND, 
AND HANK IS ABLE
TO MAKE THAT 
CATCH. IT IS 
BLOWING TONIGHT.
MARK: SOME FRIAR
FAITHFUL HERE IN
ARLINGTON.
SPORTING THE 
CAMEL JERSEY.
MATT: SO NOW IT 
WILL BE UP TO 
GILES WITH 2 
GONE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE WHAT VICENTE
PADILLA DID THAT
AT-BAT, MATTY?
OFF SPEED, 
POPPING HIM UP 
IN THE INFIELD.
AND WITH ONE OUT
AND THAT POP-UP,
THE INFIELD FLY 
RULE WAS IN 
EFFECT.
BATTER OUT, 
RUNNERS ADVANCE 
AT YOUR OWN 
RISK.
MATT: PIAZZA 
NEXT WITH 2 
GONE.
HERE'S GILES WHO
SINGLED, IN HIS 
FIRST TRY TONE.
THAT BALL HITS 
HIM.
THE WAY BRIAN 
REACTED IT WAS 
ALMOST AS THOUGH
IT MISSED HIM 
AND IT WASN'T 
UNTIL THE UMPIRE
SAID "TAKE YOUR 
BASE," THAT WE 
WERE SURE BRIAN 
WAS HIT BY THAT 
BALL.
MARK: THAT'S THE
FIRST PITCH HE 
THREW TO GEOFF 
BLUM AT THE 
AT-BAT, AUSHLGS 
AND IT GETS HIM 
RIGHT IN THE 
UNCLE HULKA, 
RIGHT ON THE BIG
TOE.
MATT: THIS IS 
WHERE SAN DIEGO 
NEEDS TO COME UP
WITH A BIG BLOW,
YOU DON'T NEED 
US TO TELL YOU 
THAT.
BIG BASES LOADED
CAREER NUMBERS.
SEEN PLENTY OF 
VICENTE PADILLA,
SACKS FULL, 2 
GONE, THIS IS 
SAN DIEGO'S BEST
OPPORTUNITY TO 
HANG A CROOKED 
NUMBER ALL 
NIGHT.
MARK: AND THE 
KEY IS FOR 
PIAZZA NOT TO 
PULL, SEE HIM 
TRYING THERE, 
MATTY, STAYING 
INSIDE OF IT 
NICELY?
MATT: PADILLA'S 
THROWN 88 
PITCHES TONIGHT,
AND I WOULD 
ALMOST SAY 
QUIETLY.
THAT PITCH COUNT
HAS RIS ENTO THE
POINT WHERE BUCK
SHOWALTER IS 
WATCHING THE 
NUMBER.
MARK: 33'S, 5'S, 
AND 8'S.
MATT: HERE IS 
THE NOTHING-1 TO
PIAZZA, SWUNG ON
AND SHOT INTO 
RIGHT FIELD, THE
BASE HIT WILL 
SCORE A RUN, 
THEY'LL WAVE 
MIKE CAMERON 
AROUND.
PIAZZA COMES 
THROUGH WITH THE
BASES LOADED.
ON QUE, PARTNER,
MUD TALKED ABOUT
MIKE LOOKING TO 
RIGHT FIELD AND 
ON THE SECOND 
PITCH OF THE 
AT-BAT, THAT'S 
WHERE THE LOVE 
COMES, OUT TO 
RIGHT FIELD AS 
HE DRIVES IN A 
PAIR TO MAKE IT 
3-1 FRIARS.
MARK: OH LOTTA 
LOVE.
TO RIGHT CENTER.
OH YEAH, BELIEVE
THAT.
MATT: IT WILL 
BRING THE 
PITCHING COACH, 
MARK CONNOR OUT 
TO THE MOUND FOR
THE FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
MIKE PIAZZA 
GIVES THE PADRES
A 2-RUN LEAD 
HERE IN THE 5TH.
MARK: THAT BALL 
GOES ON THE 
OUTSIDE AND 
PIAZZA STAYS ON 
IT NICELY.
WITH 2 OUTS, 
TREVOR HOFFMAN 
IS WAVING AROUND
CAMERON, RUNNING
ON THE HIT, 
RUNNING ON 
CONTACT.
MATT: THAT IS A 
VINTAGE PIAZZA 
SWING, TOO.
IT ALMOST LOOKS 
LIKE MIKE'S 
WEIGHT IS 
SHIFTING TOWARD 
HIS BACK LEG 
FROM THE MOMENT 
THE PITCH LEAVES
THE HEAD.
IT LOOKS LIKE 
HE'S ON HIS 
HEELS.
AND HE'S LIENING LEANING 
BACK.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
UP NOW, 0-1 TO 
HIM.
AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR MORE NOW 
WITH SAN DIEGO'S
HOTEST POWER BAT
ON THE TRIP.
GILES AT SECOND,
PIAZZA THE 
RUNNER AT FIRST,
2 RUNS IN WITH 2
GONE.
HE WAS LEADING 
OFF THE SECOND 
AND ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ 
DELIVERED OUR 
COORS LITE HIT.
A DRIVING HOME 
RUN, NO. 10 OF 
THE YEAR AND 
THAT TIED US ONE
APIECE.
MARK: LOOKS 
LIKE -- BRING A 
GLOVE TO THE 
BALLPARK NEXT 
TIME, BUDDY.
MATT: ADRIAN 
BEHIND HERE, 
0-2.
MARK: TONIGHT 
ANOTHER POINT 
ABOUT PAD YASHGS
MATTY, I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM GET 
HURT ON BREAKING
BALLS.
ALL OF HIS 
PITCHES, 
TONIGHT, I THINK
ON HITS THAT 
HAVE REALLY 
MATTERED HAVE 
BEEN ON THE 
FASTBALL.
HE'S MISSING 
WITH LOCATION ON
THE FASTBALL.
MATT: REMEMBER 
THE CRITICISM ON
PADILLA FOR A 
COUPLE OF YEARS 
IN PHILLY WAS 
FOCUS.
MARK: YES.
MATT: GONZALEZ 
SHOOTS THAT ONE 
FOUL.
HE HAD, AT 
TIMES, A RATHER 
ACRIMONIOUS 
RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE FRONT 
OFFICE 
PERSONNEL, AND 
EVEN COACHING 
STAFF IN 
PHILADELPHIA.
THERE WAS MORE 
THAN 1 BASEBALL 
PUNDANT THAT 
LOOKED AT THAT 
TRADE AND SAID
VICENTE PADILLA 
MORE THAN 
SERVICEABLE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
STARTER AND HE 
WAS EXCHANGED 
FOR NOT A WHOLE 
LOT IN 
COMPENSATION, 
ALMOST TO 
INDICATE THE 
PHILLIES WANTED 
TO UNLOAD HIM.
HE GETS ADRIAN 
HERE WITH A 
PITCH THAT 
CATCHES THE 
OUTSIDE CORNER.
THE DAMAGE DONE,
THOUGH, THE 
PIAZZA 2-RUN 
SINGLE MAKES IT 
3-1 SAN DIEGO.
MATT: PADRE 
FANS, HERE IN 
TEXAS THESE 
DAYS, A LOT OF 
FANS HAVE MADE 
THE TRIP TO 
ARLINGTON.
WE'RE NOT SURE 
IF THEY TRAVELED
IN FROM SAN 
DIEGO OR IF 
THEY'RE 
DISPLACED SAN 
DIEGO PEOPLE, WE
WELCOME THEM.
A DRIVE INTO 
CENTER FIELD 
THAT GETS OVER 
MIKE CAMERON, WE
HAVEN'T SAID 
THAT OFTEN THIS 
YEAR.
AND A 
FIRST-PITCH 
DOUBLE GREETS 
TWOM TOMORROW IN
THE LAST OF THE 
5TH.
MARK: MATTY, 
TALKED TO A LOT 
OF OUTFIELDER, 
AND IT'S TOUGH 
TO JUDGE THAT 
BALL OFF THE BAT
WHEN IT'S HIT 
DIRECTLY AT YOU 
OVER YOUR HEAD.
HE SQUARES UP ON
THIS BALL NICELY
AND LOOK AT 
MIKE, RIGHT OVER
HIS HEAD, 
DIRECTLY OVER 
HIS HEAD.
KID HAS SOME 
POP, NOW.
MENTIONED IN THE
MINOR LEAGUES IN
'05 HE HIT 25 
HOME RUNS.
MATT: ROD 
BARAJAS WITH A 
CHANCE TO DRIVE 
IN A RUN NOW, 
IAN KINSLER AT 
SECOND TO LEAD 
THINGS OFF, AS 
BARAJAS TAKES A 
STRIKE.
HE HAS HEATED 
UP.
BY THE WAY, IT'S
NOT NEARLY AS 
HOT DOWN HERE AT
GAME TIME AS WE 
WERE FEARING.
WE WERE LOOKING 
FOR TEMPERATURES
STILL IN THE 
90S, AND GILES 
OVER PLAYS THE 
BALL, AND IT 
WOULDN'T MATTER,
IAN KINSLER WAS 
GOING TO SCORE 
ANYWAY, 
BACK-TO-BACK 
OPEN THE 5TH 
EXAMINE BRING 
THE RANGERS TO 
WITHIN A RUN.
MARK: IDEALLY 
YOU WOULD LIKE 
TO KEEP ROD 
BARAJAS ON FIRST
BASE.
HE DOESN'T RUN 
ALL THAT WELL.
BRIAN OVERRUNS 
THAT AND WITH 
THAT
MISQUE, AND ROD 
BARAJAS WILL 
TAKE THE EXTRA 
90 FEET.
MATT: BACK TO 
THE TOP OF THE 
ORDER NOW, GARY 
MATTHEWS, JUNIOR
WHO HAS WALKED 
AND FLIED TO 
LEFT.
GETTING INTO THE
SCARY PART OF 
THIS RANGER 
LINEUP NOW, AND 
THERE'S NO PLACE
TO HIDE IN IT, 
BUT EVERY TIME 
YOU LOOK AT GARY
MATTHEWS, YOUNG,
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
AND HANK 
BLALOCK, YOU GOT
TO WORK PRETTY 
HARD, HERE.
MARK: UH-HUH.
YOU SEE GARY 
MATTHEWS DID THE
FIRST PITCH?
HE SHOWED BUNT, 
AND VINNY WAS 
CREEPING IN AND 
SWINGING AWAY 
THE SECOND 
PITCH.
MATT: POPPED HIM
UP.
CAMERON IN FROM 
CENTER.
BOY, THAT'S A 
BIG OUT AS ROD 
BARAJAS HAS TO 
HOLD AT SECOND.
1 GONE.
I CAN'T TELL BY 
THE WAY, WHEN 
THAT -- I CAN'T 
TELL IF THE WIND
IS KNOCKING 
THINGS DOWN OR 
SWIRLING BALLS 
OR PUSHING THEM 
OUT.
IT SEEMS TO 
CHANGE WITH 
EVERY PITCH.
MARK: I'M RIGHT 
THERE WITH YOU.
I'M NOT SURE 
THEY'RE NOT 
HAVING 
DIFFICULTY 
PICKING THE BALL
UP WHEN IT GOES 
UP IN THE AIR 
WITH THE 
SIGNAGE.
THE HOTEL LOOK 
OUT THERE IN 
CENTER, THE 
OUTDOOR MOTEL 
LOOK, THERE?
MATT: YEAH, 
THAT'S OFFICE 
SPACE UP THERE 
I'M TOLD.
MARK: YEAH.
MATT: SO IT'S 
MICHAEL YOUNG 
NOW, 0-2 
TONIGHT.
I KNOW THAT TROY
AIKMAN USED TO 
HAVE AN OFFICE 
OUT THERE, IT 
USED TO BE AN 
OFFICE 
DESTINATION 
ADDRESS, BUT I'M
NOT SURE THAT'S 
TRUE.
THIS IS A PRETTY
BALLPARK.
MARK: YES, IT 
IS.
MATT: BACK UP 
THE MIDDLE, A 
BASE HIT, ROD 
BARAJAS IS BEING
WAVED AROUND, 
MIKE CAMERON UP 
AND THROWING, IT
GETS AWAY FROM 
BARD AND YOUNG 
IS ON HIS WAY TO
THIRD.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] TIED 
AT 3 WITH THE 
GO-AHEAD RUN 90 
FEET AWAY AND 
STIM ONLY 1 OUT.
MARK: THAT'S THE
THING ABOUT THIS
TEXAS RANGERS 
TEAM, WE KNOW 
THEY CAN HIT AND
WE SURELY KNOW 
THAT A 2-RUN 
LEAD, 3-RETURN 
LEAD IS NEVER 
SAFE.
THEY CAN 
DEFINITELY SNAEK
UP ON YOU.
I'M GUESSING 
THAT'S GOING TO 
BE A SINGLE, 
SECOND ON THE 
THROW AND AN 
E-8, ALLOWING 
YOUNG TO GO TO 
THIRD BASE.
WE'LL HAVE TO 
SIT BACK FOR THE
OFFICIAL SCORE.
70 PITCHES FOR 
MIKE THOMPSON 
AND REALLY NOT 
THE BEST RATIO, 
BUT STILL A LOT 
OF WORK TO DO 
WITH THE 
GO-AHEAD RUN 90 
FEET AWAY.
MATT: SO NOW 
MARK TEIXEIRA IN
A SPOT WHERE A 
FLY BALL CAN 
RECLAIM THE 
RANGERS' LEAD.
HOW ABOUT A BASE
HIT?
YOUNG SCORES 
EASILY, AN 
R.B.I. KNOCK FOR
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
HIS SECOND BASE 
HIT OF THE GAME,
AND IT'S 4-3 
RANGERS.
MARK: JUST LIKE 
THAT, MATTY.
4 OUT OF 5 GUYS 
COMING TO THE 
PLATE HAVE 
GOTTEN KNOCKS IN
THIS TEXAS 5TH.
MATT: LOOKS LIKE
DARREN BALSLEY 
IS MAYBE A PITCH
OR TWO AWAY FROM
MAKING A VISIT.
HERE IS HANK 
BLALOCK, 2 FOR 
2, HIS FIRST 
BASE HIT HAVING 
SCORED A RUN.
NOBODY UP IN THE
SAN DIEGO 
BULLPEN.
BRIAN SIKORSKI 
IS JUST ABOUT TO
GWYNN A WARM-UP 
ASSIGNMENT NOW.
STILL A 
MANAGEABLE PITCH
COUNT FOR MIKE 
THOMPSON.
THAT'S NOT THE 
ISSUE.
IT'S AN 
EFFECTIVENESS 
PROBLEM.
FOUR OF THE FIVE
BATTERS HE FACED
HAVE REACHED 
SAFELY AND 3 OUT
OF 4 OF THOSE 
GUYS HAVE 
SCORED.
2-1 ON BLALOCK.
TEAM THAT'S 
HITTING OVER 300
IN THE MONTH OF 
JUNE.
THEY HAVE WON 3 
IN A ROW.
YOU DIDN'T 
EXPECT THE 
RANGERS TO 
SUDDENLY GO COLD
AT THE END OF A 
10-GAME HOME 
STAND.
MARK: NO.
HOW ABOUT THE 
LAST 10 GAMES 
FOR THE RANGERS,
MATTY?
THEY'RE HITTING 
.535 THE LAST 10
GAMES.
MATT: 
IRONICALLY, PLAY
BLA HAD BEEN ONE
OF THOSE NOT 
SWINGING THE BAT
EFFECTIVELY, 
ALTHOUGH HE IS 2
FOR 2 TONIGHT.
HE HAD BEEN 4 
FOR 17 COMING 
INTO THIS 
SERIES.
WHEN THEY CAN 
HAVE GUYS LIKE 
HANK BLALOCK AND
MARK TEIXEIRA 
NOT HITTING AND 
STILL WINNING, 
GETTING BACK 
INTO FIRST 
PLACE, THINGS 
ARE GOING GOOD.
THERE'S A FLY 
BALL TO CENTER, 
JOHNSON CALLING 
FOR IT.
2 GONE AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA STAYS 
AT FIRST.
SO NOW MARK 
DeROSA.
YOU KNOW, MARK 
DeROSA MIGHT BE 
THE BEST EXAMPLE
OF A GUY THAT 
HAS BENEFITED 
FROM A SPECIFIC 
HITTING COACH.
LONG-TIME 
HITTING 
INSTRUCTOR, 
HERE, RUDY 
JARAMILLO, WHO 
HAS MISSED SOME 
TIME, ACTUAL, 
BUT HE CREDITS 
RUDY JARAMILLO, 
AND HE'S NEVER 
HIT CLOSE TO THE
.333 HE'S 
HITTING NOW.
A BROKEN BAT AND
BASE HIT INTO 
RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE 
A PERMIT FOR 
THAT PIECE OF 
WOOD RIGHT NOW.
THAT IS REALLY A
SCARY BREAK.
MARK: THAT BAT 
DIED HAPPY, 
RIGHT?
BASE KNOCK.
RUDY JARAMILLO 
THE HITTING 
COACH WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH 
PROSTATE CANCER,
AND A LOT OF 
THESE HITTING 
COACHES HAVE THE
SAME APPROACH, 
THEY TRY TO GO 
THE OTHER WAY, 
THAT WAS A 
PERFECT EXAMPLE.
RUDY JARAMILLO 
WAS UNDER 
HITTING COACH 
HOUSTON, AND -- 
THERE'S RUDY.
MATT: YEAH, 
OZZIE GIAN PAID 
HIM A COMPLEMENT
EARL, HOW GOOD 
IS RUDY 
JARAMILLO?
HE GOT MARK 
DeROSA TO HIT 
.333, HE'S A 
GENIUS.
KIND OF A 
BACK-HANDED 
COMPLEMENT AT 
MARK DeROSA'S 
EXPENSE.
SO MENCH, WHO IS
HITLESS TONIGHT,
A BALL AND A 
STRIKE ON THE 
D.H., MENCH.
BUT AS WE KNOW, 
IT'S ABOUT THE 
PLAYERS, RIGHT?
MARK: 
ABSOLUTELY.
MATT: THINGS GO 
BAD, COACHES GET
THE BLAME.
THINGS GO WELL, 
PLAYERS GET THE 
CREDIT.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS 
FAIR, IT'S A 
REA. 
MARK: I KNOW 
THERE'S 2 OUTS, 
SO WE HAVE TO 
WAIT ON THIS 
PITCH.
I PUT IT IN THE 
SAME ANALOGY OF 
A TEACHER WHO 
HAS A CLASS.
THIS TEACHER 
PREPARES AND 
PREPARES AND 
PREPARES AND 
GIVES ALL THE 
INFORMATION TO 
THE STUDENTS.
THE TEST IS 
COMING UP THIS 
FRIDAY, HERE IS 
WHAT YOU NEED TO
KNOW, GOING OVER
THE PLANS, AND A
LOT OF CLASS IS 
FAILING, BUT THE
TEACHER IS 
TRYING TO 
PREPARE THESE 
STUDENTS TO DO 
THE BEST THEY 
CAN.
SOMETIMES IT'S 
THE STUDENTS.
MATT: EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE A 
MR. HAND GETS A 
JEFF SPICOLLI.
4-3 RANGERS.
S 
MATT: STAY TUNED
AFTER THE GAME 
WITH 
APRIL 1-ON-1 
WITH JANE 
MITCHELL, ON 
MIKE CAMERON AND
ERIC YOUNG.
IT'S ALL COMING 
UP AFTER THE 
GAME TONIGHT.
VICENTE PADILLA 
WORKING WITH A 
LEAD, AS THE 
RANGERS GET 3 
AFTER VICENTE 
PADILLA GAVE UP 
2 IN HIS HALF OF
THE 5TH AND WITH
THAT 1-RUN LEAD 
HE MAKES BARD 
GROUND OUT, SO 1
GONE FOR VICENTE
PADILLA.
6, 7, 8 BATTERS 
IN THE SAN DIEGO
6TH.
MARTY FELDMAN UP
IN THE RANGER 
BULLPEN.
SCOTT FELDMAN UP
AND GETTING 
HIMSELF PREPARED
TONIGHT.
MARK: WHAT ARE 
THE CHANCES OF 
HIS NICKNAME 
BEING MARTY?
MATT: I DON'T 
KNOW THAT 
THEY'RE THAT 
GOOD, WHAT IS 
SCOTT FELDMAN, 
28, 29 YEARS 
OLD?
MARK: SO YOU'RE 
SAYING THE YOUNG
BREED OF OF 
PLAYERS MIGHT 
NOT KNOW WHO THE
ACTOR WAS?
MATT: I THINK IT
WOULD TAKE A 
COACH TO HANG 
THAT NAME ON 
HIM, OR A 
VETERAN GUY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
MANY GUYS COMING
UP FROM 
SAN FRANCISCO 
ARE GOING TO BE 
FAMILIAR WITH 
THE 
OPTICALLY-
CHALLENGED 
CHARACTER ACTOR.
GREENIE HAS HIS 
FIRST KNOCK OF 
THE BALL GAME, 
UPRIGHT FIELD.
NOW VINNY 
CASTILLA WITH A 
PAIR OF DOUBLES 
TONIGHT, HE HAS 
BEEN SAN DIEGO'S
TOUGHEST OUT AND
THAT WILL DRAW A
VISIT FROM BUCK 
SHOWALTER.
DID YOU SEE 
VICENTE PADILLA 
YA CRACK A SMILE
THERE?
THAT'S GOING TO 
BE IT.
A 1-OUT WARNING.
A PITCHING 
CHANGE IS 
BROUGHT TO YOU 
BY MOTOWORLD.
WE'LL BE BACK.
MATT: SO VICENTE
PADILLA IS GONE 
AFTER 5 AND 
1/3RD.
EVERY TIME I SEE
HIM WITH THE CAP
OFF THAT IS 
BORIS FROM THE 
ROCKY AND 
BULLWINKLE SHOW.
FELDMAN IS A 23 
YEAR OLD RIGHT 
HANDER, WHO HAS 
BEEN IMPRESSIVE 
AGAINST 
RIGHT-HANDED 
HITTING, WILL 
TRY TO SHUTDOWN 
CASTILLA HERE.
MARK: WE TALK 
ABOUT THE 
MATCH-UPS, AND 
THAT'S WHY BUCK 
WENT OUT TO GET 
THE RIGHTY.
RIGHTIES ARE 
ONLY HITTING 
VERY LITTLE OFF 
THE RIGHT 
HANDER.
VERY TOUGH TO 
PICK UP THAT 
BALL.
MATT: THE 
RANGERS BULLPEN 
HAS BEEN VERY 
GOOD AS A GROUP 
IN NOT ALLOWING 
INHERITED 
BATTERS TO CROSS
THE PLATE.
ONLY 25% OF 
TWHOES INHERITED
HAVE COME AROUND
TO SCORE.
THAT'S THE 
LOWEST 
PERCENTAGE AMONG
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
BULLPENS.
GREENE WITH A 
COMFORTABLE LEAD
OFF FIRST AND 
THE PITCH MISSES
UP TO VINNY, 
1-1.
IN OTHER 
CATEGORIES, WHEN
YOU AVERAGE OUT 
THEIR RANKINGS, 
THEY RANK AROUND
THE MIDDLE OF 
THE PACK IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
CASTILLA SENDS A
FLY BALL TO 
RIGHT CENTER, 
TOO HIGH TO DO 
ANY DAMAGE THIS 
TIME.
MARK DeROSA IS 
UNDER IT, AND 
THAT'S THE FIRST
TIME VINNY HAS 
BEEN RETIRED 
TONIGHT.
MARK: YOU CAN 
SEE WHY HE HAS 
SUCH GREAT 
NUMBERS AGAINST 
RIGHTIES, THE 
DIFFERENT ANGLE,
IT'S NOT A 
SIDEARMER THAT 
IS THROWING 70, 
75 
MILE-PER-HOUR, 
HE'S GETTING UP 
THERE IN THE 
UPPER
UPPER 80'S, AND 
HE HAS A LOT ON 
THAT SINKER HE 
THROWS.
MATT: SO NOW BEN
JOHNSON WITH A 
RUNNER ABOARD 
AND 2 GONE.
BENNY HAS HAD 
RUNNERS ABOARD 
IN ALL OF HIS 
AT-BATS, SO FAR 
AND HE TAKES A 
STRIKE.
THIS HAS TO BE 
ANOTHER TOUGH 
SPOT FOR BEN IN 
THAT HE KNOWS 
WHEN DAVE 
ROBERTS COMES 
BACK, HE WILL BE
REACTIVATED, AND
THERE'S GOING TO
BE ANOTHER MOVE,
AND BEN'S BEST 
SHOT AT STICKING
AROUND IS TO 
PLAY OUT OF HIS 
TREE FOR THE 
NEXT TWO WEEKS 
OR SO UNTIL DAVE
RETURNS AND THAT
CAN LEAD TO ALL 
KINDS OF 
ADDITIONAL 
PRESSURES.
MARK: HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO
REALLY GO OFF, 
HIT THE BALL OUT
OF THE BALLPARK,
COME UP WITH 
HUGE HITS, HIT 
FOR HIGH 
AVERAGE, DRIVE 
GUYS IN, IN 
ORDER TO MAKE A 
TOUGH DECISION 
WHEN IT COMES TO
MAKING ROSTER 
MOVES WHEN THE 
DOCTOR COMES 
BACK.
MATT: A CHANCE 
TO TALK TO BEN 
BEFORE THE GAME 
TODAY, HE KNOWS 
HE HAS TO GO OUT
THERE AND PLAY 
AS WELL AS HE 
CAN.
HE'S NOT GOING 
TO GET CAUGHT UP
IN GOING 4 FOR 5
EVERY NIGHT.
LEFT CENTER 
ELD, THAT'S 
GOING TO SCORE A
RUN AS GREENE IS
AROUND THIRD.
JOHNSON IS INTO 
SECOND WITH AN 
R.B.I. DOUBLE TO
TIE US AT 4.
ON QUE, BENNY 
DELIVERS.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
BEN WENT DOWN 
AND GOT THIS 
PITCH, ALSO.
I MEAN, IT'S 
OUTER HALF, YOU 
CAN SEE THE 
UPPER HALF OF 
THE BODY GETS 
IT, AND HE'S 
TRYING TO GET 
INSURANCE OFF 
THE GEICO SIGN.
MATT: HE IS ONE 
OF THE RAW, AT 
TIMES SEEMINGLY 
UNREFINED 
TALENTS THAT THE
PADRES HAVE IN 
THEIR MINOR 
LEAGUE SYSTEM 
THAT AND YOU I 
WERE TALKING TO 
BOCH ABOUT 
YESTERDAY.
I'M A BIG FAN, I
KNOW YOU FEEL 
THE SAME WAY.
I LOVE WHAT HE 
BRINGS TO THE 
CLUB. HE HAS A 
LOT OF TOOLS.
HE HITS FOR 
POWER, CAN RUN, 
AND NOW MIKE 
CAMERON WITH A 
CHANCE TO 
REDELIVER A SAN 
DIEGO LEAD.
THE LEAD HAS 
ALREADY CHANGED 
HANDS TWICE 
TONIGHT.
WE'RE BACK TO 
EVEN, 4 APIECE.
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S BETTER?
BEN JOHNSON 
HITTING OFF 
FELDMAN WITH THE
GOOD NUMBERS 
HE'S HAD OFF 
RIGHTIES, SO HE 
GOT OFF THAT 
PITCH EXAMINE 
SQUARED UP ON IT
NICELY.
>> 1-1 FROM 
FELDMAN TO 
CAMERON.
THERE'S A DRIVE 
INTO THE 
OPPOSITE FIELD, 
THAT BALL HAS A 
CHANCE, MARK 
DeROSA BACK, HE 
LOOKS UP AND
IT'S GONE!
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MATT: MIKE 
CAMERON WAS IN 
EGYPT LAND.
CAMERON'S HOUSE 
IS LIKE A 
MUSEUM, VERY 
COLD AND YOU 
CAN'T TOUCH 
ANYTHING.
MIKE'S SECOND OF
THE TRIP, 5TH OF
THE YEAR, FRIARS
BACK ON TOP BY 
2.
MARK: OH, THAT 
BALL GOES RIGHT 
OVER THE HEART 
OF THE PLATE AND
MIKE, WATCH HIM 
STAY INSIDE THE 
BASEBALL NICELY.
HOW CLOSE?
WELL OUT OF THE 
REACH OF THE 
MARK DeROSA.
MATT: SO NOW 
GEOFF BLUM -- 
MARK: THE 
RIGHTIES JUST 
SEEM TO -- 
FELDMAN OUT 
THERE, YOU GOT 
YOUR .163 
BATTING AVERAGE.
MATT: COUPLE OF 
HOME RUNS FOR 
SAN DIEGO 
TONIGHT.
3 DOUBLES IN THE
ATTACK.
9 HITS APIECE, 
6-4 SAN DIEGO 
LEADS.
MARK: NICE SWING
BY CAMERON.
SWINGING THE BAT
WELL IN ANAHEIM.
>> THIS 
INTERLEAGUE 
THING AIN'T SUCH
A BAD THING.
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU ALL 
ALONG.
YOU KNOW, I'M A 
BIG PROPONENT OF
INTERLEAGUE PLAY
WHEN THE PADRES 
WIN.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: A SWING 
AND A MISS BY 
BLUM.
SAN DIEGO DOES 
MORE DAMAGE.
THEY HANG 3 IN 
THE 6TH.
AN R.B.I. DOUBLE
BY J
MATT: 6-4 
PADRES.
SAN DIEGO BACK 
ON TOP.
A REMINDER THAT 
COCA-COLA FAMILY
AND FRIENDS WEEK
ENDS ARE HERE.
LOG ONTO 
PADRES.COM AND 
GET 4 UPPER DECK
TICKETS AND 4 
HOT DOGS, AND 4 
COKES FOR ONLY 
$50.
WE TURN TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
6TH, AND A 
PITCHING CHANGE 
FOR SAN DIEGO, 
PADRES GO TO THE
BULLPEN FOR 
BRIAN SIKORSKI.
MARK: BRIAN 
SIKORSKI AGAINST
LEFT HANDERS, WE
HAVE SOME DUE UP
HERE, THEY ARE 
HITLESS 0-6 
AGAINST HIM, AND
WE KNOW HOW 
IMPORTANT IT IS 
TO GET THAT 
FIRST BATTER IN 
THE INNING.
MATT: FOR BRIAN 
SIKORSKI, THIS 
WILL BE HIS 
FIRST APPEARANCE
ON THE TRIP.
HE LAST WORKED 
AGAINST THE 
DODGERS, ON 
THURSDAY.
WE TALKED ABOUT 
IT IN ANAHEIM, 
WHERE 
OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR BRIAN TO GET
IN THE BALL GAME
HAVE BEEN 
SCARCE.
HE WILL BE 
LEANED ON HERE 
IN A BIG SPOT, 
NOT ONLY IN 
TERMS OF THE 
SCORE, TRYING TO
HOLD A 2-RUN 
LEAD BUT BRIAN 
SIKORSKI HAS 
ROOTS HERE IN AR
LINK TOVENLT HE 
BROKE INTO THE 
BIG LEAGUES WITH
THE RANGERS IN 
2000 AND, IN 
FACT, UNTIL SAN 
DIEGO CALLED HIM
UP THIS YEAR, 
HIS 10 
APPEARANCES WITH
THE BIG LEAGUE 
RANGERS IN 2000,
HIS ONLY MAJOR 
LEAGUE 
EXPERIENCE IN 
HIS 11-YEAR 
CAREER.
2 BALLS AND 2 
STRIKES TO 
BRIAN, RATHER TO
BRAD WILKERSON 
FROM BRIAN 
SIKORSKI.
AND A FULL COUNT
NOW, 3-2.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
BRIAN MAYBE A 
LITTLE STRONG 
OUT THERE, YOU 
KNOW?
SOMETIMES GUYS 
WHEN THEY'RE 
FEELING A LITTLE
FROGGY AND A 
LITTLE STRONG 
THEY'LL 
OVERTHROW A 
LITTLE BIT.
HE HAS 93, 94 ON
THAT FASTBALL.
THAT'S A PERFECT
EXAMPLE THAT HE 
HAS THE GOOD 
FASTBALL.
HE TRIES TO BURY
IS IN BRAD 
WILKERSON, BUT 
HE HIT THAT ONE,
FOULED IT OFF 
THE HANDLE.
HE WANTS TO GO 
AWAY, BUT HE 
JERKS IT ACROSS 
HIS BODY AND 
BRAD WILKERSON 
HAVING A TOUGH 
TIME CATCHING 
UP.
MATT: FOULED IS 
BACK AND IT'S 
3-2.
SAME STARTS ON 
TOMORROW TONIGHT
FOR GAME 2 OF 
THE SERIES.
JOIN US TOMORROW
AT 5:45, WE'LL 
BE WITH YOU FOR 
GAME 2 COVERAGE,
A FANTASTIC 
PITCHING 
MATCH-UP 
TOMORROW NIGHT.
BRAD WILKERSON 
LINES INTO RIGHT
FIELD, AND IT 
BOUNDS IN THE 
CORNER, GILES 
BRINGS IT IN 
WITH A BARE 
HAND, BUT BRAD 
WILKERSON ON THE
8TH PITCH OF THE
AT-BAT, DOUBLES 
INTO THE RIGHT 
FIELD CORNER TO 
LEAD THINGS OFF 
IN THE 6TH.
THIS IS EXACTLY 
HOW THE BOTTOM 
OF THE 5TH 
INNING STARTED 
FOR THE RANGERS.
MARK: YEAH, 
THAT'S THE FIRST
HIT GIVEN UP TO 
A LEFTY THIS 
YEAR BY BRIAN 
SIKORSKI.
SO THETHE EX-EXPOE,
FORMER NATIONAL 
LEAGUE PLAYER IS
ABOARD.
SAN DIEGO SCORED
TWICE IN THE 5TH
TO TAKE THE 
LEAD.
AND THEN IN THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
INNING, THE 
RANGERS OPENED 
WITH A DOUBLE 
AND
RACK AND RACKED 
3 TO CLAIM THE 
LEAD.
AND BRIAN 
SIKORSKI HERE IN
THE 6TH.
MARK: I 
MENTIONED A 
HIGH, 
FASTBALL-HITTING
TEAM AND IAN 
KINSLER WAS ALL 
OVER THAT ONE, 
AND HE LIKES 
THAT PITCH UP.
MATT: REMEMBER 
WHEN YOU AND I 
WERE ON THE 
FIELD BEFORE THE
GAME THIS 
AFTERNOON, 2:30,
3:00 WE WERE 
DOWN THERE FOR 
RANGER B.P., AND
YOU MADE THE 
COMMENT, "MAN, 
IS THIS A BIG 
BALLPARK."
AND IT IS BIG.
IT LOOKS BIG, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
FA
FASAD, AND IT 
PLAYS LIKE A 
BAND BOX.
MARK: UH-HUH.
MATT: BRIAN 
SIKORSKI 2 BALLS
AND A STRIKE TO 
KINSLER, AND 
BRIAN HAVING TO 
WORK DEEP IN THE
COUNT AGAIN.
FULL TO 
WILKERSON BEFORE
HE HIT THE 
DOUBLE.
AND QUICKLY 
ADKINS IS UP IN 
THE BULLPEN.
HE LOSES HIM ON 
BALL 4.
SO KINSLER IS 
ABOARD.
WE'LL SEE HOW 
LONG THE LEASH 
IS FOR BRIAN, 
HERE.
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND, 
NOBODY OUT. 
MARK: THE RUNNER
AT SECOND BASE 
AND NOW A FORCE 
AT ANY BASE, 
BARD MAY BE 
GOING OVER THE 
SCOUTING REPORT 
WITH VINNY, 
MAYBE A BUNT 
PLAY, WHO KNOWS?
MATT: THAT'S 
GOING TO BE IT.
BARD WAS BUYING 
TIME, 
APPARENTLY, FOR 
JOHN ADKINS.
LEAD-OFF DOUBLE 
AND A BASE ON 
BALLS AND 
QUICKLY THE 
PADRES GO BACK 
TO THE BULLPEN, 
A PITCHING 
CHANGE FOR SAN 
DIEGO.
IT WILL BE UP TO
ADD KINS TO WORK
DEEP AND TRY TO 
STRAND A COUPLE 
OF RERZ WITH 
NOBODY OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT 
BACK.
MATT: AFTER A 
SHORT RELEASE BY
BRIAN SIKORSKI, 
THE PADRES TURN 
TO RIGHT HANDER 
JOHN ADKINS HERE
IN THE BOTTOM 
HALF OF THE 
INNING AND 
IRONICALLY IT 
WAS ADKINS THAT 
HAD THE SHORT 
STINT, IT CAME 
IN ANAHEIM AND 
HE WAS GIVEN THE
QUICK HOOK, AND 
IT'S ADKINS 
TRYING TO 
CLEANUP AFTER A 
QUICK HOOK HERE.
MARK: IT'S GOING
TO BE A TOUGH 
JOB HERE.
YOU HAVE TO TRY 
TO TURN THE 
PAGE, LIKE A 
CLOSER WHO MAYBE
BLOWS A SAVE, 
LIKE TREVOR 
HOFFMAN, YOU GO 
OUT THERE AND 
ERASE T. THAT'S 
ONE OF THE 
QUALITIES THAT 
MAKES A SET-UP 
GUY, A MIDDLE 
RELIEVER. 
FORGET ABOUT THE
LAST OUTING, AND
COME BACK AND DO
WELL HERE.
MATT: THE 
RANGERS HAVE HIT
INTO TWO DOUBLE 
PLAYS.
BUNTING HERE 
THERE WILL BE NO
DOUBLE PLAY AND 
THE SACRIFICE 
WORKS.
GOOD EXECUTION 
BY ROD BARAJAS 
ON SOMETHING OF 
A NO-BRAINER 
CALL FROM THE 
DUGOUT, AND 
THERE ARE 
RUNNERS AT 
SECOND AND THIRD
WITH 1 MAN OUT. 
MARK: SO THE 
5TH, 5TH 
SACRIFICE HIT 
THIS YEAR FOR 
ROD BARAJAS, AND
HE DOES A NICE 
JOB BRINGING 
THOSE WRERS 
AROUND.
MATT: GARY 
MATTHEWS, JUNIOR
WITH A BASE ON 
BALLS TONIGHT.
HE STARTED PLAY 
WITH 30 
EXTRA-BASE HITS.
AGAIN, HE'S BEEN
QUIET TONIGHT.
ADKINS STARTS 
HIM WITH A 
FASTBALL FOR A 
STRIKE.
LET ME ASK YOU 
THIS, FORMER BIG
LEAGUE HURLER: 
OF ALL THE 
PITCHES THAT 
ADKINS THROWS, 
AND AS 1, A GOOD
2-SEAM AND 
4-SEAM 
FASTBALL -- 
FIRST THE PITCH 
HOME TO GARY 
MATTHEWS THAT 
MISSES.
DOES THE 
SITUATION HERE 
DICTATE HOW HE 
USES THE 
FASTBALLS?
MARK: I THINK 
FIRST OF ALL, 
ADKINS HAS TWO 
GOOD QUALITY 
FASTBALLS IN THE
4-SEAMER AND THE
2-SEAMER, AND IF
I LOOK AT THOSE 
EARL ON I WOULD 
SAY GROUNDER, 
BUT THE INFIELD 
IS PLAYING BACK.
GO FOR THE 
4-SEAMER IF YOU 
WANT THE 
PUNCH-OUT. I 
SEE WHERE YOU'RE
GOING, THOUGH, 
YOU CAN USE 
THOSE TO YOUR 
ADVANTAGE, YES, 
EARL ON IF YOU 
WANT A GROUND 
BALL YOU USE THE
TWO-SEAMER.
YOU GET THE 
QUICK OUT AND 
YOU CAN THROW 
THE 4-SEAMER.
MATT: PERHAPS 
NOT IDEAL TO GO 
OVER THE 
DIFFERENCES BUT 
IF THERE IS A 
RUNNER AT FIRST 
OR SECOND YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR THAT
GROUND BALL AND 
THE DOUBLE PLAY.
NICK THE GROUND 
BALL SCORES THE 
RUN.
IAN KINSLER 
ADVANCED TO 
THIRD.
AND NOW IT'S 
YOUNG.
MARK: WITH THE 
WAY THE THINGS 
ARE GOING AND 
THE RUNS THE 
PADRES HAVE 
SCORED, BOCH 
LIKES TO PLAY 
THE INFIELD BACK
BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO GET THE 
OUT.
MATT: IS THIS A 
SWING OF A GUY 
THAT'S WORRIED 
ABOUT HIS OPS?
MARK: [CHUCKLES]
HANGING BREAKING
BALL, I WANT TO 
SEE A GUY TAKE A
HACK LIKE THAT.
MATT: YOUNG 
FLIES TO RIGHT.
GOOD WORK BY 
JOHN ADKINS AS 
THE RANGERS 
SCORE 1.
WE HAVE A 1-RUN 
BALL GAME.
MATT: IT'S KIDS 
DAY WHAT THE 
PADRES TAKE ON 
THE MARINERS.
KIDS 14 AND 
YOUNGER RECEIVE 
THE GIVE AWAY 
ITEM OF THE 
YEAR, MUDCAT, A 
PADRES MR. 
MR. POTATO HEAD,
CALL 
877-PADRES-TIX, 
OR PADRES.COM.
MARK: YOU BET, 
CHILDHOOD MEMORY
THERE, BUDDY.
MATT: BRYAN 
COREY HERE FOR 
THE RANGERS.
MARK: BRYAN 
COREY TRYING TO 
IRON SOME THINGS
OUT.
I MENTIONED 
PITCHERS TURNING
THE PAGE AND 
FORGETTING ABOUT
IT, AND FROM THE
PADRES' POINT OF
VIEW, HERE IS A 
GUY WHO HAS BEEN
KNOCKED AROUND 
LATELY.
MATT: BRYAN 
COREY HAS 
CERTAINLY HAD AN
UNUSUAL ROUTE TO
GET BACK TO THE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
LEVEL.
GILES WILL LEAD 
OFF AGAINST HIM 
HERE IN THE 7TH.
THIS YEAR ALONE 
COREY HAS 
PITCHED AT 3 
LEVELS, 
INCLUDING MAJOR 
LEAGUE 
ARLINGTON.
TIME AT 
DOUBLE-AFRIDOUBLE-A 
FRISCO AND IN 
OKLAHOMA.
HE MADE HIS 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
DEBUT HERE 
IN 1998.
GILES FOULS THAT
OFF, GLER-2.
COREY NOT AS 
EXPERIENCED AS 
SCOTT FELDMAN, 
WHO WORKED LAST 
INNING, BUT 
STILL A GUY WHO 
HASN'T BEEN UP 
HERE IN QUITE 
SOME TIME AND 
HERE IS WHERE 
YOU FIND THE 
GREEN NATURE OF 
THE BULLPEN, A 
LOT OF YOUNG 
GUYS.
THAT'S GROANED 
OUT TO YOUNG, 1 
AWAY.
SO NOW MIKE 
PIAZZA, HE HAS 
COME THROUGH 
TONIGHT WITH A 
COUPLE OF RUNS 
BATTED IN 
EXAMINE THAT 
MERITS THE 
QUESTION, HOW 
HAS THE NATIONAL
FAIRED WITH THE 
D.H. IN PLAY, 
AND THE ANSWER 
IS, PRETTY 
EVENLY, A.L. 
BENEFITS FROM 
THE D.H. ALL 
YEAR LONG, OF 
COURSE.
AND IT LOOKS
PRETTY 
COMPARABLE.
MARK: EXCEPT FOR
THE SLUGGING 
PERCENTAGE, 
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MATT: MAY BE OF 
INTEREST FOR 
FANS TO KNOW 
THAT BEFORE THE 
GAME TONIGHT, 
COMING INTO THE 
START, MIKE 
PIAZZA'S -- 
RATHER THE D.H.,
THE PADRES' D.H.
POSITION, 
AVERAGING .208, 
NOT A WHOLE LOT 
OF PRODUCTIVITY,
THAT'S THE 5TH 
BEST IN THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
IN INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY.
THAT'S JUST A 
GUY GETTING HOT.
THAT'S ONE GUY.
YOU KNOW, PIAZZA
HAS BEEN THE 
D.H. FOR THE 
MOST PART IN 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY
FOR SAN DIEGO.
HE WAS 2 FOR 12 
IN ANAHEIM.
3 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE TO MIKE.
MARK: THIS IS 
WHERE IT GETS 
DANGEROUS.
ANY HITTER IN 
THIS BALLPARK, 
3-1, YOU LOOK 
FOR THE 
FASTBALL, TRY TO
ADD ONTO THAT 
6-5 LEAD.
OH, BREAKING 
BALL.
MATT: MISSED 
WITH IT.
AND PIAZZA IS 
ABOARD.
SEE IF MIKE IS 
ALLOWED TO STAY 
OUT THERE OR IF 
THEY WILL PUT A 
PINCH-RUNNER ON.
THE WAY RUNS ARE
SCORED IN THIS 
BALLPARK, I 
WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IN 
BOCH IS 
THINKING, I'M 
GOING TO LET 
MIKE RUN HERE 
AND GET A 5TH 
AT-BAT OUT OF 
HIM.
MARK: YEAH, HE 
DIDN'T RUN THE 
BASES THE FIRST 
TWO TIMES UP.
HE GROUNDED OUT 
AND LINED OUT.
MATT: ALL THE 
MANAGERS AT HOME
ARE THINKING 
WHAT THEY WOULD 
DO IN THIS SPOT,
THAT'S GOOD 
FODDER FOR THE 
WATER COOLER.
MARK: I WOULD 
LEAVE HIM IN 
THERE, 
ABSOLUTELY.
SO WOULD YOU, 
RIGHT?
MATT: YEAH.
THEN THIS IS THE
THING.
WHEN YOU 
CRITICIZE AND 
WHEN -- HERE IS 
GONZALEZ LINING 
IT TO LEFT, BASE
HIT, RUNNERS AT 
FIRST AND SECOND
NOW WITH ONE 
GONE.
WHEN YOU MAKE AN
ARGUMENT AS A 
FAN, AS A 
WRITER, AS A 
BROADCASTER, AS 
A TALK SHOW 
HOST, AS THEY SO
OFTEN LIKE TO 
DO, YOU MAKE A 
CRITICISM AND 
YOU HAVE TO 
THINK ABOUT THE 
WHOLE SITUATION.
IF THE 
MANAGER -- IF 
BUCK SHOWALTER 
DECIDES TO BUNT 
OR NOT BUNT, 
PINCH-HIT OR NOT
PINCH-HIT, DO 
YOU THINK HE'S 
MORE FAMILIAR 
WITH WHAT HE HAS
THAN THE NEXT 
GUY?
DO YOU THINK HE 
KNOWS MORE THAN 
WHAT WE KNOW?
THE ANSWER IS, 
OF COURSE.
NOW WITH RUNNERS
AT FIRST AND 
SECOND, BOCH 
WILL GO AHEAD 
AND REMOVE 
PIAZZA FOR A 
PINCH-RUNNER, 
AND MARK 
BELLHORN WILL 
RUN.
SO BARD THE 
BATTER WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND, 1 
AWAY.
GETS THE BULLPEN
HOT FOR THE 
RANGERS, AGAIN.
TEXAS HAS 
ANOTHER RIGHT 
HANDER DOWN 
THERE THROWING, 
FIRST FELDMAN, 
NOW COREY.
RICK BAUER UP IN
THE BULLPEN.
BY THE WAY, DO 
YOU THINK 
WHEN -- JOSH IS 
WORKING ON A 
LITTLE INGROWN 
BEARD HERE.
YOU THINK WHEN 
JOSH CEASE RICK 
BAUER UP IN THE 
BULLPEN HE GETS 
THE SHAKES, 
THINKING OF 
HANK?
JOSH, THE RADIO 
VOICE OF THE SAN
DIEGO CHARGERS, 
AND TV VOICE OF 
THE TEXAS 
RANGERS DURING 
THE SUMMER.
MARK: BARD IS 
HURTING DOWN 
THERE.
IT'S BEEN A 
WHILE.
LET'S TAKE A 
LOOK.
WHAT'S THE 
PITCH?
FASTBALL.
OH, WAS THAT OFF
HIS BACK ANKLE?
YOU DON'T SEE 
THAT TOO MUCH, 
DO YOU?
THE BACK ANKLE.
MATT: NO.
AT FIRST I 
THOUGHT HE 
FOULED THE PITCH
INTO HIS FRONT 
FOOT, BUT YOU'RE
RIGHT, IT WAS 
THE BACK ANKLE 
THAT TOOK THE 
BRUNT OF THAT 
SWING.
AND THEY'RE 
GIVING JOSH ALL 
THE TIME HE 
NEEDS TO GET THE
WHEEL RIGHT.
SO NOTHING AND 1
IT IS TO JOSH 
BARD WITH 
RUNNERS AT FIRST
AND SECOND.
BELLHORN AT 
SECOND, GONZALEZ
AT FIRST.
BIG SWING AND A 
MISS.
HE WANTED TO 
TEST THAT WHEEL 
IMMEDIATELY.
GREENE NEXT AS 
COREY TAKES TIME
BETWEEN PITCHES 
NOW.
1-RUN BALL GAME,
TOP OF THE 7TH, 
6-5 SAN DIEGO.
GOT 'EM.
IT MERITS 
WATCHING BARD 
WALK BACK TO THE
DUGOUT.
MARK: HE IS 
WALKING SLOWLY 
BACK TO THAT 
DUGOUT.
MATT: SO NOW 
KHALIL GREENE 
WITH 2 GONE.
STILL 2 RUNNERS 
ABOARD, GREENIE 
SINGLED AND 
SCORED IN THE 
6TH.
POPPED HIM UP.
OUT FROM SECOND 
BASE IS IAN 
KINSLER, HE 
YIELDS TO GARY 
MATTHEWS AND THE
2 BASE RUNNERS 
ARE LEFT 
STRANDED.
MATT: COME OUT 
TO PETCO PARK 
EARLY FOR 
SATURDAY'S GAME,
IT'S FEAST STA 
COL LOS PADRES, 
TICKETS START AT
$5, VISIT 
PADRES.COM OR 
CALL 
877-FRIAR-TIX.
PITCHING CHANGE 
FOR CHANGE FOR 
SAN DIEGO, 
EMBREE GETS THE 
7TH.
MARK: HE STRUCK 
OUT 2 ANGLES IN 
ANAHEIM, IN 
ORANGE COUNTY.
[CHUCKLES] 
MATT: EMBREE 
FACES MARK 
TEIXEIRA, HANK 
BLALOCK AND MARK
DeROSA, HERE.
SO MARK TEIXEIRA
TURNED AROUND 
FROM THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE 
PLATE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
TONIGHT.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
HAS BEEN EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY THIS
YEAR FROM BOTH 
SIDES OF THE 
PLATE.
THOUGH THE 
OVERALL NUMBERS 
ARE DOWN, HE HAS
BEEN EVEN 
BETWEEN THE 
RIGHT AND LEFT 
SIDE.
3 HOME RUNS FROM
EACH SIDE OF THE
PLATE, FAR MORE 
AT-BATS AS A 
LEFT-HANDED 
HITTER THIS 
YEAR.
1 RUN LEAD FOR 
SAN DIEGO, A BIG
SWING AND A 
MISS.
MARK: A LOT OF 
TIMES I LOOK AT 
HITTERS WHEN 
THEY'RE STANDING
IN THE BOX, AND 
IT LOOKS LIKE 
PERFECT CENTER 
FIELD ANGLE THAT
MARK TEIXEIRA 
WITH A SLIGHTLY 
OPEN STANCE IS 
SLIGHTLY OFF THE
PLATE, SO THAT 
TELLS ME THESE 
GUYS LIKE TO 
DIVE TO COVER 
THE OUTSIDE PART
OF THE PLATE.
REMEMBER A GUY 
BY THE NAME OF 
TIM WALLACH AND 
WOULD DIVE FOR 
THE BALL.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS AND 
STRIKEOUT 
RECORDED FOR EM 
COMBREE AS HIS 
FIRST PIECE OF 
BUSINESS 
TONIGHT, AND NOW
HANK BLALOCK.
I LIKE THAT 
MOVE, BRINGING 
EMBREE IN FOR 
THE 7TH, BECAUSE
YOU TURNAROUND 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
AND BAT HIM FROM
THE SIDE OF THE 
PLATE WHERE HE 
HAS BEEN 
TRADITIONALLY 
LESS LIKELY TO 
BEAT YOU WITH 
THE LONG BALL.
NOW LEFTY/LEFTY 
MATCH-UP FOR 
HANK BLALOCK, 
WHO TAKES A 
STRIKE.
6 RUNS ON 10 
HITS FOR SAN 
DIEGO, 5 RUNS ON
10 HITS FOR THE 
HOME STANDING 
RANGERS TONIGHT.
0-2.
BLALOCK STARTED 
OUT 2 FOR 2 WITH
AN R.B.I. 
AGAINST THE 
STARTER, MIKE 
THOMPSON.
BY THE WAY, IT 
IS THOMPSON WHO 
IS THE PITCHER 
OF RECORD 
TONIGHT.
MIKE HOPING FOR 
HIS FIRST WIN 
SINCE HIS SECOND
START OF THE 
YEAR.
MARK: THAT'S WHY
I WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE THE PADRES 
ADD ON A LITTLE 
BIT AND GET SOME
BREATHING ROOM 
AS YOU GO INTO 
THE 7TH, 8TH AND
9TH INNING, KEEP
THAT "W" IN 
FRONT OF 
THOMPSON'S NAME.
MATT: IF YOU'RE 
TUNING US IN 
LATE, A WIN 
TONIGHT FOR SAN 
DIEGO WOULD BE 
BRUCE BOCHY'S 
900TH CAREER.
1-2 NOW.
IF EVER THERE 
WAS A GUY THAT 
DIDN'T GET ALL 
CAUGHT UP IN 
STATS AND 
NUMBERS, IT'S 
BOCH.
BUT I THINK 900 
IS SOMETHING 
THAT EVEN HE'S 
GOING TO HAVE TO
FEEL PRETTY GOOD
B. 
MARK: OH, YEAH.
THINK OF HOW 
MANY GAMES THAT 
IS, MY GOODNESS.
>> OUT OF THE 
STRETCH, THE 
1-2.
2 BALLS AND 2 
STRIKES.
EVEN WHEN THINGS
WERE LEAN, IN 
THE IMMEDIATE 
POST- 1998 
GLORY, AND THE 
PADRES 
STRUGGLED, 
'9090, 2000, 
2002, 2003, 
THOSE WEREN'T 
PARTICULARLY 
GOOD TEAMS. 
LET'S CALL IT 
FOR WHAT IT WAS.
AND A LOT OF 
CREDIT IS THE TO
BE GIVEN TO A 
MANAGER THAT'S 
ABLE TO COACH 
VICTORIES OUT OF
TEAMS LIKE 
THOSE.
THE MANAGER OF 
THE YEAR AWARD, 
SEEMS LIKE, YOU 
CAN WRITE IT IN 
TO THE MANAGER 
WHO FINISHES THE
SEASON WITH THE 
BEST RECORD.
MARK: I THINK 
THAT'S -- 
MATT: OR WHO HAS
THE BIG PAYROLL 
AND THERE ARE A 
LOT OF MANAGERS 
WHO WILL TELL 
YOU THEIR BEST 
MANAGING JOB 
WASN'T WHEN THEY
WON THE DIVISION
IT WAS WHEN THEY
HAD TO COME OUT 
WITH A MORE 
DIFFICULT TEAM 
AND WIN.
MARK: I THINK 
THERE ARE TEAMS 
THAT COULD 
FINISHED SECOND 
AND THIRD PLACE 
THAT COULD BE 
MERITED MANAGER 
OF THE YEAR.
MATT: I AGREE.
CAR DEALERSHIP 
OF THE YEAR GOES
TO MOSSY NISSAN,
SIX LOCATIONS IN
SAN DIEGO 
COUNTY, 
INCLUDING POWAY,
OCEANSIDE, AND 
IF YOU GO BY 
NATIONAL CITY, 
TELL TIM HOWELL 
HELLO, TELL HIM 
THAT CHANNEL 4 
SENT YOU.
MOSSY KNEE KAUN.
NISSAN.


MATT: THE NEPHEW
OF -- MARK 
DeROSA HAS 
SINGLED TWICE 
TONIGHT AND 
GROUNDED INTO A 
FIELDER'S CHOICE
PLAY.
IF YOU CAN KEEP 
THINGS CLEAN 
FROM HERE ON 
OUT, THIS IS THE
LAST TIME THE 
PADRES ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH THE MARK 
TEIXEIRA AND THE
BLALOCKS OF THE 
WORLD.
2 BALLS, NO 
STRIKES TO MARK 
DeROSA.
MARK: YOU LOOK 
AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE ORDER FOR 
TEXAS, BRAD 
WILKERSON, IAN 
KINSLER, AND ROD
BARAJAS, EACH OF
THEM EXTRA BASES
TONIGHT AND 
THEY'VE EACH 
SCORED.
MATT: 3 BALLS, 
NO STRIKES TO 
MARK DeROSA.
KEVIN MENCH 
WAITING ON DECK 
FOR THE RANGERS.
MILLWOOD AND 
YOUNG JOIN US 
TOMORROW NIGHT 
FOR THAT 
PITCHING 
MATCH-UP.
CHRIS YOUNG'S 
RETURN TO 
ARLINGTON.
3 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE TO MARK 
DeROSA.
2 OUT, BASES 
EMPTY, SAN DIEGO
UP A RUN HERE IN
THE 7TH.
CLOSE GAMES 
LATE, ALWAYS A 
POSSIBILITY 
WE'LL SEE PART 
OF THE 
COMPENSATION FOR
CHRIS YOUNG, A 
POPULAR FRIAR 
FOR 2 YEARS, 
MORANDINI 
AKI.
MARK: AND 
HOPEFULLY WE 
WON'T HEAR 
"HELLS BELLS" 
TONIGHT.
THEY PLAY THE 
SAME THING FOR 
HIM AS HE COMES 
IN AS WE DO FOR 
TREVOR.
MATT: THAT WILL 
BE ALL FOR EM 
COMBREE, THE 
PODS ARE GOING 
TO GO TO SCOTT 
LINEBRINK WITH 
THAT TYING RUN 
ON BASE LATE.
THE 4TH RELIEVER
ON HIS WAY INTO 
THE CONTEST FOR 
SAN DIEGO.
PITCHING CHANGE,
A FRESH BULLPEN 
BEING USED 
DEEPLY TONIGHT.
BE BACK.
MATT: AFTER THE 
2-OUT BASE HIT, 
THE PADRES GO TO
THE BULLPEN ONCE
MORE AND IT WILL
BE SCOTT 
LINEBRINK TO 
LOOK FOR THE 
FINAL OUT HERE 
IN THE LAST OF 
THE 7TH.
INCH THE OTHER 
THING THE 
RANGERS ARE 
GOING TO HAVE TO
DO IS TURN UP 
THE DIAL, AFTER 
FACING MIKE 
THOMPSON WHO 
STARTED FOR THE 
PADRES.
SCOTTY WITH A 
GOOD FASTBALL, 
94, 95 
MILE-PER-HOUR.
MATT: MENCH IS 
HITLESS, 0-3 
TONIGHT.
TYING RUN ON 
BASE HERE IN THE
BOTTOM OF THE 
7TH.
FASTBALL BACK.
FIRST PITCH AT 
94 MILE-PER-HOUR
FROM LINEBRINK.
SCOTTY LAST 
WORKED GAME 2 OF
THE SERIES AT 
ANAHEIM.
ACTUALLY IT WAS 
A SUNDAY GAME 
WHEN SCOTT GOT 
HIS MOST RECENT 
WORK.
HE PITCHED AN 
INNING AND 
1/3RD, NOT 
ALLOWING A HIT, 
NOR DID HE WALK 
A HITTER.
AS WE TALKED 
ABOUT A LITTLE 
OVER THE 
WEEKEND, SCOTT 
IS ONE OF THOSE 
GUYS THAT 
THRIVES IN THE 
HEAT.
HE LOVES T. 
LOVES PITCHING 
IN IT, LOVES 
FISHING IN IT, 
LOVES PLAYING 
HIS GUITAR IN 
IT.
CHECKS IN ON 
MARK DeROSA.
MARK: JUST MAKES
YOU FEEL LOOSE, 
LIKE YOU'RE 
GETTING SOME 
WORK IN.
A LOT OF 
TIMES -- 
ESPECIALLY IN 
JOAQUIN ARIAS, 
SPRING TRAINING,
YOU WORKUP A 
LATH THEY ARE, 
YOU SIT DOWN IN 
THE DUGOUT AND 
YOU DRY UP, 
BECAUSE OF THE 
DRY HEAT.
HERE THE 
HUMIDITY, YOU 
GET HOT, YOU 
STAY HOT.
MATT: MARK 
DeROSA RUNS AND 
MENCH FOULS IT 
AWAY TO FALL 
BEHIND, 1-2.
YOU FIND IT 
INTERESTING -- I
CERTAINLY DO -- 
THAT NOWHERE IN 
THE BALLPARK 
HAVE THEY 
DISPLAYED A 
SCORE OF THE 
MAVERICKS GAME.
MARK: I FIND 
THAT ODD, YES.
MATT: WHEN ONE 
OF THE TEAMS IN 
THE MARKET GOES 
DEEP INTO THE 
POST SEASON, YOU
FEEL THE LOVE, 
RIGHT?
YOU SHOULDN'T 
FEEL THE 
COMPETITION.
NOT ONCE AND 
THAT GAME IS AT 
HALF TIME.
NOT ONCE HAVE 
THEY PUT THE 
SCORE UP.
MENCH POPS IT 
UP, SUCH A 
MENCH.
MARK: SWEET MAN.
MATT: NOTHING 
AGAINST A 
COMBINATION OF 
RELIEVERS IN THE
7TH.
WE MOVE ON TO 
THE 8TH.
MARK: THAT'S 
SWEET MAN.
MATT: 6 TO 5 SAN
DIEGO AS WE GO 
TO THE TOP HALF 
OF INNING NO. 8 
AND ANOTHER 
PITCHING CHANGE.
WHO SAID THEY 
DIDN'T CHANGE 
PITCHERS IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE.
RICK BAUER WILL 
WORK THE 8TH.
AND HE GETS 
JOHNSON, 
CASTILLA
CASTILLA.
MARK: THE PADRES
CAPITALIZED ON 
THE PITCHING 
CHANGES, AND 
SCORED A FEW 
RUNS.
COUPLE OF RUNS 
OFF FELDMAN.
THEY HAD HIS 
EYES GOING 
EVERYWHERE AFTER
THAT INNING.
MARK: AFTER 
LOOKING AT THAT 
PLAY, I THINK 
YOUNG HAD TIME 
TO GET IN FRONT 
OF THIS BALL.
IT WASN'T HIT 
ALL THAT HARD.
YOU CAN SEE HIM 
CHOPPING STEP, 
YOU KNOW WHAT I 
MEAN?
THAT GAVE HIM 
TIME TO GET THE 
BALL.
MATT: TRYING TO 
MAKE THE OMAR 
VIZQUEL PLAY.
NOW BEN JOHNSON,
WHO DOUBLED AT 
THE START OF A 
3-RUN INNING 
LAST TIME HE WAS
AT-BAT.
LOOKS LIKE 
THEY'RE GOING TO
CREDIT VINNY 
WITH A HIT ON 
THAT BALL.
SO AN 
INNING-OPENING 
SINGLE FORECAST.
FOR CASTILLA.
WE MENTIONED 
BOUR HAS 
CONSIDERABLE 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
EXPERIENCE WITH 
BALTIMORE, AND 
HE SEEMINGLY 
RODE THAT BIG 
LEAGUE BALTIMORE
TO TRIPLE-A 
ROCHESTER OR 
OTTAWA TRAIN FOR
THE PAST 5 
YEARS.
5 YEARS WITH THE
OTTAWA 
AFFILIATE.
MARK: THAT'S 
TOUGH.
IT'S NOT EASY.
MATTY, DO YOU 
KNOW WHAT I'M 
SAYING?
MATT: STILL 
BEATS WORKING 
FOR A LIVING, 
THOUGH.
MARK: IT DOES, 
DON'T GET ME 
WRONG.
IT'S AMAZING 
WHAT THE MIND 
AND BODY CAN DO 
TO STILL GET TO 
YOUR DREAM.
THIS IS THE 
BUSINESS WE 
CHOOSE.
>> THIS IS THE 
LIFE WE HAVE 
CHOSEN.
>>> IS THAT THE 
WORDS?
MATT: YOU NEED A
NAP.
MARK: I SLEPT 
UNTIL 2 TODAY.
MATT: [CHUCKLES]
REALLY?
MARK: I DON'T 
NEED NO NAP.
I DON'T NEED A 
NAP, RATHER.
MATT: 2 BALLS 
AND A STRIKE TO 
JOHNSON.
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK, MUDCAT, 
YOU PUT 
SOMETHING ON 
HERE, SEND 
VINNY?
YOU CAN SAY 
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
MARK: NO, I 
THINK YOU CAN, 
BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T WANT TO GO
3-1.
I THINK YOU 
MIGHT THROW HIM 
A STRIKE AND I 
THINK BUCK 
SHOWALTER AND 
THE RANGERS ARE 
THINKING, HEY, 
WE HAVE TROUBLE 
OVER ON FIRST 
BASE.
BECAUSE IF YOU 
GO TO 3-1 WITH 
JOHNSON THEN YOU
HAVE TO THROW 
HIM A STRIKE TO 
TRY TO KEEP THEM
FROM GOING FIRST
AND SECOND.
MATT: SWING AND 
A MISS, GOOD 
THING VINNY 
WASN'T GOING 
ANYWHERE.
HERE IS A PRETTY
GOOD EX-BIG 
LEAGUER LOOK 
ALIKE, FLIP HIM 
AROUND, TAKE 30 
YEARS OFF THE 
CALENDAR.
MARK: CAN I 
GUESS?
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: MARK 
FIDRICH.
MATT: YEAH.
MARK: GOOD CALL.
MATT: OUT OF 
STRETCH, 
CONSERVATIVE 
LEAD AND JOHNSON
LINES INTO LEFT.
MARK: HOW ABOUT 
THE NO. 8 AND 9 
GUYS IN THE 
PADRE LINE UP, 
CASTILLA AND 
JOHN SOVENLT 5 
HITS BETWEEN 
BOTH OF THEM.
MATT:
GOT SOMETHING 
MIDDLE IN, 
THROWS THE HEAD,
NICELY DONE 
MATT: AGGRESSIVE
AT THE PLATE, 
BENNY HAS DONE A
FINE JOB TONIGHT
IN HIS FIRST 
START BACK AT 
THE MAJOR LEAGUE
LEVEL AFTER 
BEING SUMMONED 
UP FROM TRIPLE-A
PORTLAND, AND 
NOW MIKE CAMERON
WHO HAS WALKED 
AND HIT A HOME 
RUN TONIGHT.
CAMERON BUNTING.
STARTER VICENTE 
PADILLA WENT 5 
AND 1/3RD 
TONIGHT, AND 
IT'S BEEN THE 
COMBINATION OF 
FELDMAN, COREY 
AND BAUER SINCE 
THEN.
YOU KNOW, YOU 
HEAR IT 
DISCUSSED WHEN 
PEOPLE BREAKDOWN
AN NFL ROSTER 
WHERE A TEAM 
SPENDS ITS 
MONEY, DO YOU 
SPEND IT FROM 
THE OUTSIDE IN 
WITH THE SKILLED
POSITION GUYS 
AND PIECE 
TOGETHER A LINE 
OR DO YOU DO IT 
THE OTHER WAY.
CAMERON BUNTING.
IS THAT CAUGHT?
IT IS AND 
ROBERTS IS 
DOUBLED UP.
WHAT A PLAY BY 
MARK TEIXEIRA.
[CHEERS AND 
APPLAUSE] 
MARK: MIKE 
CAMERON GETS 
UNDERNEATH THIS 
BASEBALL, AND 
MARK TEIXEIRA 
CHARGING MAKES 
THE CATCH, AND 
YOU CAN SEE IN 
THE BACKGROUND 
THAT BEN JOHNSON
WAS ANTICIPATING
THAT BALL BEING 
DOWN AND HE DOES
NOT GET BACK IN 
TIME, SO CREDIT,
ALSO, KINSLER 
BACKING UP ON 
THAT BLA FOR THE
FORCE PLAY AND 
THE DOUBLE-UP.
MATT: SO 2 GONE,
A RUNNER AT 
SECOND BASE AND 
MARK CONNOR 
COMES OUT TO 
VISIT WITH HIS 
RELIEVER.
I WANT TO GET 
BACK TO THE 
PAYROLL THING IN
A MOMENT, BUT 
THIS IS WHERE 
WHEN YOU PLAY 
MANAGER AT HOME,
WHEN YOU PLAY 
MANAGER IN THE 
STANDS, AND YOU 
GET ON A GUY FOR
NOT BUNTING, HOW
COME YOU'RE NOT 
BUNTING HERE?
CERTAIN GUYS 
DON'T BUNT VERY 
WELL.
MARK: SOME GUYS 
ARE PAID TO HIT,
SOME GUYS ARE 
PAID TO BUNT.
MATT: SO YOU 
DON'T ALWAYS PUT
THE BUNT PLAY ON
IN SITUATIONS 
100% OF THE TIME
AND THAT TIME 
BOCH PLAYED THE 
BUNT, AND HIS 
PLAYER DIDN'T 
EXECUTE.
MARK: EXACTLY.
MATT: SO NOW 
GEOFF BLUM 
TRYING TO COME 
OUT WITH A 2-OUT
KNOCK TO BRING 
THE RUN IN.
MARK: HE PLAYED 
IN THE BEST 
INTEREST OF HIS 
TEAM TO GET THE 
RUNNERS OVER.
THE PLAYER 
DIDN'T EXECUTE.
MATT: 2 BALLS, 
NO STRIKES THE 
COUNT TO BLUM.
MARK: AND MIKE 
CAMERON WOULD 
TELL YOU "I BLEW
IT.
I DIDN'T GET THE
JOB DONE."
MATT: GREAT PLAY
BY MARK TEIXEIRA
AGAIN.
OH MY GOODNESS, 
DUDE HERE SAVED 
A FEW RUNS.
NOT 1 BUT 2 
FANTASTIC 
EFFORTS BY MARK 
TEIXEIRA IN THE 
FIELD.
NOTHING IN THE 
PADRE 8TH.
MATT: BE SURE 
TOP TUNE INTO 
SAN DIEGO 
INSIDER TOMORROW
NIGHT.
IMMEDIATELY 
AFTER THE PADRES
GAME TOMORROW 
NIGHT.
THE BATTLE LINES
ARE BEING DRAWN 
IN THE FIGHT OF 
WHERE TO PUT SAN
DIEGO'S AIRPORT,
AND SOME SAY 
MIRAMAR IS THE 
ANSWER, AND SOME
SAY NO WAY.
WILL JOINT USE 
WORK?
SOME SAY IT 
WILL.
AFTER LIVE 
COVERAGE OF THE 
PADRES.
MARK: WHY DO YOU
THINK IT SHOULD 
GO?
MATT: I DON'T 
KNOW A THING 
ABOUT THE ISSUE 
AND I'M NOT 
ABOUT TO OPINE.
WHERE DO YOU 
THINK?
RAMONA, 
SOMEPLACE CLOSE 
TO THE HOUSE, 
ALPINE?
HERE IS BRAD 
WILKERSON 
LEADING THINGS 
OFF IN THE HOME 
8TH.
LINEBRINK SEWED 
UP THE FINAL OUT
IN THE 7TH, 
GETTING THE 
FINAL BASE 
RUNNER.
HIS LAST OUTING 
WAS GOOD FOR AN 
INNING AND A 
THIRD.
HE HAS BRAD 
WILKERSON OUT IN
FRONT.
MARK: THAT LAST 
HIT BY MARK 
DeROSA IS THE 
DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN NOT 
FACING A GUY 
LIKE HANK 
BLALOCK AND MARK
TEIXEIRA, AND IF
IT'S A PERFECT 
INNING, YOU HAVE
1, 2, 3 AND MARK
TEIXEIRA WOULD 
BE THIRD.
MATT: MARK 
TEIXEIRA WITH A 
COUPLE OF 
FANTASTIC PLAYS 
IN THAT TOP OF 
THE 8TH TO KEEP 
THE PADRES OFF 
THE BOARD.
I DON'T THINK 
THE RANGERS HAVE
BEEN WITHOUT AN 
IMPACT FIRST 
BASEMAN SINCE 
THEY MOVED INTO 
THIS BALLPARK 
SOME 12 YEARS 
AGO.
PALMERO FOR SO 
MANY YEARS, LEE 
STEVENS 
REJUVENATED HIS 
CAREER HERE, AS 
A RANGER, HAD A 
COUPLE OF GOOD 
YEARS, AND MORE 
RECENTLY, A 
NUMBER OF 
TALENTED FIRST 
BASE MEN, AS 
BRAD WILKERSON 
SWINGS AND 
MISSES.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
TO FORMER RANGER
PROPERTY TRAVIS 
HAFNER, THEY 
HAVE 
MANUFACTURED 
SOME GOOD CORNER
INFIELDERS, 
HERE.
MARK: LOOK AT 
MARK TEIXEIRA, 
HE COULD PASS 
FOR THE LITTLE 
BROTHER OF MARK 
CUBAN, OWNER OF 
THE DALLAS MAVS.
MATT: I'M SURE 
HE'LL BE 
THRILLED TO HEAR
THAT.
IAN KINSLER WITH
1 GONE.
LOOKS LIKE A BAT
BOY.
THAT'S TO BLUM.
GET THE OUT.
FOR A GUY THAT'S
ACCOMPLISHED AS 
MUCH AS MARK 
TEIXEIRA HAS 
ACCOMPLISHED IN 
MAJOR LEAGUE 
BASEBALL, HE'S 
ONLY 25, 26.
IF YOU PUT A NO.
99 ON HIS BACK 
AND GAVE HIM 
RUBBER CLEATS, 
HE WOULD LOOK 
LIKE A BAT BOY.
WHAT A GREAT 
FUTURE.
2 GONE NOW FOR 
ROD BARAJAS.
SWING AND A FLY 
BALL INTO CENTER
FIELD.
LINEBRINK GETS 
THEM IN ORDER IN
THE 8TH.
WE HEAD TO 
INNING NO. 9 
WITH SAN DIEGO 
ON TOP 6-5.
MATT: LOG ONTO 
PADRES.COM AND 
CASTILLA YOUR 
VOTES FOR THE 
2006 ALL-STAR 
TEAM, HELP 
MAKING SURE THE 
PADRES ARE WE

ANOTHER PITCHING
CHANGE FOR THE 
RANGERS.
THEY'RE ON 35TH 
OF THE EVENING.
LEFT HANDER RON 
MAHAY TAKES OVER
IN THE 9TH.
MARK: THE LAST 
15 APPEARANCES 
FOR THE LEFT 
HANDER, HE'S 
ONLY GIVEN UP 3 
RUNS.
WE TALKED ABOUT 
HITTING NUMBERS,
AND RON IS 
HOLDING LEFTIES 
TO A .175 
AVERAGE.
AND WHAT DO YOU 
KNOW, BUCK 
SHOWALTER KNOWS 
THAT GILES IS 
LEADING OFF, 
HE'S GOING TO 
LOOK AT 
PERCENTAGES, 
HERE.
MATT: RON MAHAY 
IS IN HIS 4TH 
YEAR HERE WITH 
THE RANGERS.
HE HAS BEEN ONE 
OF BUCK 
SHOWALTER'S 
FAVORITE GUYS TO
USE IN THIS 
BALLPARK.
HIS CAREER 
E.R.A. HERE MANY
ARLINGTON COMING
INTO THE YEAR, 
2.90. THAT IS 
THE SECOND 
LOWEST AMONG 
QUALIFIED 
RANGERS OF ALL 
TIME.
AND HE GETS 
GILES TO GROUND 
OUT TO OPEN THE 
9TH.
RON MAHAY GOT A 
LOT OF ATTENTION
NERL HIS CAREER 
WHEN HE BROKE IN
WITH THE RED SOX
IN 1997 AS HE 
HAD PLAYED HIS 
ENTIRE MINOR 
LEAGUE CAREER 
PREVIOUSLY AS A 
POSITION PLAYER.
THE RED SOX, 
RATHER LATE IN 
HIS BASEBALL 
LIFE PUT HIM ON 
THE MOUND.
HE'S HAD NOTHING
BUT SUCCESS 
SINCE.
34-YEAR OLD 
SOUTHPAW HAS 
BEEN AT THE BIG 
LEAGUE LEVEL IN 
ONE UNIFORM OR 
ANOTHER SINCE 
THAT '97 
CAMPAIGN.
TIME WITH THE 
MARLINS, A'S, 
CUBS, TWO QUICK 
OUTS FOR RON 
MAHAY HERE IN 
THE 9TH.
MARK: MAY HAY MAHAY HAS 
A BREAKING BALL,
AND IF YOU ARE A
POSITION PLAYER 
EXAMINE THINGS 
AREN'T GOING 
YOUR WAY, WHY 
NOT GET UP ON 
THE HILL, GIVE 
IT A CHANCE.
MATT: TREVOR 
HOFFMAN UP IN 
THE SAN DIEGO 
BULLPEN.
ADRIAN GONZALEZ 
WITH A BOUNCING 
BALL TO KINSLER 
WHO HAD HIM 
DEFENDED 
PERFECTLY AND 
IT'S A VERY 
QUICK 1, 2, 3.
TREVOR UP NEXT.
MATT: LAST OF 
THE 9TH, SAN 
DIEGO UP A RUN 
AND THEY TURN TO
CLOSER TREVOR 
HOFFMAN TO TRY 
TO SHUT THIS ONE
DOWN ON THE 
ROAD.
TREVOR LOOKING 
FOR SAVE 17 
TONIGHT AS IT 
APPEARS MORE AND
MORE LIKELY WITH
EACH SAVE 
OPPORTUNITY THAT
HE IS HEADED TO 
THE ALL-STAR 
GAME FOR THE 5TH
TIME IN HIS 
CAREER.
HE WILL FACE THE
RANGERS HERE, 
TOP OF THE 
OSHGSD AND 
BETWEEN GARY 
MATTHEWS, YOUNG 
AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA, THERE 
IS A COMBINED 
ONE AT-BAT, AND 
THAT'S GARY 
MATTHEWS, WHO IS
0 FOR 1 AGAINST 
HOFFMAN, AND WE 
KNOW THAT THOSE 
SITUATIONS 
USUALLY FAVOR 
THE PADRES, 
ESPECIALLY WITH 
TREVOR'S 
CHANGE-UP.
BOWEN REPLACING 
BARD BEHIND THE 
PLATE.
MARK: LAST TIME 
OUT FOR TWEFR 
TREVOR
-- TREVOR WAS 
THAT TIME IN 
ANAHEIM LAST 
FRIDAY, WHERE HE
PUNCHEDED OUT 
THE BATTERS.
MATT: TREVOR 
STARTS HIM WITH 
A FASTBALL, 
HIGH.
1-1.
THE RANGERS HAVE
STRUGGLED IN 
1-RUN GAMES THIS
YEAR, 8 WINS, 12
LOSSES, SAN 
DIEGO 12-9 IN 
ONE-RUN AFFAIRS.
TEXAS HAD SO 
MANY TROUBLE 
EARL CLOSING OUT
BALL GAMES.
SOME FAILED 
CLOSERS 
EXPERIMENTS, AKI
SETTLED IN 
NICELY TO DO A 
GOOD JOB IN THE 
BACK OF THEIR 
BULLPEN.
REMEMBER, HE DID
NOT START THE 
YEAR AS THEIR 
CLOSER.
THIS IS WHERE 
SAN DIEGO HAS 
HAD THE KIND OF 
CONSISTENCY THAT
WE MIGHT TAKE 
FOR GRANTED IN 
OTHER MAJOR 
LEAGUE CITIES.
2-2.
TREVOR IN HIS 
CAREER HAS 
PITCHED HERE IN 
THIS BALLPARK 
TWICE.
HE SAVED ONE OF 
THOSE TWO GAMES,
BUT IN 2 AND 
1/3RD INNINGS 
WORKED TOTAL 
HERE, HAS GIVEN 
UP 3 EARNED 
RUNS, SO LIMITED
EXPERIENCE, BUT 
YOU COULDN'T 
CALL THIS ONE OF
HIS FAVORITE 
VENUES.
A GREAT PLAY BY 
BLUM, THE THROW 
IS IN TIME TO 
GET HIM!
WE WILL LOOK 
BACK ON THAT 
PLAY AND KNOW 
HOW BIG IT IS!
MAN!
MARK: YOU KNOW 
WHAT, MATTY?
FROM MY VANTAGE 
POINT I THINK 
THE PADRES 
CAUGHT A BREAK.
FROM THE LEFT 
SIDE, GARY 
MATTHEWS CAN RUN
A LITTLE BIT.
HE GETS 
SOMETHING UP, HE
TOPS IT, AND NOW
THE RACE IS ON.
BLUM HAS TO 
FIELD IT ON THE 
RUN, THROW, 
VERY, VERY 
CLOSE.
MATT: I'LL TELL 
YOU WHO MADE 
THAT HAPPEN, A 
GREAT EFFORT BY 
BLUM, NO 
QUESTION, BUT 
ADRIAN GOT OUT 
THERE AS FAR AS 
HE COULD STARTED
TO MOVE THE 
GLOVE EARL 
ENOUGH TO HELP 
SELL THE CALL.
AND THERE IS 1 
HUGE OUT TO 
START THE LAST 
OF THE 9TH.
NOW MICHAEL 
YOUNG.
YOUNG SINGLED 
AND SCORED IN 
THE 5TH.
AGAIN, THESE TWO
HITTERS, 
SPEAKING OF 
YOUNG AND MARK 
TEIXEIRA ON 
DECK, HAVE NEVER
FACED TREVOR 
HOFFMAN.
1-1.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
HAS MADE HIS 
PRESENCE FELT 
TONIGHT 2 FOR 4 
WITH AN R.B.I. 
AND FANTASTIC 
DEFENSE.
MARK: I 
MENTIONED LATE 
IN THE BALL GAME
THAT THE PITCHER
WILL TRY TO KEEP
THE BALL A 
WACHLT BELIEVE 
IT.
WITH THESE 
HITTERS, THE 
RANGERS, YOU CAN
KEEP IT AWAY BUT
YOU BETTER KEEP 
IT DOWN.
THEY CAN GO OUT 
AND INTO SOME 
FIELD ON YOU IF 
YOU DON'T.
MATT: 1-2.
A BOUNCING BALL 
UP THE MIDDLE, 
THAT ONE IS 
GOING TO GET 
BUY.
TYING RUN 
ABOARD, THE 
WINNING RUN 
STEPS TO THE 
PLATE.
WELL NOW WITHOUT
QUESTION YOU'RE 
INTO THE 
SCARIEST PART OF
THE RANGERS LINE
UP.
YOUNG HAS 
SINGLED, AND NOW
YOU GOT MARK 
TEIXEIRA, AND 
SAVE A DOUBLE 
PLAY, YOU'RE 
GOING TO HAVE TO
DEAL WITH 
BLALOCK AS WELL.
MARK: MENTIONED 
HIGH, FASTBALL 
HITTERS, LOVE TO
SWING THE BAT.
HOW DO YOU TAKE 
THE STING OUT?
THE BIG KEY FOR 
TREVOR IS 
GETTING AHEAD 
0-1 WITH A 
FASTBALL AND 
THEN YOU CAN 
PLAY GAMES WITH 
THEM WITH A 
CHANGE-UP.
MATT: WELL THE 
GOOD NEWS ON 
TEIXEIRA'S LINE 
IS IS THAT HE 
HAS GROUNDED 
INTO 10 DOUBLE 
PLAYS, AND ONLY 
YOUNG HAS 
GROUNDED INTO 
MORE.
2-0 NOW.
EACH ROSTER IS 
UP ON THE TOP 
STEP IN THIS 
ONE, A ONE-RUN 
BALL GAME, END 
OF THE 9TH.
MARK: LOOKS LIKE
A WORLD SERIES 
GAME, DOESN'T 
IT?
MATT: THROWING 
CABBAGE AROUND 
THE DUGOUT.
IF THAT'S 
FAIR -- IT'S A 
FOUL BALL.
AN EMPHATIC CALL
BY FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE.
MARK: DID YOU 
SEE MARK 
TEIXEIRA RAISE 
HIS WARMS IN THE
BOX?
MATT: I DIDN'T 
SEE THAT ONE 
BEING THAT 
CLOSE.
HERE COMES BUCK 
SHOWALTER.
MARK: NOT FROM 
MY VANTAGE 
POINT, NO.
MATT:

MATT: THAT'S -- 
MARK: IT'S TOUGH
TO TELL, BECAUSE
OF WHERE THE 
BALL LANDS.
NOW, A 
STRAIGHT-ON 
SHOT, HE SAYS 
DEFINITELY IT'S 
GONE.
MATT: BUCK 
SHOWALTER STILL 
OUT THERE 
SHOUTING WITH 
BILL WELKIE.
MARK: THEY GOING
TO ASK FOR HELP?
MATT: NO.
HOW DOES THE 
THIRD BASE 
UMPIRE HELP THE 
FIRST BASE 
UMPIRE ON THAT 
BALL?
I MEAN THE HOME 
PLATE UMPIRE, 
MAYBE, BUT HE'S 
CALLING THIRD 
BASE UMPIRE 
MARTY FOSTER AND
THE WHOLE CREW 
IS GOING TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ONE.
IF THEY CHAVENG 
THE CALL YOU'RE 
GOING TO HAVE A 
VISITING TEAM 
ERUPT.
FOUL BALL.
MARK: THE ONLY 
WAY YOU'RE GOING
TO TELL IF 
THAT'S FAIR OR 
FOUL IS IF YOU 
HAVE A CAMERA 
DIRECTLY IN LINE
BEHIND HOME 
PLATE DOWN THE 
FIRST BASELINE.
MATT: BOY, HE 
HIT THE SNOT OUT
OF THAT BALL, 
DIDN'T HE?
MARK: YEAH, DE.
MATT: LORD!
ALL RIGHT.
2 BALLS AND A 
STRIKE.
AFTER A 600 FOOT
FOUL BALL FROM 
MARK TEIXEIRA.
2-2.
MARK: GOING 
BACK, HE SOLD 
THAT ONE, DIDN'T
HE?
HE WAS GOING 
DOWN THE FIRST 
BASELINE PUMPING
HIS FISTS.
MATT: I THINK 
THAT WAS 
SINCERE.
MARK: I THINK IT
WAS, TOO.
MATT: POPPED HIM
UP.
MATT: WELL, 
MARK, THEY SAY 
IT'S A GAME OF 
ISSUES.
MARK: THE ONLY 
OTHER WAY TO 
TELL IS IF THAT 
FOUL POLE IS 
EXTENDED 
ANOTHER, WHAT, 
20 FEET IN THE 
AIR?
THAT FOUL POLE 
IS UP THERE, 
MATTY.
HOW TALL IS 
THAT?
50, 60 FEET, 80 
FEET, 90 FEET?
MATT: IT'S TALL.
HANK BLALOCK 
NOW.
MODERN DAY 
MURDERERS' ROW, 
AND TREVOR 
TRYING TO HOLD 
IT TO A 9TH 
INNING SINGLE TO
TOLD TO A SAVE, 
HERE.
1-1.
THERE ARE
OPPORTUNITIES 
AND THERE ARE 
SAVE 
OPPORTUNITIES.
MARK: AGAINST A 
TEAM LIKE THIS, 
YEAH.
MATT: THIS ONE 
SHOULD BE WORTH 
10 OR 15 ROLAIDS
RELIEF POINTS.
[CHUCKLES] 1-2.
HOFFMAN TRYING 
TO SAVE IT FOR 
MIKE THOMPSON.
POPPED INTO FOUL
TERRITORY, VINNY
GIVING CHASE, 
BOWEN SLIDES AND
HANK BLALOCK 
WILL HAVE 
ANOTHER CHANCE.
TREVOR 1 STRIKE 
A FWRA HIS 17TH 
SAVE, MIKE 
THOMPSON IS 1 
STRIKE AWAY FROM
HIS THIRD WIN 
AND BRUCE BOCHY 
IS 1 STRIKE AWAY
FROM CAREER 
VICTORY NO. 900.
INTO CENTER 
FIELD, PLAYABLE 
FOR CAMERON.
AND THAT WILL DO
IT.
SAN DIEGO TAKES 
THE FIRST IN THE
SERIES IN 
ARLINGTON, A 6-5
VICTORY OVER THE
HEAVY-HITTING 
RANGERS.
THE WIN FOR 
THOMPSON, THE 
SAVE FOR 
HOFFMAN, AND 
MILLER LITE 
PLAYER OF THE 
GAME HONORS FOR 
MIKE CAMERON.
MIKE'S SECOND 
HOME RUN OF THE 
ROAD TRIP.
MIKE CAMERON'S 
LONG BALL, ONE 
OF 2 FOR SAN 
DIEGO TONIGHT AS
EX-RANGER ADRIAN
GONZALEZ ALSO 
MERITS 
CONSIDERATION.
A GOOD OVERALL EFFORT BY THE 
PADRES TONIGHT.
IT'S TURNING INTO A FINE ROAD 
TRIP THROUGH THE AMERICAN LEAGUE
WEST AS SAN DIEGO WINS IT, 6-5 
PADRES.
MUD AND I RETURN AFTER THIS.
MARK: TIME FOR THE PLAYS OF THE 
GAME BROUGHT TO YOU BY MURRAY 
LAMPERT CONSTRUCTION.

MARK: YEAH.
MATT: IT WAS THE RANGERS THAT 
DREW FIRST MROOD.
HANK BLALOCK SINGLED, TO BRING 
IN MARK TEIXEIRA, 1-NOTHING 
RANGERS.
SAN DIEGO GOT IT BACK AS AN 
EX-RANGER STRUCK, ADRIAN 
GONZALEZ THE FIRST TO GO INTO 
DOUBLE DIGITS, HIS 10TH OF THE 
YEAR.
TOP OF THE 5TH, SAN DIEGO GOT 2 
ON A PIAZZA SINGLE, FRIARS LEAD 
3-1, BUT THE RANGERS WOULD GET 
THE LEAD BACK IN THE BOTTOM.
THE LEAD FLIP-FLOPPED TONIGHT ON
3 OCCASIONS.
TIES AT 3 BY ROD BARAJAS, 
JOHNSON DROVE IN GREENE TO TIE 
IT IN THE 6TH, AND THEN THE 
2-RUN HOME RUN BY MIKE CAMERON 
AND THE RANGERS GOT 1 GABBING TO GRAB TO 
MAKE IT 6-5.
MUD AND I ARE BACK TO WRAP IT UP
AFTER THIS.
MATT: FINAL GAME SUMMARY AS

MIKE CAMERON, TWO FORMER
ALL-STARS WITH POSTSEASON
EXPERIENCE, ARE NOW, ADDING
SPEED AND SIZZLE TO THE
SAN DIEGO PADRES OUTFIELD
AND LINEUP.
BOTH HAVE ALSO REBOUNDED
FROM SERIOUS INJURIES.
NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY GOT
LUCKY, BUT BECAUSE THEIR
POSITIVE ENERGY HAS HELPED
FUEL THEIR FIRE, TO GET,
BACK IN THE GAME.
ERIC YOUNG IS, SIMPLY
ELECTRIC.
HUSTLING IN THE OUTFIELD OR
ON THE BASE PATHS, HE SHOWED
LITTLE SIGN OF SLOWING DOWN

NEW BRUNSWICK NEW JERSEY
ERE HE WATCH AD LOT OF
SPORTS ON TV.
>> FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL,
BASEBALL I WANTED TO EMULATE
THE PLAYER AND DO SOME OF
THE THINGS HE WAS DOING ON
TV.
>> WHO WERE SOME OF THE
PLAYERS YOU TRIED TO
EMULATE?
>> MORE SO, WILLIE RANDOLPH.
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE.
I LIKE THE WAY WILLIE
CARRIED HIMSELF.
>> PLAYING BASEBALL FIRST
WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
WITH NO LITTLE LEAGUE FOR
HIM TWO BROTHERS AND SISTER.
>> GROWING UP I THOUGHT I
WAS IN A RICH NEIGHBORHOOD.
I GOT EVERYTHING I WANTED.
WHICH WASN'T A LOT BUT WE GO
THE, CLOTHES HAD A ROOF.
WE HAD FOOD, THAT'S THE WAY
YOU SUPPOSED TO LIVE.
BUT WE WERE THE LOW INCOME
NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND AS WE CALL IT THE
GHETTO.
>> ONCE JOINED ORGANIZED
SPORTS AT TEN HE WOULD BE
CONSISTENT MVP OF TEAMS AND
TOURNAMENTS FROM.
A WORKING CLASS FAMILY, HIS
PARENTS OFTEN TOLD HIM --
>> THERE IS SOMEONE OUT
THERE ALWAYS BETTER THAN
YOU.
I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE
BETTER THAN ME.
>> A TEACHER ENCOURAGED HIM
TO SWITCH TO A PRIVATE
CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
>> SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I
STAY ON RIGHT TRACK.
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK
BEING IN THE GHETTO, OR
GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD
HAVE DETERRED ME AT ALL.
I JUST HAD A MISSION ON MY
MIND.
AT THAT PARTICULAR STAGE OF
MY LIFE AND, I WASN'T GOING
TO LET ANYTHING OR ANYONE
GET IN BETWEEN US.
>> WHAT WAS YOUR MISSION?
>> WAS GOING TO BE
SUCCESSFUL.
I WAS GIVEN A GOD-GIVEN
TALENT.
I WAS GOING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT.

>> HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT
THAT OFF-SEASON.
>> BUT FOR HIS SON?
>> OH, YEAH.
>> SENIOR YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLFRIEND.
PAT ERIC, JR..
>> I WANT EVERYBODY TO
UNDERSTAND APPRECIATE TOOK A
REAL MAN TO STEP UP AT AGE
18 AND RAISE A SON TO
FINALLY, HAVE HIM FOLLOW IN
YOUR FOOTSTEPS IS PROBABLY
DREAM COME TRUE FOR HIM.
A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE
RAN FROM THAT SITUATION.
YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE AND
LOVE FOR HIM DOING THAT FOR
ME.
NOT LEAVING ME AND STILL,
CONTINUING HIS DREAM AS, HE
HAS GONE THROUGH BASEBALL
BEING THERE FOR ME AS I GREW
UP.
>> NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET
ME EMOTIONAL TALKING ABOUT
MY SON.
OKAY.
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO
YOU, TO HEAR HIM RECOGNIZE
HOW IMPORTANT, THAT IS TO
HIM?
HE SAYS SOME THINGS ON
CAMERA AND IN INTERVIEWS
SURPRISE ME SOMETIMES.
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALLY
SAY IT TO ME.
BUT, HE'S A SPECIAL KID.
HE'S A SPECIAL KID.
>> WHAT WAS THAT IN YOU THAT
MADE YOU WANT TO BE
COMMITTED?
>> I JUST REMEMBER MY DAD
SAYING TO ME, YOU KNOW WHAT?
OKAY, IT'S HAPPENED.
YOU JUST GOT TO BECOME A MAN
FASTER THAN YOU WANTED TO.
I WILL BE THERE EVERY DAY TO
HELP YOU THROUGH.
WHEN HE SAID THAT TO ME,
THAT TALK, THAT FATHER-SON
TALK I KNEW EVERYTHING WAS
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE
IT ALL RIGHT.
>> SO AT RUTGERS HE PLAYED
FOOTBALL, REQUIRED BY HIS
SCHOLARSHIP AND BASEBALL,
BECAUSE HE LOVED IT.
>> MY FIRST AT-BAT I HIT A
HOMERUN.
THEN CAME UP THE NEXT TIME.
I HIT ANOTHER HOME RUN.
I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE
THAT WAS MY CALLING.
>> AS A STANDOUT BASEBALL
SCOUTS SHOWED INTEREST.
>> THEY HELD OFF BECAUSE THE
FACT I WAS GOING BACK FOR MY
SENIOR YEAR IN FOOTBALL THAT
I WAS MORE COMMITTED TO
FOOTBALL THAT I WANTED TO
PLAY FOOTBALL.
ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK
ME, TAKE ME AWAY FROM THIS.
>> HE WOULD GRADUATE FROM
RUTGERS IN FOUR YEARS WITH
HIS NAME IN THE FOOTBALL AND
BASEBALL RECORD BOOKS.
A BUSINESS MANAGEMENT DEGREE.
AND AS THE LOS ANGELES
DODGERS DRAFT PICK IN THE
43rd ROUND.
DETERMINED HE WAS BETTER
THAN THAT HE WORKED SEVEN
DAYS A WEEK AT ROOKIE BALL
IN FLORIDA.
>> SUNDAY WAS OFF DAY BUT IT
WASN'T AN OFF DAY FOR ME.
BECAUSE, ME AND COACHES
WOULD GET OUT THERE AND TAKE
THOUSANDS OF GROUND BALLS.
I JUST REMEMBER THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S HOT.
SWEATING.
TIRED.
I DIDN'T NEVER THINK ABOUT
THAT.
I KEPT THINKING I GOT TO GET

I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT, THE
PEOPLE MADE ME BELIEVE IT.

INTO THE PLAYOFFS IN 1995.
AND THEN 1996, BACK AT
SECOND BASE.
>> THAT WAS MY BEST YEAR.
WHEN EVERYTHING CAME
TOGETHER.
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
>> A BASE STEALING MACHINE,
A NATIONAL LEAGUE HIGH OF
53.
AND BEING THE SECOND MODERN
DAY PLAYER TO HAVE A 6-STEAL
GAME, ALL WORTH THINKING
BEING NAMED AN ALL-STAR.
>> WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID,
INTRODUCE, TIPPING HAT AND
WEARING THEIR NICE SHOES AND
EVERYTHING.
SO I ENJOYED THAT AND
TURNING DOUBLE PLAY WHICH
WAS HIS LAST ALL-STAR GAME.
>> WITH A TRADE BACK TO THE
DODGERS IN '98, HE WAS THE
TOUGHEST BATTER TO STRIKE
OUT IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE
IN '99.
KNOWING HIS GOAL, WAS JUST
TO GET ON BASE.
>> USE THESE LEGS.
THAT WAS MY JOB.
>> HE ACT SELLED AT THAT
WITH THE CHICAGO CUBS.
THE MILWAUKEE BREWERS, BY
2003 WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO
GIANTS.
REUNITED WITH HIS OFF-SEASON
WORKOUT FRIEND, BARRY BONDS.
>> HE'S AN INSPIRATION TO
ALL THE OTHER GUYS.
I TRY TO TELL HIM BEFORE
WE'RE WORKING OUT, SAID YOU
KNOW, YOU STAND NEXT TO ME.
WE'RE IN LINEUP PEOPLE WILL
THINK I'M THE BETTER ATHLETE
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
AND YOU CAN GIVE A LOT TO A
LOT OF PEOPLE.
SHOW SIZE DOESN'T MATTER.
>> WITH AGE COMES AT
JUSTMENTS.
SIGNING WITH TEXAS IN 2004
AS UTILITY PLAYER.
>> CALLED SUPER UTILITY.

INJURY AND ILLNESS SUDDENLY
MEANT HE WAS STARTING
CENTERFIELDER OPENING DAY.
>> IT WAS FUNNY.
I REMEMBER, 3-2, JASON BAY.
BOOM.
THAT'S ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT,
GOING TO GET IT.
I GOT IT.
I PAID FOR IT.
>> WE HOPE THAT SHOULDER IS
OKAY.
>> RATHER THAN SURGERY AND
BEING OUT FOR A YEAR, TOO
LONG AT THIS STAGE IN HIS
CAREER, HE TOOK HIS CHANCES
WITH INTENSE REHAB.
RETURNING SOONER THAN
EXPECTED.
>> REACTIVATED TO, PLAY
TONIGHT.
ERIC YOUNG.
>> YOUNG WAS A BIG PART OF
THE SECOND HALF.
AND THE PADRES, DIVISION

AS IT TAKES MY SON TO TAKE
TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES.
THAT'S HOW MANY YEARS I HAVE
LEFT, YES.
>> ONE WAY TO STAY IN SHAPE
FOR NOW.
A ROUTINE FAR FROM THE
BRIGHT LIGHTS AND BASE PATHS
OF THE DIAMOND.
IT'S OFF-SEASON AND
OCCASIONAL IN SEASON YOGA

IT WAS DEFINITELY, A GREAT
DECISION.

>> IF HE AND HIS SON COULD
WRITE THE END OF EY'S MAJOR
LEAGUE STORY IT WOULD START
WITH TWO OF THEM BEING ON
SAME TEAM.
>> I WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO

US ONE DAY IN THE BIG
LEAGUES TOGETHER.
THEN THEY CAN RELEASE ME AND
GIVE HIM THE SPOT.
>> PROBABLY BAT LEAD OFF.
HE WILL BAT SECOND.
FIRST AND SECOND WE PULL OFF
A DOUBLE STEAL.
>> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
>> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
>> BASEBALL ISN'T USUALLY
CONSIDERED A CONTACT SPORT
BUT IN THOSE RARE AND OFTEN
DRAMATIC IT MOMENTS WHEN
PASSION AND SPEED, MEET A

RESULTS ARE OFTEN
DEVASTATING.
MIKE CAMERON KNOWS THAT ALL

EVEN MORE SO NOW THAN, YOU
KNOW, THINGS THAT WENT
THROUGH, TO, PLAY THE GAME.
YOU KNOW, JUST TO PLAY.
LOT OF GUYS, HAVE SURGERIES
AND INJURIES, THEY'RE NOT
ALLOWED, JUST DON'T ALLOW
THEM TO COME BACK.

IN PETCO PARK.
>> IT WILL SCORE BELTRAN.
>> CAMERON WAS THE RIGHT
FIELDER FOR THE NEW YORK
METS.
NOT HIS NATURAL POSITION.
HE HAD BEEN MOVED TO RIGHT
BECAUSE THE METS HAD BROUGHT
IN CARLOS BELTRAN TO PLAY
CENTER.
CAMERON HAD STEADILY BEEN
MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT BY
AUGUST 11th.
THEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE
7th --
>> BALL OVER IN RIGHT
CENTER.
THOUGHT I HAD THE BALL.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I GOT,
HIT BY A FREIGHT TRAIN.
>> OH.
WHAT A TERRIBLE COLLISION.
>> OH, BOY.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M
AT.
MY MIND WAS, PUZZLED.
I'M DAZED.
I HAVE NO IDEA BUT I DO KNOW
THAT, ONLY THING I KNOW I'M
ALIVE.
D BUT, I CAN'T MOVE.
MY BODY WON'T MOVE.
>> THIS IS BAD AS COLLISION
I'VE SEEN.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THE EXTENT
OF THE DAMAGE OR ANYTHING
ELSE LIKE THAT.
I JUST KNEW THAT, WHY DIDN'T
I CATCH THE BALL.
THEY KEPT ME PINNED DOWN ON
MY BACK LONGEST.
TRYING TO MOVE MY LEGS
KNOWING I CAN GET ON MY SIDE
TO BREATHE.
BECAUSE I CAN'T.
I'M CHOKING.
BLOOD.
AND, FINALLY, I THINK, ONCE
TRAINER REY RAMIREZ CAME OUT
THERE, TURNED ME ON MY SIDE.
THEY FOUND OUT MY NECK WAS
BROKEN OR WHATEVER.
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE.
I WANT TO GET UP.
I WANT TO GET UP AND LOOK
AROUND AND MY BODY, I WANT
TO SEE MYSELF.
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS
OKAY.
BUT THEY DON'T LET ME GET
UP.
BOTH OF MY LIPS SPLIT.
MY JAW IS UNHINGED A LITTLE
BIT.
MY FACE IS BURNING.
EXTENSIVELY.
I HAD A HEADACHE, OUT OF
THIS WORLD.
BUT I WAS CALM THOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY UNTIL I GOT
IN AMBULANCE THEY STARTED
CUTTING MY CLOTHE OFF.
THEY ONLY DO THAT WHEN THERE
IS SOMETHING SERIOUS.
I WAS REAL SERIOUSLY IN
DISTRESS INSIDE BECAUSE I
KNEW THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN
THEY TOOK ME OFF THE FIELD
THAT MAY BE MY LAST TIME
GOING BACK ON A BASEBALL
FIELD.
>> HOW HE WOULD EVENTUALLY
DEAL WITH HIS INJURIES IS
ROOTED IN HIS HISTORY.
A GUY ABLE TO ADAPT AND
BOUNCE BACK, EVEN AS A QUIET,
YET ADVENTEROUS KID.
>> JUMPING OFF BACK OF THE
HOUSE.
JUMPING, BICYCLES.
TRYING EVERYTHING.
>> BORN MICHAEL TERRANCE

GEORGIA WHERE HE FIRST
PLAYED BASEBALL IN HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD AT SIX.
>> I WAS KIND OF LIKE A
LITTLE GUY IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE WHOLE THING BUT I COULD
RUN.
I COULD DO EVERYTHING.
>> EVEN THOUGH HIS PARENTS
WERE IN HIS LIFE HE AND HIS
BROTHERS AND SISTERS SPENT A
LOT OF TIME AT GRANDMA
FANNIE MAE'S HOUSE AFTER HIS
GRANDFATHER DIED, SHE
ADOPTED YOUNG MIKE.
WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM HER?
>> HARD WORK.
I MEAN, JUST DEDICATION.
AND SHE WAS LIKE A, YOU KNOW,
MOST SOUND PERSON IN OUR
FAMILY.
>> TOUGHENED UP FROM PLAYING
FOOTBALL HE PREFERRED
BASEBALL WHICH MIGHT HAVE
BEEN HIS TICKET TO COLLEGE.
BUT HE COULDN'T PASS UP THE
CHICAGO WHITE SOX WHO
DRAFTED HIM OUT OF HIGH
SCHOOL IN THE 18th ROUND.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS
PRETTY DID I TO DO IT BUT
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
>> JUST FOUR YEARS LATER
MADE HIS MAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT,
EXCITING FOR HIM AND HIS
FAMILY.
>> I WAS LIVING SOME PARTS
OF THEIR DREAM.
I FINALLY MADE IT TO BE THE,
PLAYER THAT THEY THOUGHT I
COULD BE BUT I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW YET.
>> AS A TOP PROSPECT HE
STARTED NEXT SEASON IN AAA.
BUT ONCE CALLED UP AGAIN, HE
STEPPED UP.
>> WHOA BOY.
MIKE CAMERON.
>> FINISHING 6th IN THE
AMERICAN LEAGUE ROOKIE OF
THE YEAR BALLOTING.
AFTER STRUGGLING HIS
SOPHOMORE YEAR THE WHITE SOX
TRADED HIM IN NIPT NINE TO

TRADED TO SEATTLE IN 2000.
THAT WAS PRETTY HIGH-PROFILE
DEAL WITH KEN GRIFFEY, JR.,
PART OF THAT MIX.
>> GOING FOR THE GUY
PROBABLY BEST PLAYER IN THE
LEAGUE FOR LONGEST.
>> THE TEAM'S ADVICE?
>> BE YOURSELF.
DO WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF
DOING.
>> AS PART OF THE
SENSATIONAL MARINER SEASON

>> HE DOES IT AGAIN.
>> EARNING FIRST OF TWO GOLD
BLOFS.
PICKED AS AN ALL-STAR IN,
2002 AGAINST HIS FORMER
WHITE SOCKS HIT FOUR
CONSECUTIVE HOME RUNS.
FIRST TIME THAT HAD BEEN
DONE IN THE AMERICAN LEAGUE
SINCE 1959.
>> FEEL LIKE I HAD SOMETHING
TO PROVE TO THEM ALL THE
TIME.
I DIDN'T KNOW THE REASON WHY
I WAS TRADED FROM THERE.
>> AS FREE AGENT AND SEATTLE
NOT AN OPTION CAMERON SIGNED
WITH THE NEW YORK METS.
>> I THOUGHT I WAS READY FOR
IT.
>> YOU WEREN'T?
>> WELL, YOU DON'T QUITE,
PREPARE FOR, EVERYTHING THAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN THERE.
>> WITH HIS FIRST SERIOUS
INJURY, A TORN TENDON IN HIS
HAND, AND WITH SEVERAL
PLAYERS ALREADY ON THE
DISABLED LIST --
>> I COULDN'T ALLOW MYSELF
TO GO ON THE DL I STRUGGLED
WITH THE GAME OF BASEBALL.
I WAS GETTING PLACE ERRED.
I WAS GETTING BOOED AT HOME.
IT WAS EVERYTHING.
I NEVER GOT BOOED AT HOME
BEFORE.
AND, IT WAS A GOOD
EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
IT WAS CHARACTER BUILDING
SITUATION FOR MYSELF AS A
MAN.
>> EVEN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE,
HE BROKE THE MET'S HOME RUN
RECORD FOR CENTERFIELDERS.
BECAME THE 11th PLAYER IN
METS HISTORY TO HIT 30 HOME
RUNS.
>> THOUGHT I HAD CROSSED THE
BRIDGE IN NEW YORK CITY AND
EVERYTHING.
BUT, THERE WAS MORE TO COME.
I MEAN THERE WAS MORE TO
COME.
>> WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO
AUGUST 2005, THE COLLISION
AND 6 1/2 HOUR SURGERY.
>> LOWER HALF OF MY FACE,
HAD TO BE RECONNECTED TO MY,
MY SOCKETS AND STUFF BACK
TOGETHER.
I WAS REALLY FEARING THE
FACT THAT I WAS GOING NOT BE
ABLE TO SEE.
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE,
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT?
>> YEAH A LITTLE BIT.
I WOULD SAY A LITTLE BIT.
THROUGHOUT HERE IS, IT'S ALL
LIKE PLATES.
I GUESS, IT TOOK A LONG TIME
FOR THIS STUFF TO SETTLE IN.
THESE THINGS HERE TO SETTLE
IN AND EVERYTHING.
MY EYES ARE KIND OF, GOT,
MAYBE ONE OF THEM IS NOT,
QUITE AS, LIKE THE OTHER
ONE.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF CUTS AND
SCARS.
I GOT SCREWS IN HERE.
YOU KNOW.
JUST CUT ME ON THE TOP OF MY
LIP, LIKE FACE-OFF.
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, -- IT WAS
A -- PRETTY, PRETTY GYRATING
EXPERIENCE I GUESS.
AND, I DIDN'T KNOW IF I
COULD GO BACK AND PLAY RIGHT
FIELD AGAIN.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD DO
IT.

LIGHTING THINGS UP TONIGHT.
>> HE APPRECIATES
SAN DIEGO'S BEACHES WHERE HE
OFTEN REFLECTS ON HIS
RECOVERY AND HIS SISTER'S

GRANTED.
>> HE MISSES HIS WIFE AND
THREE CHILDREN WHO WILL
VISIT FROM GEORGIA IN THE
SUMMER.
.
>> TELL ME ABOUT YOUR
WRITING, WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
>> IT STARTED OUT BEING A
SECRET.
I GUESS IT'S NO LONGER A
SECRET NO MORE.
HAVING SOME POSITIVE
THOUGHTS IN MY MIND I WANT
TO PUT ON PAPER.
MY SWING, SO GRACEFUL AS A
WILLOW TREE.
SO QUICK AS A COBRA STRIKE.
>> KNOWING WHAT'S POSSIBLE
NOW, THAT TYPE OF INJURY,
WHY DID YOU WANT TO COME
BACK?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I THINK I NEEDED TO COME
BACK JUST FOR THE SAKE I
ALWAYS CAME BACK THROUGH
EVERYTHING.
AND, I DON'T THINK THERE WAS
A PARTICULAR REASON WHY I
COULDN'T.
SMOOTH LIKE THE OCEAN ON A
PEACEFUL NIGHT.
YES YET SO POWERFUL AND
THUNDEROUS AS WAVE CRASHING
INTO LAND NOT ONLY FOR BUT
MY LITTLE ONE TOSS SHOW A
LITTLE BIT, THEY SAW ME GO
THROUGH EVERYTHING TOO.
THEY SAW ALL OF THOSE
DIFFERENT DAYS THAT I HAD TO
GO THROUGH AND, COULDN'T HE
SEE.
COULDN'T EAT.
LOSING A LOT OF WEIGHT.
TO GET, MY STRENGTH BACK, TO
GET BACK ON WHAT I ALWAYS
DO.
I JUST, I THINK IT WAS A
GOOD, GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR
ME TO SHOW THEM THAT, YOU GO
THROUGH CERTAIN THINGS IN
LIFE, THERE'S A LOT OF
DIFFERENT OBSTACLES IN LIFE
THAT WE GO THROUGH.
AS HUMAN BEINGS.
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO LIVE
THROUGH IT, THEN IT'S ONLY
GOING TO MAKE YOU STRONGER.
>> MY SWING, MY SWING, CAN
YOU FEEL IT?
MY SWING.
>> MIKE CAMERON AND ERIC
YOUNG HAVE CHALKED UP SOME
SOLID NUMBERS BECAUSE OF
THEIR TENACITY AND ALL-OUT
PLAY.
SERIOUS INJURIES SHOWED THEM
HOW QUICKLY THE GAME CAN BE
TAKEN AWAY.
AT THIS STAGE IN THEIR
CAREERS THINGS THAT
CERTAINLY MATTER TO THEM,
DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
AND DON'T HOLD BACK.
I'M JANE MITCHELL.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
"ONE-ON-ONE".

SAN DIEGO FOR MORE EXCITING
UNIQUE LOCAL PROGRAMING.

JOHN: ON A NIGHT WHEN THE DALLAS
MAVS ARE CENTER STAGE, WE COME 
TO YOU FROM THE HOME OF THE 
TEXAS RANGERS, IN PREPARATION 
FOR THE FIRST OF THREE BETWEEN 
THE PADRES AND RANGERS, HERE ON 
CHANNEL 4.
WELCOME BACK.
THE NBA FINALS ON EVERYBODY'S 
MINDS TONIGHT.
WE'LL SEE HOW IT AFFECTS THE 
CROWD AT THE BASEBALL PARK.
BUT THE PADRES HAVE BEEN HERE A 
COUPLE DAYS ARRIVING IN 
ARLINGTON ON SUNDAY.
MARK: BRUCE BOCHY LIKES TO GET 
AK
ACCLIMATED TO THE CITY YOU'RE 
GOING TO BE PLAYING IN.
MATT: THIS MAY BE A MILESTONE 
NIGHT FOR BOCH.
MARK: INTO HIS 12TH YEAR AS 
SKIPPER FOR THE PADRES, 899 IS 
THE NUMBER, ALOU, AND CHANCE, 
BUT THIS TELLS YOU ONE THING.
THE CONSISTENCY OF BRUCE BOCHY, 
THERE IS A LOT OF FACTORS THAT 
GO INTO WHY HE HAS 899 WINS.
HE'S GOOD WITH THE PRESS, HE'S 
GOOD WITH THE FANS, WE'RE 
ROOTING FOR BOCH.
MATT: SOME OF THOSE TEAMS HAVE 
BEEN GOOD SINCE HIS TENURE, AND 
IT'S A CREDIT FOR HIM TO HAVE 
WON THAT MANY GAMES IN THE BIG 
LEAGUES AND HE'S DONE IT WITH 
MANY COACHES ON HIS STAFF OVER 
THE YEARS. WHEN WE COME BACK, 
MUD SITS DOWN WITH THE LATEST 
ADDITION, NEW/RETURNING HITTING 
COACH MERV SITS DOWN WITH HIM 
AFTER THIS.
MARK: WELCOME BACK TO TEXAS, AND
FOR A FEW MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO
TALK WITH THE HITTING COACH MERV
RETTENMUND.
MARV, YOU WORE THE BLUE, AND THE
OTHER COLORS, AND ARE YOU GLAD 
TO BE BACK?
>> IT'S THE ONLY PLACE I WOULD 
HAVE TAKEN THE JOB.
IEMENT MOST SHOCKED PERSON, AND 
WHEN THEY CALLED IT WAS A HECK 
OF AN OPPORTUNITY.
IF I FELT BAD ABOUT ANYTHING, IT
WAS DAVE MAGADAN LOSING HIS JOB 
AND I CONSIDER HIM A GOOD 
FRIEND.
MARK: YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS AND 
IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST 
UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS IN ALL OF 
BASEBALL.
YOU HATE GETTING RELEASED, AND 
IT'S PART OF BASEBALL.
BUT YOU DID TALK TO HIM.
>> OH, YEAH, AND I WAS ON THE 
PHONE, HE UNDERSTANDS IT, IT'S 
BASEBALL, AND HE UNDERSTANDS 
THAT I DIDN'T CALL THE BALL CLUB
TO GET HIS JOB, BUT WHEN YOU 
HAVE A FEW PLAYERS GOING BAD AND
IT'S CONTAGIOUS, IT HAPPENS TO 
EVERYONE IN BASEBALL, AND THE 
FRONT OFFICE MAKES MOVES AND THE
COACHES AND THE MANAGERS ARE THE
PEOPLE THAT SUFFER.
MARK: YOU MENTIONED MAKING 
MOVES.
YOU'RE COMING HERE TO SAN DIEGO 
AS A HITTING COACH.
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THESE GUYS,
YOU'VE SEEN THEM ON TV.
IS THERE A PERIOD WHERE YOU HAVE
TO GET TO KNOW THEIR STROKE AND 
THEIR PERSONALITY?
>> I THINK THAT'S THE BIG ONE,
RIGHT THERE.
I'LL LEARN A HITTER'S STROKE IN 
ONE DAY AND IT TAKES LONGER THAN
THAT TO GET TO KNOW THE 
INDIVIDUAL AND THE
RESPOND TO THINGS.
A LOT OF TIMES I LIKE TO SAY 
THINGS THAT ARE OFF-COLOR, AND I
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW ME 
BEFORE I START DOING THAT.
WE HAD A NICE SERIES IN ANAHEIM,
WE HAD SOME QUALITY AT-BATS UP 
THERE, WE GOT THE PITCH COUNTS 
UP.
IF I WAS DOWN ON ONE THING, A 
LOT OF TIMES AHEAD IN THE COUNT 
WE CHASED PITCHES WE SHOULDN'T 
HAVE BEEN SWINGING AT.
MARK: YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT 
YOUR PHILOSOPHY IN THE PLANE, 
BUT GIVE THE PADRE FANS, BUT YOU
HAVE THREE POINTS THAT YOU LIKE 
TO TELL THE HITTERS TO HAVE GOOD
BALL GAMES AND GET AT-BATS.
>> I LIKE TO GET READY AND NONE 
OF THIS WILL SURPRISE TONY GWYNN
IF HE'S LISTENING.
I LIKE TO SEE THE BAT CENTERED 
OVER THEIR HEAD AND WAIT 70/30, 
AND A LONG FOLLOW-THROUGH.
AND IF YOU DO THESE THINGS YOU 
KEEP YOUR EYES YOUR HONOR 
CONTROL AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
BASEBALL SAY "THE EYES HAVE IT."
AND IT'S BALL, BRINGING THE BAT 
BACK TO YOU.
ANYTIME YOU SEE ONE OF OUR 
PLAYERS SWING AND THE EYES GOING
UP YOU KNOW THE BARREL OF THE 
BAT IS GOING DOWN AND MORE THAN 
LIKELY IT'S GOING TO BE A FOUL 
BALL.
MARK: TALK ABOUT HITTING IN THIS
BALLPARK AS OPPOSED TO OTHER 
BALLPARKS.
THE BALL HAS A TENDENCY TO FLY 
HERE.
I'M GUESSING YOU TELL THEM DON'T
TRY TO LIFT, IS THERE SOMEBODY 
YOU SAY, GOT TO KNOCK THAT OFF 
WHILE WE'RE HERE.
>> MARK, HOPEFULLY EVERYONE 
KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE 
CAGE.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO DO ANYTHING
DIFFERENT, BARREL IT UP, HARD TO
THE MIDDLE.
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR APPROACH.
IT DOESN'T MATTER THE BALLPARK 
YOU'RE PLAYING IN, YOU BARREL IT
UP, YOU HIT IT HARD TO THE 
MIDDLE, AND YOU TAKE YOUR 
CHANCES.
MARK: YOU LIKE THE DH?
IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.
ARE YOU A FAN OR NOT?
>> WHEN THEY PUT IT IN THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE NEEDED 
SOMETHING.
THEY NEEDED SOMETHING TO LIVEN 
IT UP.
I AM NOT A FAN OF IT, I DO LIKE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE BASEBALL BETTER,
BUT WE HAVE IT AND WE'RE STUCK 
WITH IT.
MARK: HOW ABOUT INTERLEAGUE 
PLAY?
I KNOW AT FIRST IT WAS NEAT TO 
GO TO OTHER BALLPARKS, BUT ARE 
YOU A FAN?
>> I LIKE IT IN TEXAS THE FANS 
WILL GET TO SEE CERTAIN PLAYERS 
THEY WOULD NEVER GET TO SEE AND 
I THINK WE PLAY TOO MANY GAMES.
AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANYONE.
AND IF YOU DREW 18 GAMES IN 
INTERLEAGUE AND YOU'RE PLAYING 
THE YANKEES, AND THE RED SOX OR 
THE BRAVES, AND ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE COIN YOU'RE PLAYING 
THREE LESSER CLUBS YOU'VE GOT A 
CHANCE TO MAKE UP FOUR OR FIVE 
GAMES.
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR IN 
THAT REGARD.
MARK: YOU MAKE YOUR HOME IN SAN 
DIEGO, DON'T YOU?
>> I LIVE 8 BLOCKS FROM THE 
STADIUM AND AFTER THE END OF THE
ROAD TRIP I'LL WALK HOME.
I LIKE THAT A LOT.
THAT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT, 
AND THE OTHER THING IS I HAVE 
TWO GRANDKIDS THAT WILL BE ABLE 
TO COME OUT TO THE BALLPARK AND 
SEE ME.
THAT'S EXCITING.
MARK: MERV, THANKS FOR YOUR 
TIME.
GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
>> MARK, YOU WERE ONE OF THE 
OTHER REASONS.
MARK: SOUNDS GOOD.
MORE TO COME FROM ARLINGTON, 
RANGERS AND FRIARS AFTER THIS.

>> THE TEXAS RANGERS CAN FLAT 
OUT HIT.
THEY START A 3 GAME SERIES 
TONIGHT AGAINST A RANGER LINE UP
HITTING OVER 300 IN THE MONTH OF
JUNE.
TONIGHT RIGHT HANDER THOMPSON 
WILL SEE HOW THE OTHER HALF 
LIVES AND HE FACES AN AMERICAN 
LEAGUE OPPONENT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN HIS CAREER.
SAN DIEGO HOPING TO MUSCLE UP IN
THE A.L. WEST, GAME 1 OF THE 
SERIES, PADRES AND RANGERS, 
NEXT!
MATT: AMERICA WEST FIELD IN 
ARLINGTON, SITE OF THE 
INTERLEAGUE SERIES AS TONIGHT 
YOUR PADRES CONTEND WITH THE 
AMERICAN LEAGUE WESTERN DIVISION
LEADING TEXAS RANGERS.
WELCOME TO ARLINGTON FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN QUITE A WHILE BACK
ALONGSIDE MARK GRANT, MATT 
VASGERSIAN, THE RANGERS ARE HOT,
THEY CLAIMED A SHARE OF FIRST 
PLACE IN THE WEST.
THEY'RE DOING IT WITH BIG 
HITTING NUMBERS.
MARK: THIS IS A BALL CLUB THAT 
IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES THEY LEAD 
IN BATTING AVERAGE, THEY'RE 
SECOND, THEY'RE SECOND IN HITS, 
.461 HITTING PERCENTAGES ARE 
OUTSTANDING.
HOW DO THEY DO IT?
THEY DO IT PRETTY MUCH ALL THE 
WAY AROUND.
THEY HAVE POP IN THE LINE UP, 1 
THROUGH 9 SHOULD BE TOUGH.
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR THIS 
PITCHING STAFF.
MATT: A PADRES PITCHING STAFF 
THAT'S BEEN OUTSTANDING ON THE 
ROAD, AN ERA OF 3.81.
MARK: EVERYBODY IN BASEBALLS 
TALKS ABOUT PLAYING IT ON THE 
ROAD, AND WITH AN ERA OF 3.81, 
THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, MATTY?
MATT: KEEP THE BALL DOWN.
IT WILL BE UP TO THOMPSON AND 
VICENTE PADILLA TO SEE IF THEY 
CAN KEEP THEIR BALLS DOWN ON THE
ROAD HERE TONIGHT.
THOMPSON IS 7TH AS A MAJOR 
LEAGUER.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU ALONG WITH US.
THE STARTING LINE UP AND OPENING
PITCH, RANGERS AND FRIARS RIGHT 
AFTER THIS.
MATT: FORMERLY THE BALLPARK IN 
ARLINGTON, AMERICAQUEST FIELD, 
IT'S BEEN THE HOME OF THE 
RANGERS SINCE 1994 AND THE 
PADRES PAYING THEIR VISIT HERE 
IN SOME YEARS, AN UNINTERRUPTED 
HISTORY SINCE THE ADVENT OF 
INTERLEAGUE PLAY.
MANAGER BUCK SHOWALTER, HARD TO 
BELIEVE HE'S BEEN HERE FOR FOUR 
YEARS, AFTER TURNING AROUND A 
YANKEE PROGRAM, LAYING THE 
BLUEPRINT FOR A DIAMONDBACKS 
CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM, AND THE 
RANGERS DO CHECK IN TODAY WITH 
FIRST PLACE IN THE A.L. WEST.
MARK: BUCK SHOWALTER USED TO GO 
OVER VIDEO, SPENDING THE NIGHT 
IN THE CLUB HOUSE TO SCOUT A 
CERTAIN BALL TEAM. WE'LL SEE 
HOW THE SCOUTING HAS GONE 
AGAINST THESE PADRES AS THEY 
START OF THE FIRST GAME OF THE 
SERIES.
MATT: LET'S LOOK AT THE LINE UP.
CAMERON WILL LEAD OFF IN THE 
ABSENCE OF DAVE ROBERTS.
THAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE MOMENT.
IT WILL BE BLUM GETTING A START 
IN THE 2 HOLE, HIGHEST HE'S HIT 
ALL YEAR, HE'S AT SECOND.
GILES, PIAZZA, AND GONZALEZ, THE
FORMER RANGER, THEY MAKE OUT 3-5
PART OF THE LINE UP, BARD, 
GREENE, CASTILLA AND JOHNSON, 
RECENTLY RECALLED OUTFIELDER.
THEY ROUND THINGS OUT FOR THE 
PADRES HERE TONIGHT.
ON THE MOUN FOR THE RANGERS, 28 
YEAR OLD VETERAN RIGHT HANDER 
VICENTE PADILLA IN HIS FIRST 
YEAR AS A RANGER.
HE IS COMING OFF A WIN FROM THE 
WHITE SOX.
MARK: IT WAS A SEASON HIGH IN 
STRIKEOUTS FOR HIM AGAINST THAT 
TEAM.
HE WILL THROW 80 TO 90% 
FASTBALLS.
THE DEFENSE WILL WORK FOR HIM, 
HE THROWS A SLIDE SXER A CHANGE 
UP.
HE HAS TO RELY 
ON MOVEMENT.
MATT: WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT VICENTE 
PADILLA'S SPLITS
THAT ARE THINGS 
THAT CERTAINLY 
CATCH YOUR 
ATTENTION, 
INCLUDING THE 
FACT THAT HE HAS
BEEN MUCH, MUCH 
BETTER AT HOME 
IN WHAT'S 
LARGELY 
CONSIDERED A 
HITTERS BALLPARK
THAN HE HAS AWAY
FROM AMERICA 
QUEST FIELD.
4 AND 2 AND THE 
ERA HERE, AND 
WE'LL SEE WHAT 
HOME COOKIN HAS 
IN STORE FOR 
FIRST-YEAR 
RANGER VICENTE 
PADILLA TONIGHT 
AND BRUCE BOCHY 
PERHAPS 9 
INNINGS AWAY 
FROM CAREER WIN 
900.
MIKE CAMERON 
LEADS THINGS OFF
FOR SAN DIEGO.
MIKE CAMERON, 
BLUM AND GILES 
AS WE ARE SET 
FOR BASEBALL 
DOWN IN TEXAS 
TONIGHT.
AS WE MENTIONED,
IT'S NOT THE 
MOST WIDELY 
ATTENDED AFFAIR 
THAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO WATCH 
OUT OF THIS 
VENUE.
MARK: I THINK 
PEOPLE ARE MORE 
CONCERNED ABOUT 
A 3-SECOND LINE 
VIOLATION THAN A
3-RUN SHOT.
MATT: UNDERWAY 
AS VICENTE 
PADILLA'S FIRST 
PITCH IS FOULED 
BACK.
MIKE CAMERON HAD
HIS FOURTH HOME 
RUN OF THE YEAR,
AND THE FORMER 
PHILLIES PITCH 
MISSES OFF THE 
PLATE, 1-1.
THEY SHARE A 
FIRST PLACE IN 
THE A.L. WEST, 
SWEEPING THE 
DIAMONDBACKS 
OVER THE 
WEEKEND.
SAN DIEGO CHECKS
IN 3 GAMES OVER 
500, ALSO WITH A
SHARE OF A 
WESTERN DIVISION
LEAD, ALONG WITH
THE DODGERS OUT 
IN FRONT OF THE 
PACK IN THE N.L.
WEST.
MARK: MATTY, I 
HAD A CHANCE TO 
TALK WITH 
MANAGER BRUCE 
BOCHY OFF THE 
GAME AND I KNOW 
THE QUESTION YOU
AND I ASKED WAS 
THE LEAD-OFF 
SPOT, TALKING 
ABOUT THE 
LEAD-OFF 
POSITION AND THE
OPTIONS THAT 
BOCH HAD.
GOING WITH 
CAMERON TONIGHT,
PROBABLY WITH 
E.Y. TOMORROW 
AGAINST 
MILLWOOD, BUT 
THE OTHER 
OPTIONS ARE 
BARFIELD AND 
BELLHORN, 
DEPENDING ON WHO
IS GOING TO BE 
PITCHING THAT 
DAY FOR THE 
OPPOSITION.
SO MIKE CAMERON 
HAS EXPERIENCE 
IN THE PAST 
BATTING 
LEAD-OFF, AND 
ALREADY HE HAS 
SEEN FOUR OR 
FIVE PITCHES AS 
BARFIELD GETS 
THE NIGHT OFF.
MATT: OFF THE 
END OF THE BAT A
FLY BALL IN 
SHORT RIGHT 
FIELD, MARK 
DeROSA COMING ON
IN THE WIND TO 
MAKE THE CATCH.
THE RANGERS 
DEFENSIVELY RANK
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE AMERICAN 
LEAGUE, BROUGHT 
TO YOU BY KRAGEN
AUTO PARTS, BRAD
WILKERSON, GARY 
MATTHEWS AND 
MARK DeROSA IN 
THE OUTFIELD, 
HANK BLALOCK, 
IAN KINSLER AND 
MARK TEIXEIRA IN
THE INFIELD.
MARK: THE 
OFFENSIVE 
NUMBERS FOR 
MICHAEL YOUNG, 
CONSISTENTLY UP 
THERE IN THE 
RANGER TOPS IN 
CERTAIN 
CATEGORIES, HE 
IS A GOOD ONE, 
THAT YOUNG.
MATT: NOTHING-1 
TO BLUM WHO AS I
MENTIONED, IS 
STARTING AS HIGH
IN THE ORDER AS 
HE HAS ALL YEAR 
AND THOUGH HE'S 
QUICKLY BEHIND 
0-2 TO PADILLA, 
HE HAS GREAT 
CAREER NUMBERS 
IN THIS MATCH-UP
AND THAT 
EXPLAINS WHY HE 
IS PLAYING BUT 
BATTING IN THE 
2-SPOT TONIGHT, 
ALSO.
POPPED HIM UP.
MARK TEIXEIRA 
OFF FIRST BASE 
FOR A QUICK 
SECOND OUT.
MARK: MATTY, YOU
MENTIONED THE 
WIND.
THE WIND IS 
HOWLING STRAIGHT
IN.
THE WIND IS 
WHIPPING IN 
STRAIGHT FROM 
CENTER FIELD.
MATT: SO 2 QUICK
OUTS FOR GILES, 
ALSO WITH CAREER
NUMBERS AGAINST 
VICENTE PADILLA 
AND GILES CHECKS
IN TONIGHT 
HAVING RIPPED 
THROUGH HE HAD 
EDISON FIELD IN 
ANAHEIM.
HERE IS THE 0-1.
A 7-13 ROAD TRIP
FOR GILES, THIS 
TRIP.
PADILLA HAS 
PITCHED WELL 
AGAINST THE 
PADRES IN HIS 
CAREER.
THERE'S A BASE 
HIT FOR GILES.
STAY HOT.
2 OUT SINGLE FOR
SAN DIEGO.
MARK: THE ONE 
THING I THINK 
ABOUT WHEN I SEE
PADILLA ON THAT
