the second floor. The town of clinton has less than 10,000 people. The mayor
says this accident has affected everyone.  This is the worst nightmares for
myself and our community.  We have a loving community. These are all our
folks. And every life in this community is touched by this.  Some of the

a bunch of people who want to hurt the united states of america. And for people
to leak that program and for a newspaper to publish it does great harm to the
united states of america.
