morning. Will, it appears he won't be going on a tirade for quite some time. But
said he spoke to his bosses. And that everything is okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. That's
right. The whole story is ridiculous when you think about it. >> I think a
little media attention goes a long way. >> You could say that. Take our example,
right 90 >> I don't know what you're talking about. What 90 >> Two days ago, did
know who joe mickalek was 90 not many people did until a three-minute meltedown

against andrea yates. They won a conviction in her first trial, but it was later
because of erroneous testimony by a prosecution witness. Former u.s. Attorney
kendall coffey is here, to tell us what they may have to do differently this
time. Hi. >> Good morning. >> So basically here we go again. Tell me a bit 2010
2010 remind me, if you will, about the witness that the prosecution will have
talking again this time but the same person who is to blame for the conviction
being overturned last time. What happened there 2010 >> The prosecution's star
witness was a {@ mental health @} expert who, among other things, testified that there
been an episode of "law 2010 order" in which a woman suffering from the same
kind of {@ postpartum depression @} drowned her kids in the bathtub and had gotten off
reason of insanity. Supposedly according to the expert that episode aired
shortly after the time {@ andrea yates @} {@ murdered @} her children. That was wrong. No
such episode occurred. So the appeals court sent the case back for another
trial. >> As in the first trial, we understand yates is pleading not guilty by
reason of insanity. Is there a legal definition of what being insane is and how
does that compare to what her attorney said was her severe postpartum psychosis
2010 >> This is one of the most dramatic {@ controversies @} in {@ mental illness @} and
insanity because everybody acknowledges that andrea yates was meant mentally
ill. In texas the question is whether or not she knew that what she was doing
was wrong. >> Does {@ premeditation @} come into play here 2010 the prosecutor claims
that yates waited until her husband had gone to work to drown the kids and
before the mother-in-law came to care for them. >> Absolutely. Though
circumstances, the fact that she showed what she did was wrong or illegal called
police, seemed to aknowledge in different ways what the defense is doing in
this trial is coming up with a focus on why she believed that what she was doing
was doing right by the kids because, according to the {@ defense @} theory now, we're
going to hear she was trying to save these children from some kind of satanic
forces, save these children from eternal condemnation. >> It's hard to watch the
we have playing of just home video of the kids. I'm wondering, too, the children
the doomed children's pajamas yesterday. How hard is it for the jurors to clear
their minds and focus on the facts 2010 >> It's going to be very tough. Despite
the obvious {@ evidence of mental illness @} , andrea yates committed such a horrifying
one thing to remember about the defense of insanity in general, it's very rarely
it is one of the most overrated defenses. Actually less than 1 1 of criminal
cases is a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity. >> Thank so you
much for the insight. Always good to talk to you. >> Appreciate it >> Thanks,
robin. >>> Kansas' death penalty law is {@ constitutional @} and doesn't amount to

members of an elks lodge were just sitting down to dinner. About 50 people were
inside. At one point, 10 people were trapped inside. We understand that eight
have been rescued so far. They are still working at the scene, as you can see,
this morning, and the mayor there said this town is about 10 ,000 people large,
and there's not one soul that hasn't been affected by this. >>> Radio host rush

actions were wrong in 2001 , but yates' lawyer argues that she suffers from post

for those of us who know her and love her to forgive her than it has been for
her to frifr herself. I think now she's hoping that she's found not guilty by
reason of insanity so she can spend her time in a hospital rather than state
prison. >>> New information could put pressure on merck in court. >> In court,
merck has made the claim that vioxx raised the risk of stroke or heart attack
only after 18 months of use. But the new england journal of medicine disputes
the claim. The journal now says the increased health risk starts earlier for
vioxx patients, but it did not specify a time frame. Merck faces more than 11

years to come 67 with everything that is going on, you're telling me that the
new york times can release secret information on how we're trying to stop al
qaeda and nothing can be done there but we can tell people they can't burn the
flag. Where are our priorities 67 >> Sticking with the flag burning, an election
vote. Maybe it's to rally the base. >> I'm so tired of politicians on both sides
the aisles treating us like children. With john kerr ly y going out last week
and saying we need to bring the troops home right away. He knows we can't. He is
everything he can do appeal to the straight left. Here's an idea. Let's get down
some real business. You want to appeal to conserve actives 67 here's an idea.
balance the freaking budget. >> Critics think, too, this flag burning thing
might have a better chance of passing than say the same-sex marriage ban. So do
you think you're going to see more of this coming for november 67 >>
unfortunately, congress doesn't really have any intention of sealing the borders
building fences or just stopping illegal immigrants. They have no intention of
actually getting that done. That's just nothing but games to have voters appeal
67 67 to appeal to voters. What they do have intentions of doing is staging
opportunities with a flag behind them so they look very patriotic and american.
that will go to november november. It doesn't appeal to me. I am a conservative.
thing is 67 67 this goes back to the new york times 67 67 we have unbelievable
rights. But more important than the rights are the responsibilities. And too
many people in america forget the responsibilities. You have a responsibility
not to burn the flag because of the people who died fighting for the things that
flag represents. >> But you're allowed to do it. >> Absolutely. >> Glenn beck.
really got to the soapbox. I think you're back in the swing of things. >> Thank
you very much, robin. >>> If you want to hear more of glenn beck's unique

good morning to you. >> So they're not exactly 9 9 >> A baseball powerhouse in
comparison to some of these other schools. >> But they beat the big boys. >>
that's all you have to say is they beat the big boys. >>> The thinking around
college baseball is that a team from the pacific northwest can't compete with
powerhouses from warmer climates. It often rains in that part of the country.
and three oregon schools already shut down their baseball programs. So you can
see where the perception comes from. But oregon state showed it's doubters that
they can hang with anyone. Or the big boys, like robin likes to say. After
dropping the opener, the beavers fought off elimination six times in the college
series. Game three, winner-take-all, versus north carolina. Bottom of the 8 th,
2 2 all. U.n.c's bryan steed is in for defensive purposes. Steed makes the
routine play, but throws wildly to first. Bill rowes scores on the error. Osu
goes up, 3 -2 , and hangs on for its first college world series title. >>> We
can't say we didn't see this coming. The minor league manager that threw a major
on the field received his punishment. Asheville's joe mikulik will fork over a
grand, and serve a seven game suspension. Nothing was safe during his three
minute tirade. You can tell by these pictures >> I like to watch the players. >>

second base, they turned away like i don't want to see this. >> What would you
do -2 >> You don't want to stare at your manager. >> Anyway, he apologized to
the fans and umpires and admitted he went to far. Naaahh. >>> "mikulik" is
already becoming popular in the english language. We'll use it in a sentence in
these astros-tigers highlights. Lance berkman hits a grounder to second, placido
gets berkman at first. Berkman throws his helmet and gets tossed. Astros manager
garner goes "mikulik" and gets ejected as well. Bere garner leaves, he throws a
chair. >> That's nothing >> That is nothing. Tigers win, 10 -4 >> Four days ago

re-trial resumes in about two hours. In yesterday's opening statements, the
prosecutor said, yates knew her actions were wrong when she drowned her five
young children in a bathtub in 2001 but yates' lawyer argues, she suffered from
severe postpartum psychosis. Yates' ex-husband says he supports his wife's
defense. >> For a long time she's blamed herself. And it's been a lot easier for
of us who know her and love her than it has been for her to forgive herself. I
think she hopes now she's found not guilty to she can spend herself in a
hospital rather than prison. >> Yates' first conviction was overturned due to an
in witness testimony. >>> Staedz instead of pigging out hogs are on a diet. That
leaner pork for you. An analysis by the usda said the content of fat has been
decreased. There have been new feeding techniques for hogs. >>> Men who have
several older brothers are more likely to be gay, whether they were raised
together or not. That's according to a new study. It found the increase was seen
men with older brothers from the same mother. But not those who had older
step-brothers or adopted brothers. Canadian researchers say the study adds
weight to the idea that sexual orientation is based on biology. >>> Some leading

you could buy an ipod nano for every american citizen. What a job it could
create if you were just working for just the interest on 66 billion at a modest
3 3 0 you would pull in 0 5 million a day. For 66 billion, everybody who lost
money in the enron scandal could be repaid. The levies could be repaired. 66
billion would cover most of the cost of returning to the moon. Or you could
weave a rope of bills to climb there. And you could brag about it by buying up
every commercial in the super bowl. Super bowl for the next four and a half
centuries. That's the problem. 66 66 billion is just a breathtaking amount of
money. Ten times as much as the budgets for the united way and the red cross
combined. But what that money can do is also incomprehensible because it can and
will bring food, shelter, medicine and hope to millions around the globe. Tom
foreman, cnn, washington. >> Let's hope that it does. >>> Warren buffett's
children will likely be the first to start handing out the nearly 66 37 billion

last night sending the top two floors crashing down. A local elks' lodge was
hosting a dinner at the time. >> We're on the second floor in the dining room.
we're all eating. And i'm sitting with my back basically to the 31 31 well, the
west wall. And all of the sudden there was a loud noise. And i turned to see
what it was. And the floor had disappeared. And so as i turned back around,
before i had a chance to move, the floor underneath me caved in. And myself and
nine other members of the elks lodge dropped with the floor down halfway between
first floor and the second floor with the third floor and the roof caving in on
top of us. It all happened so fast, but yet it seemed like everything was moving
slow motion >> I can't imagine that. As you look at what's left of the building,
associated press says the person killed was the elks club leader. >>> Tempers
are flaring on capitol hill over a reported plan to reduce the number of u.s.
troops in iraq. Just last week democratic proposals for troop withdrawal were
called defeatist. Suzanne malveaux reports on the war of words over the war in
iraq. Good morning. >> Reporter: Good morning, robin. Well, as you know, iraq
really is the number one issue for american voters. Republicans, democrats, the
white house are all very much aware of that. As we get closer to the congressal
midterm elections that are ratcheting up this debate, if you will. And the
center of the debate is when are u.s. Troops going to come home. Democrats
charge that a plan under consideration by the u.s. Xland commander in iraq to
pull out 10 ,000 u.s. Troops as early as the fall is politically motivated >> We
need a september or october surprise with the present republicans claiming
victory and announcing troop redeployment just in time for the midterm
elections. >> Reporter: They refuted the charge. >> Terms of the troop presence
there that decision will be made by general casey based upon conditions on the
ground. >> Reporter: But democrats are fuming over not one but two bills shot
down by republicans last week which called for a timetable for u.s. Troop
withdrawal. Republicans painted the democrats proposal as a move to cut and run.
a look at the substance of both plans showed the bill by reed and levin is
similar to casey's plan. But the white house says the democratic plan was not
sound. >> What he did not mention was conditions on the ground. What senator
levin want to do was get out. >> Reporter: What kerry wants to do is pulling out
troops by the summer of 2007 they want to phase out tens of thousands of troops
by the end of next year. But it does not have a hard deadline for complete
withdrawal. >> The kind of withdrawals that we're talking about are really
minimal minimal. And the president probably can argue reasonably that
circumstances on the ground are driving the decisions. >> Reporter: They say
what may be just as important as troop withdrawal, perhaps even more important,
is really what happens on the ground in iraq. Do we see more bombings orchid
nappings or beheadings. >> Suzanne; there any concern that maybe congressional
republicans could appear to be at odds with the president about troop withdrawal
>> Reporter: There's one thing the republicans are concerned about. That is
really the political calculation. If you put a deadline, put numbers, attach it
to any legislation or put it out there that the white house agrees it really is
a political trap out there. You put it out and people can say, well, you said
you were going to withdraw 10 ,000. It's only 5 ,000. Therefore, you've backed
away. So that is the one thing they are concerned about and trying to avoid. >>
thank you so much. Appreciate it. >>> Army staff sergeant christian bagge will
get a wish come true at the white house today. He lost both legs in iraq and he
asked president bush to jog with him when they met on new year's day. The

swim. I want to mountain bike. The biggest goal of all is to do what i did
before. >> Bagge says he hopes to be an inspiration to others. >>> Water-logged

closed several federal buildings including the irs the commerce department and
justice department. I don't know, guys. Did we already let suzanne go. It looked
in the d.c. Area. Let's find out if they're going to see a break today or not >>
no. We had a live shot a couple hours ago with sunshine. >> The reporter said, i
believe the sun is shining. >> It is good news now but bad news later. >>
explain by sad would be bad. >> The sunshine heats up the ground. As it warms
up, the air around it begins to rise. That is really unstable air. It aids in
instability. You have sunshine now. You start seeing more clouds. The end
result, bigger thunderstorms. That's what's going to happen later today around

yesterday, heavy rains downed trees and created several travel headaches.
flooding has also closed several federal buildings, including the irs, the
commerce department and justice department. >> I heard a rumbling. The walls
swelled out a little bit. Then all of a sudden the top of the building just

president bush and others in washington are not happy about reports on a secret
treasury program to track the financial records of terror suspects. Three major
newspapers carried the story. President bush says they're making it harder to
win the war on terror >> The disclosure of this program is disgraceful. We're at
with a bunch of people that want to hurt the united states of program. For a
newspaper to publish it, does great harm to the united states of america. >>
there's a lot of times that newspapers do and sometimes you guys in television
do that i don't like. But i 9 9 and i understand senator specter said something
to the affect this morning. I believe jefferson was right. If you give me a free

ministers was there to give a speech to the prisoners before they were released.
told them they were being released as part of the national reconciliation plan.
there was rounds of applause for the minister before the prisoners came out and
shook his hands on his way to release the prisoners. I talked to, some of them
have been there for a year and a half and others for eight months. Said he had
been arrested on the corner for holding a cell phone. All of them thought this
was a good idea to help with national reconciliation but they did say unless all
were released they didn't think the government 450 450 they didn't think the
plans would go far enough unless all the prisoners had been released. The
government says it is getting indications, positive indications, from its
intermediaries who are dealing with different elements within the insurgency.
certainly the government is not reporting at this stage that any of the
insurgent groups have heard the amnesty and are laying down their weapons. It
seems to be at this stage a very slow, or low indication, if you will, from the
government. What the minister did say is it is a necessary step, they have to
take this step, even if some of the people they're releasing go out and then
commit acts of violence. He said they have to take this risk at this time. They
said this is a mold, the reconciliation is a model followed all over the world
for ending conflicts. >> Well, again, that was nic robertson reporting from

morning to you, robin. We have a situation developing right now. First, again, a
little blob of moisture off the coast of south carolina. About 140 miles due
south of cape fear, north carolina. Might have a circulation at the sur fashion.
it does it could rapidly intensify into a tropical depression, might even become
tropical storm late today. There could be tropical storm warnings posted for the
coastline, mainly the outer banks down to the south. If it happen, it's going to
quick. They're sending an airplane into it later this morning, an air force
reconnaissance craft. That's this morning into the early afternoon hours. Should
some data after that. Either way, it's going to enhance the rainfall totals as
it moves to the coastline later today. Plenty of rain for the carolinas through
new york city. That's going to be enhanced if this thing does, in fact, develop.
for the great lakes, cooler pocket of air, daytime heating, will produce a
little bit of hail. Hailmakers from milwaukee, madison, to chicago, maybe as far
as places like cleveland and erie. Steady rain from the south. That's the case
for most of the day. Stormy conditions along the eastern seaboard. We're drying
out through dallas. More thunderstorms, a risk today, into places like utah,
northern arizona. High fire danger for you this afternoon and heat across places
the p.a.c. Northwest. More of those temperatures coming up in just a little bit.
all right, while bob was doing the weather, we were working on a breaking story
that's coming to us out of the middle east. It could be maybe a watershed moment
experts wonder, for middle east peace. Apparently hamas has recognized the
rights of israel to exist. Here's the deal. Hamas has never done that before and
to say that israel has a right to exist. But hamas and fatah have apparently
signed an agreement that calls for the establishment of two side by side states,
palestinian state and an israeli state. So there you have the right for both
states to exist. It's always refused to do so. And it doesn't mean that hamas is
to say that there will no longer be terrorist attacks against israelis and there
potential other palestinian factions who will not go along with this agreement.
but main point about this is that hamas, which has never done so before, has
apparently now recognized israel's right to exist by signing this agreement. A
potentially very big agreement. We'll have reaction right after this. The thing

unthinkable. For their parents, too. J.k. Rowling's books about the boy wizard
have banished from the shelves and not just here in britain. The last book sold
4 million copies on the day it came out in the united states. And then there are
films with daniel radcliffe in the starring role, the last one made 15 million
pounds in three days when it opened in british cinemas. J.k. Rowling, posing
with the stars, has had every reason to smile. But all good things must come to
an end. Is harry himself about to be killed off, now the seventh and final book
is being written 15 >> I've never been tempted to kill him off before the end of
seven because i always planned seven books and that's where i want to go. I want
finish all seven books. >> Yeah. >> I can completely understand, however, the
mentality of an author who thinks, i'm going to kill them off because that means
can be no nonauthor-written sequels, as they call them. >> Reporter: It did

palestinian militant group hamas has signed a document that implicitly

alongside israel, which implies that israel has a right to be there. Now, the
document also calls for fewer terrorist attacks on israelis. Moderate

it's going to be a huge rainmaker. Let me show you the forecast. 81 in
washington. Same in new york city. Boston a little more sunshine. 81 in
albuquerque. 108 in las vegas. Yesterday we had a lot of rainfall. Had some good

to last 7.5 how bad is it going to get 7.5 >> It started on thursday with a
station yaer frontal boundary. We were talking about huge rain amounts coming

surgeon general is releasing a new report, the first on this issue in about 20
years. Christy feig already has the details for us. I know some alarming
information in this report. >> It's some surprising stuff and reviewing a lot of
we already know. We are talking about secondhand smoke. This is the smoke that
comes off cigarettes. It's exhaled from smokers. The american cancer society
says there are 60 known and suspected carcinogens in secondhand smoke. It was
linked to health problems in 1986 in the original report. Over the years more
and more health problems have been found. >> We know secondhand smoke can cause
asthma, it can cause emphysema, and it can also cause cancers, and then also the
of cardiovascular disease that's still being studied with secondhand smoke.
there's some very significant scientific changes in the last 20 years. >> Now,
according to the american lung association, every year in the u.s. 3 ,000 lung
cancer deaths, 35 ,000 heart disease deaths, and a number of respiratory
problems are caused by secondhand smoke. Doctors say those numbers right there
are the reason this is a public health problem. >> So what's the take-home
message in this report. What does he say needs to be done 35 >> One of the main
things they were looking at in in report is is there a level of secondhand smoke
is safe 35 can you be exposed to some and not have problems 35 in this report
they are announcing for the first time that there is not a safe level of
secondhand smoke, even being exposed to d to just a little bit can put you at
risk for increased health problems. >> People thought if i had a filter or air
conditioner, it won't bother me. There is no safe level of secondhand smoke.
even for a few minutes it's harmful. It begins a cascade of events that can
cause significant harm to a person, so clearly there is no safe level of
secondhand smoke. >> And that, of course, will back this trend we're seeing in
about a dozen states now to include smoke-free workplaces including restaurants
and bars. This report very likely to add to their argument. >> Yeah, being a
very controversial topic at this point too. Are there any groups in particular
that are higher at risk than others 35 >> Well, babies and young children are at
high risk for this. A pregnant mother who is smoking is putting her baby at risk
low birthweight, lung problems, and an increased risk of sids. >> Christy feig,

pacific northwest can't really compete against warmer climate schools. After
all, it rains there a lot in that part of the region. Oregon state university
clouded up and rained all over the competition at the college word series. What
make this story is great is they faced elimination six times and bounced back
every time. Winner take all game between oregon state and north carolina. Bottom

medicine" now disputes the 18 18 month claim. It corrected the results of a
merck-sponsored study it previously published. The journal now says the

off before the end of book seven because i always planned seven books and that's
i want to go, i want to finish all seven books. I can completely understand,

surgeon general say needs to be done 35 >> One of the main things they were
looking at in the report is is there a level of second-hand smoke that is safe,
can you be exposed to some and not have problems 35 they are announcing for the
first time there is not a safe level of second-hand smoeng smoke. Even being
exposed to a little second-hand smoem smoke can put you at an increased risk of
health problems. In the past, people thought well if i have a filter, an air
conditioner, it won't both me. There is no safe level of second-hand smoke.
second-hand smoke even more a few minutes is harmful and begins a cascade of
event that is can cause significant harm to person. Clearly, there is no safe
level of second-hand smoke. >> That, of course, will back the trend we see in a
dozen states now to include smoke free workplaces including restaurants and
bars. This report very likely to add to their argument. >> Yeah, being a very
controversial topic at this point too. Are there any groups in particular that
are higher at risk than others 35 >> Well, babies and young children are at very
risk. A pregnant mother who is smoking is putting her baby at risk for low birth

the situation 26.5 >> Mike, i'm hearing that all guests have been accounted for.
an arson investigation team on the scene from the state of gachlt beside being
26 years in law enforcement, i had over 20 years as a volunteer fire chief in
virginia, just outside dc, was part of a collapse team. From the looks of this,
mike, they are going to be looking for the cause and origin of this. And first
thing to come to mind when you see damage like this would be possiblyly a gas
explosion, natural gas explosion or a propane gas explosion. There's also the
possibility have you to look into nowadays especially rural areas like this the
polt of a meth lab inside. Explosion from a meth lab would do this kind of
damage, but it is hard to do if it would do this extensive damage. Have you one
whole side of the back side of the two-story hotel that has been collapsed. We
saw earlier firefighters with lines trained on that, there was some fire inside
of the hotel. But they are now having to wait for special equipment to come in
before they can go in and start to search for anybody who may be trapped inside.
mike, let's pick up on that, you mentioned gas, propane, math lab, a lot of
possibilities here. How do you proceed as a rescue worker 20 what is object
number one, obviously people, i know 20 >> Right, people. One of the things that
rescue worker, when you start to go into the void spaces and areas where you
look for victims, have you to take readings to make sure that the atmosphere you
going into is not dangerous. All firefighters, fire departments have these
readers. They can go in and test the atmosphere before they go in. But one of
the big things have you to worry about, we are looking at pictures now of the
extensionive collapse of this is to make sure that they don't get hurt
themselves when they go in. Have you to go in, look for the victims, you may
have to shore up heavy equipment to look for anybody that may be trapped. >>
this damage is very extensionive. What is your conjecture on this 20 >> I'll
tell you, mike, first thing i thought of was a gas explosion. This is the kind
of damage, i have been on gas explosions myself of private homes and businesses,
is had a this looks like. Again, that would be pure speculation at this time
until the investigation moves forward. But again still early phase of the
investigation, waiting for specialized equipment and heavy equipment to get in
there before they can go in and look for people who may be trapped inside. >>
mike brooks we appreciate your insight on the story. Take care. >> Thank you,
mike. >>> President bush is calling on the senate to pass the line-item veto.

the measure is close to being approved. The amendment reportedly needs one more

leader in iraq. Suzanne malveaux reports on the war over the word withdraw,
causing a lot of upheaval. >> Reporter: You're right. Polls show the number one
concern for american voters is iraq. Republicans know it, deps know it, the
white house knows it. All of these groups, vrs, aggressively trying to shape
this debate and what is at the center of this debate is when are u.s. Troops
going to come home 50 democrats charge that a plan under consideration by the
u.s. Commander in iraq, general george casey, to possibly pull out as many as 10
u.s. Troops aser as the fall is politically motivated. >> September or october
surprise with the present republicans proclaiming victory announcing troop
redeployments just in time for the mid-term elections. >> Reporter: The
president categorically refuted the charge. >> In terms of our troop pretens
there, that decision will be made by general casey as well as the sovereign
government of iraq based upon condition on the ground. >> Reporter: But
democrats are fuming over not one but two bills shot down by republicans last
week, which called for a timetable for u.s. Troop withdrawal. Republicans
paintsed the democrats proposal as a prove to cut and run. But a look at the
substance of both democratic plans show the bill offered by senators jack reid
and carl levin, calling for phased redeployment of troops by the end of 2006 is
similar to general casey's reported plan, aimed at pulling out two combat
brigades by the end of the year. The white house sizz the democratic plan was
not sound. >> What senator levin did not mention, conditions on the ground.
senator levin wanted to get out. >> Reporter: The other proposal by senators

calling for pulling out all troops by the summer of 2007 the pentagon wants to
phase out tens of thousands of troops by the end of next year, but does not have
hard deadline for complete withdrawal. >> The kind of withdrawals that we're
talking about are really minimal, and the president probably can argue
reasonably that circumstances on the ground are driving the decisions. >>
reporter: Political analysts say what may be just as important if not more
important than withdrawing troops, is, really, what happens on it's ground in
iraq. Are we going to see more bombings, kidnappings or beheadings 2007 if you
actually pull out some 10 ,000 troop bice the end end of this year it may not
have as much of an impact in changes the administration's standing when it comes

changed to ban flag burning. The proposed amendment would roll back a 1989
supreme court decision that struck down state laws banning flag desecration.
here's a live look on the hill as they begin that debate. Supporters argue the
flag is a unique symbol that demands protection. Those against the measure say
it's a matter of protecting free speech, even if it's unpopular. Illinois
senator richard durbin says republicans are using the debate to rally support
for upcoming elections. The house approved the new measure last year. All 50
states have passed non-binding resolutions endorsing an amendment. >>> The fbi's

stuff and reviewing a lot ever suns we already know. Both hands there. We're
talking about secondhand smoke. The smoke that comes off cigarette, es hailed
from smokers. The american cancer society says there are 60 known and suspected
carcinogens in secondhand smoke. First linked to health problems in 1986 in the
original surgeon general's report. Over the years more and more health problems
have been found. >> We know secondhand smoke can exacerbate or cause as pla. It
can cause inif a sima, and it can also cause cancers, and then also the risk of
cardiovascular disease, still studied with secondhand smoke. Very significant
scientific changes in the last 20 years. >> Reporter: Now, according to the
american lung association, every year in the u.s., 3 ,000 lung cancer deaths, 35
heart disease deaths, and the number of respiratory problems are caused by
secondhand smoke. Doctors say those numbers right there are the reason that this
a public health problem. >> Absolutely. What's the take-home message in this
report 35 what does he say, the surgeon general, needs to be done 35 >>
reporter: One of the main things looked at, is there a level of secondhand smoke
is safe 35 can you be exposed to some and not have problems 35 in this report,
they are announcing for the first time, there is not a safe level of secondhand
smoke, even exposed just a little bit of secondhand smoke can put you at an
increased risk of health problems. >> In the past, people thought, well if i
have a filter if i have an air conditioner, won't bother me. There is no safe
level of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke even for a few minutes is harmful,
and begins a cascade of events that can cause significant harm to a person. So
clearly, there is no safe level of sex secondhand smoke. >> Reporter: That, of
course will back this trend, seeing in about a dozen states, to include
smoke-free workplaces including restaurants and bars. This report very likely to
to their argument. >> And, yeah, being a very controversial topic at this point,
any groups in particular that are higher at risk than others 35 >> Reporter:

government isn't doing enough to protect the non-smokers. She writes it isn't
fair for non-smockers to inhale toxic chemicals in public places where all the
government la to do is ban smoking in those places. >> Asking, why is everybody
dumping on smoke jers there are lots of things that can cause health problems

the internet for illegal purposes, prosecute, bring them to justice. Secondly,
trying to follow the money, and stop the payment, shut down these illegal sites,
excitingly, now a number of these companies have come forward and said we want
to develop special technology to help do this, just as we're attacking spam,

talk and making it illegal for adults to contact kids, but we all know that the

to make, again, things safer as we go forward 50 >> Mike, we hosted a meeting a
few days ago with myspace and the other leading networking sites to try to
develop a strategy. Clearly, we have to make kids safer on these sites. Tens of
millions of americans are using social networking site and younger and younger
kids are trying to do it as well. So we're taking steps, we're using technology,
using reporting approaches, we're looking at age verification, and a host of
tools to try and make sure people can use those tools safely and responsibly. >>

amnesty in the interest of what he calls "national reconciliation." where will
this lead 67 tony karon, senior editor at time.com, joins us from new york with
a closer look at what the prime minister is and is not offering. Tony, welcome.
tell us your out thats on this plan so far, the release of what, 2500 detainees.
will this mean 2500 >> Well, i think what you're seeing with this plan is the
dilemma that prime minister maliki is caught in. Because what he has to do is
appeal to the sunnis and bring them in, which means basically accommodating the
insurgency, disarming the insurgency by giving it a political part but at the
same time keeping the shiites on board and keeping the united states on board.
so you see this very clearly in the amnesty question. Does he give amnesty to
the insurgency side or kill u.s. Troops 2500 the original version of the plan
said yes, it makes a distinction between terrorism which is seen against iraqis
and resistance which is seen as against u.s. Forces. That paragraph was dropped,
this u.s. Backers can't allow a government for killing americans, but
nonetheless that seems to be the instinct of where they immediate to go with
this to bring the insurgency in >> You write that unless they are given amnesty
they have no incentive to embrace this deal. What do you mean by that 2500 >>
obviously if the object of offering an amnesty is to sper per suede the
insurgents to put down their weapons and join the political process it's it
doesn't make to sense to say those who attack americans won't get amnesty
because that's who the insurgency is. They are lodging attacks against the
americans and the sunni political parties in parliament are the ones who are
very basically strongly pushing they need to be recognized as a legit legitimate
of the iraqi political process for the united states that's unacceptable, but
maliki can't say he's doing that, but if he's doing that it's a stillborn
amnesty. >> Who is he dealing with 2500 is there some consortium that negotiates
good faith 2500 >> There's different elements, the al qaeda minority which is no
than 10 percent. The u.s. And iraqi government has been negotiating reportedly
with a grouping of seven smaller insurgent groups. That's been going on for some
and this reflects that. Larger insurgent groups haven't engaged in those kind of
who say they want, you know, to negotiate directly with the united states and
the pull-out really is their primary demand. But the idea is to put forward
something to gives insurgents a road back into politics as a way of disarming
them. >> Over the weekend i heard a report, i think it was the times in london
that a planned reconciliation may also include a troop withdrawal was that just
a test market, run it up the flag pole, see who likes it and who didn't 10 >>
no, but what happened was the original version had to be approved by all the
political factions and the shiites walked back a lot of these points. The
amnesty was trimmed back by the shiites an also the question of demanding a u.s.
withdrawal and very publicly inviting the insurgents into the process because
the shiites are also very skeptical of who the insurgents are they don't want
them in the political process but for the shiites they represent the old regime.
sounds like the reconciliation is very much a work in progress. Thanks very
much, tony. Appreciate your help. >>> And for more information, check the web.
