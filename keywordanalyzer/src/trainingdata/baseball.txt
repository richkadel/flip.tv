 to work with and get going. And merv said in the regame show, not only knowing
 the guys' swings, he can get that down in one day. It's good to know what's
 going on between the ears. Merv said on the plane after {@ watching greenie @} , he
 said "he's a good one." he has such high potential. We aunl that. Matt: it's
 been a solid month since greene's last home run, may 20 th {@ against seattle @} . And
 talk to some and it's a mechanics issue with {@ khalil @} being a {@ feel hitter @} and the
 that he's constantly feeling different and {@ changing his stance @} and approach,
 seemingly at-bat to at-bat, there are those that feel like it's going to be
 difficult to get into rhythm when you're dealing with yourself like that, but
 then you can look at a guy like cal {@ ripken @} and say, that's not true, because he
 that all the time, and look at what he did. Mark: it's almost like a pitcher
 changing his delivery each and every pitch. Guys trying to be consistent.
 sometimes they will alter the release point and the arm angle on certain
 pitches, but mechanically speaking, your body is pretty much the same. Matt:
 blew a {@ fastball @} past him. Nothing i matt: to the bottom of the inning ask we
 answer the aflac question. Who is the first manager of the rangers 20 {@ ted
 williams @} , managed the team for 3 years in washington and then moved with the
 team to arlington for their in their innagural season, here. {@ Ted williams @} , is
 do as i do, not as a say, and ted was always frustrated with the fact that
 players couldn't do physically what he was able to do in their spots and never
 had any success managing what was in his defense a bad {@ rangers @} team. Mark: a
 bad, bad team, and then you go on 3 3 there's tom griev who used to be the
 manager for the texas rangers and he played for {@ ted williams @} , here in {@ Texas @} ,
 father of {@ ben griev @}. Matt: {@ hank blalock @} with 1 gone, he singled in that first
 {@ inning @} score for the rangers. You know, the rangers when they first moved here,
 did not have a lot of continuity in that managerial seat, in fact, before bobby
 spent almost eight years here as a manager, the longest stint that any ranger
 manager had was 3 years. Mark: let me guess some guys in between. {@ Whitey
 Herzog @} , {@ Billy Martin @} , {@ Buddy Bell @} 3 3 no, he played here. Matt: Right. Done
 Zimmer played here, {@ Frank Lacasey @} managed here for 3 3 plus years. There's a
 line drive for a hit. Bla intla a pure hitter as he singles into left, 2 for 2
 tonight. Mark: Sharply lit to left, and he can turn on one and put it out of
 the ballpark and hurt you that way, toochlt second time this evening he has
 gone the opposite way. Matt: so a 1 1 out batter in front of {@ Mark Derosa @} now.
 he grounded into a fielder's choice play that ended the first. First batter
 against {@ Mike Thompson @} since the first inning. It ends a stretch of 8 in a row
 retired. So far so good for mike in his first go-round against an {@ American
 League @} opponent. It's onthing when you're 8 8 you know, you're getting that
 first-ever start against the {@ American league @} against the royals at home, you
 know, but he happens to be dealing to one of the most potent teams in baseball
 on hir home turf in his first go-round. Mark: it's a high, fastball hitting
 team. They like the fastball. You can judge that. So what do you do 8 you take
 the sting out of the bat. He's throwing change-ups, pitching backwards, on a
 fastball count he will flip up a {@ breaking ball @} , take a little off his fastball
 and try to make them fish for pitches like that when he's ahead. I can
 guarantee you one thing {@ Mike Thompson @} in a 2 -2 count with a runner on he's not
 to throw a fastball for a strike down the middle of the plate. Matt: san
 diego's turned 1 double play tonight, mark derosa lines up the middle and went
 out and got that ball. Back-to-back 1 1 out sin gels, and texas is in business
 here in the 4 th. Mark: we mentioned in the pregame show how you have to keep
 the ball down and {@ mark Derosa @} goes down and gets that one. And you know what,
 if he reaches for it like that, hits it in the sweet spot, a 1 1 hopper to
 center field you'll take it. You would rather have him do that than have a 2 2
 run shot. Matt: so now {@ Kevin Mench @} , the d.h., he has been swinging a hot bat
 with 9 knocks in his last 8 games. Speaking of streaks, it wasn't too long ago
 back in april that {@ Kevin Mench @} put together a very {@ impressive streak @} , tomorrow
 son working to him out of the stretch and miss to go make it 2 0 home runs in 7
 games and in fact, missed tying a major league record for home runs in
 consecutive affairs. A bouncing ball to third. {@ Castilla @} to blum, that's all
 they get as they cut down the middleman, no relay throw, runners at the corner
 is with 2 gone. 
 Mark: looked like blum at second base couldn't find the handle.
 got the ball nice and made a feed to geoff. He cannot find it. Matt: now the
 south swinging {@ Brad Wilkerson @} , he grounded to short in his first at-bat
 tonight. Bouncing ball to second. So back-to-back 1 1 out singles, but the
 rangers are turned away in the 4 th. Tied.at insurance 4 what insurance is that
 4 AFLAC. 4 duck grunts 4 the one ya' really need to have... If you don't have
 it. That's why you need it. Need what 4 aflac. Well, if you get hurt and miss
 work it won't hurt to miss work. Huh 4 and they give ya' cash which is just as
 good as money. Aflac. Ask about it at work. 4 duck grunts 4 matt: after a
 strong start offensively, this has settled into a {@ pitchers @} do you live dual, 1
 -1 tie, as castilla leads things off, {@ Castilla @} , {@ Johnson @} and {@ Cameron @} here
 against {@ Vicente Padilla @} , a run on hits for both the rangers and the padres here
 vinny sends one into right center field, {@ mark derosa @} and {@ gary matthews @} are
 back, look at vinny, a doubles machine. A pair of 2 2 baggers for vinny to
 start the night. Mark: do you want me to say it or not 2 matt: say it. Mark:
 it's an in and out night forecast castilla, double you know he put some cheese
 on that one. Vinny too hot for tv, undescribable. He's doing damage within his
 10 th double. Vinny said he's been doing damage since he's been six years old,
 swinging the bat. Matt: here is ben johnson, an opportunity to do some damage
 here, a runner in scoring position. Mark: got to knock it to the right side,
 mark teixeira is playing well off the bag at first base. Matt: how about vinny,
 mudcat 10 we're talking about a veteran guy who a lot of people had written off
 done. Ben johnson into the corner, that's trouble. Foul in right. Mark: oh, man
 matt: wow 10 it looked like this ball dropped into fair territory, but first
 base {@ umpire bill wilkie @} was on it. Mark: from our vant vantage up here in the
 booth, that right field disappears on us. He gets that ball quicker out in
 front, that's trouble. He just missed it. Matt: and he shoots that one foul.
 mark: what's with these nets 10 there's one down the left field line and one
 down the right field line. Matt: perfectly legal. Mark: really 10 matt: yeah. I
 it's up to the individual club as far as if they have a net policy but there is
 on the major league baseball line that says you can't bring a fishing net to
 the ball game. Mark: i see that guy has one. Is that spielberg 10 matt: that
 guy looked like the actor, daniel 10 10 anyway, johnson shoots it into the
 corner, again foul. He's really playing with right field here. You got to like
 the approach, looking to send stuff into the opposite corner and johnson has
 been wide on t. Mark: if a pitcher is out on the mound and he keeps seeing
 that, let's see if he tries to buzz one inside on him, here. Matt: what's the
 name of this guy, mudcat 10 daniel stern. Mark: guy from "city slickers 10 "
 matt: yeah. Mark: no point on that one, my friend. Matt: partially obscured by
 the visor. 2 -2 now. Mark: i'm coming right back inside here, now, matty. Matt:
 mike cameron next. Castilla representing the go-ahead run on second base. Mark:
 like he's going away, though. Matt: 1 away and struck him out. Mark: well, it's
 right pitch, obviously, from vicente padilla, and the reason why i think he
 went back out there is because he would rather miss down and away to ben
 johnson rather than trying to come over the plate and getting hurt. Earl in the
 ben had the right approach and padilla wins the battle on that one. Matt: mike
 cameron trying to pick up the batter, fastball stays high to mike. Cameron 0 -2
 so far tonight. See if i can pick up vinny to make it a 2 -1 san diego game. We
 how the all-time season series between -1 -1 the all-time series that is
 between texas and san diego is even at 8 apiece. The padres are 6 -2 in san
 diego, 2 -6 here at the ballpark in arlington. There are so many names and
 faces that are different on this roster. Comparing it to the last one that
 played the rangers in interleague play. About the only real consistency, here,
 starts at the top with bruce bochy. 3 balls and no strikes the count to
 cameron. Let's see how careful vicente padilla is with a base open and one
 gone. 3 -1 mark: even looked like padilla on that 3 0 pitch eased up a little
 bit. It wasn'ts the 100 100 effort on that fastball. Hitting the corner to make
 3 -1 he might throw him a breaking ball here. Matt: instead it's ball 4 he
 threw him a fastball there on 3 -1 wow. Don't even bother wiping it, dude. -1
 chuckles -1 matt: i think he still has part of a hot dog from a cowboys game
 left over from the fall in that thing. -1 chuckles -1 here is blum with runners
 first and second. Mark: we need an extra-base hit here, matty. Matt: blum 0 -2
 so far tonight. Mark: good time to break out the {@ rally stick @} . That took care of
 monkey stick in {@ anaheim @} , huh -2 matt: i used to hate the rally monkey. I like
 him now. The things they've done with him on the scoreboard -2 1 -1 to blum.
 these are situations where {@ vicente padilla @} has gotten tough. With runners in
 scoring position hitters are hitting 0.31 0.217 , and with no one aboard, he's
 letting the hitters hit 0.302 0 2 gone in the swirling wind, and hank is able
 to make that catch. It is blowing tonight. Mark: some friar faithful here in
 arlington. Sporting the camel jersey. Matt: so now it will be up to giles with
 2 gone. Mark: did you see what vicente padilla did that at-bat, matty 2 off
 speed, popping him up in the infield. And with one out and that pop-up, the
 {@ infield fly rule @} was in effect. Batter out, runners advance at your own risk.
 matt: piazza next with 2 gone. Here's giles who singled, in his first try tone.
 ball hits him. The way brian reacted it was almost as though it missed him and
 it wasn't until the umpire said "take your base," that we were sure brian was
 hit by that ball. Mark: that's the first pitch he threw to geoff blum at the
 at-bat, aushlgs and it gets him right in the uncle hulka, right on the big toe.
 this is where {@ san diego @} needs to come up with a big blow, you don't need us to
 tell you that. Big bases loaded career numbers. Seen plenty of vicente padilla,
 full, 2 gone, this is san diego's best opportunity to hang a crooked number all
 mark: and the key is for piazza not to pull, see him trying there, matty,
 staying inside of it nicely 2 matt: padilla's thrown 88 pitches tonight, and i
 would almost say quietly. That pitch count has ris ento the point where buck
 showalter is watching the number. Mark: 3 3 's, 5 's, and 8 's. Matt: here is
 the nothing-1 to piazza, swung on and shot into right field, the base hit will
 score a run, they'll wave mike cameron around. {@ Piazza @} comes through with the
 bases loaded. On que, partner, mud talked about mike looking to right field and
 the second pitch of the at-bat, that's where the love comes, out to right field
 he drives in a pair to make it 3 -1 friars. Mark: oh lotta love. To right
 center. Oh yeah, believe that. Matt: it will bring the pitching coach, mark
 connor out to the mound for the first time tonight. Mike piazza gives the
 padres a 2 2 run lead here in the 5 th. Mark: that ball goes on the outside and
 stays on it nicely. With 2 outs, trevor hoffman is waving around cameron,
 running on the hit, running on contact. Matt: that is a vintage piazza swing,
 too. It almost looks like mike's weight is shifting toward his back leg from
 the moment the {@ pitch @} leaves the head. It looks like he's on his heels. And he's
 leaning back. Adrian gonzalez up now, 0 -1 to him. An opportunity for more now
 with san diego's hotest power bat on the trip. Giles at second, piazza the
 runner at first, 2 runs in with 2 gone. He was leading off the second and
 adrian gonzalez delivered our coors lite hit. A {@ driving home run @} , no. 10 of the
 and that tied us one apiece. Mark: looks like 10 10 bring a glove to the
 ballpark next time, buddy. Matt: adrian behind here, 0 -2 mark: tonight another
 about pad yashgs matty, i haven't seen him get hurt on breaking balls. All of
 his pitches, tonight, i think on hits that have really mattered have been on
 the fastball. He's missing with location on the fastball. Matt: remember the
 criticism on {@ padilla @} for a couple of years in philly was focus. Mark: yes.
 matt: gonzalez shoots that one foul. He had, at times, a rather acrimonious
 relationship with the front office personnel, and even coaching staff in
 philadelphia. There was more than 1 baseball pundant that looked at that trade
 and said {@ vicente padilla @} more than serviceable major league starter and he was
 exchanged for not a whole lot in compensation, almost to indicate the phillies
 wanted to unload him. He gets adrian here with a pitch that catches the outside
 the damage done, though, the piazza 2 2 run single makes it 3 -1 san diego.
 matt: padre fans, here in texas these days, a lot of fans have made the trip to
 we're not sure if they traveled in from san diego or if they're displaced san
 diego people, we welcome them. A drive into center field that gets over mike
 cameron, we haven't said that often this year. And a first-pitch double greets
 twom tomorrow in the last of the 5 th. Mark: matty, talked to a lot of
 {@ outfielder @} , and it's tough to judge that ball off the bat when it's hit
 directly at you over your head. He squares up on this ball nicely and look at
 mike, right over his head, directly over his head. Kid has some pop, now.
 mentioned in the minor leagues in '05 he hit 25 home runs. Matt: rod barajas
 with a chance to drive in a run now, {@ ian kinsler @} at second to lead things off,
 as barajas takes a strike. He has heated up. By the way, it's not nearly as hot
 here at game time as we were fearing. We were looking for temperatures still in
 90 s, and giles over plays the ball, and it wouldn't matter, {@ ian kinsler @} was
 going to score anyway, back-to-back open the 5 th examine bring the rangers to
 within a run. Mark: ideally you would like to keep rod barajas on first base.
 he doesn't run all that well. Brian overruns that and with that misque, and rod
 will take the extra 90 feet. Matt: back to the top of the order now, gary
 matthews, junior who has walked and flied to left. Getting into the scary part
 of this ranger lineup now, and there's no place to hide in it, but every time
 you look at {@ gary matthews @} , young, mark teixeira, and hank blalock, you got to
 work pretty hard, here. Mark: uh-huh. You see gary matthews did the first pitch
 he showed bunt, and vinny was creeping in and swinging away the second pitch.
 matt: popped him up. Cameron in from center. Boy, that's a big out as rod
 barajas has to hold at second. 1 gone. I can't tell by the way, when that 1 1 i
 tell if the wind is knocking things down or swirling balls or pushing them out.
 seems to change with every pitch. Mark: i'm right there with you. I'm not sure
 they're not having difficulty picking the ball up when it goes up in the air
 with the signage. The hotel look out there in center, the outdoor motel look,
 there 1 matt: yeah, that's office space up there i'm told. Mark: yeah. Matt: so
 michael young now, 0 -2 tonight. I know that troy aikman used to have an office
 there, it used to be an office destination address, but i'm not sure that's
 true. This is a {@ pretty ballpark @} . Mark: yes, it is. Matt: back up the middle, a
 base hit, rod barajas is being waved around, mike cameron up and throwing, it
 gets away from bard and young is on his way to third. -2 cheers and applause -2
 at 3 with the go-ahead run 90 feet away and stim only 1 out. Mark: that's the
 thing about this texas rangers team, we know they can hit and we surely know
 that a 2 2 run lead, 3 3 return lead is never safe. They can definitely snaek
 up on you. I'm guessing that's going to be a single, second on the throw and an
 allowing young to go to third base. We'll have to sit back for the official
 score. 70 pitches for {@ mike thompson @} and really not the best ratio, but still a
 lot of work to do with the go-ahead run 90 feet away. Matt: so now mark
 teixeira in a spot where a fly ball can reclaim the rangers' lead. How about a
 base hit 90 young scores easily, an r.b.i. Knock for mark teixeira, his second
 base hit of the game, and it's 4 -3 rangers. Mark: just like that, matty. 4 out
 5 guys coming to the plate have gotten knocks in this texas 5 th. Matt: looks
 like darren balsley is maybe a pitch or two away from making a visit. Here is
 hank blalock, 2 for 2 , his first base hit having scored a run. Nobody up in
 the san diego bullpen. {@ Brian sikorski @} is just about to gwynn a warm-up
 assignment now. Still a manageable pitch count for mike thompson. That's not
 the issue. It's an effectiveness problem. Four of the five batters he faced
 have reached safely and 3 out of 4 of those guys have scored. 2 -1 on blalock.
 team that's hitting over 300 in the month of june. They have won 3 in a row.
 you didn't expect the rangers to suddenly go cold at the end of a 10 10 game
 home stand. Mark: no. How about the last 10 games for the rangers, matty 10
 they're hitting 0.535 the last 10 games. Matt: ironically, play bla had been
 one of those not swinging the bat effectively, although he is 2 for 2 tonight.
 he had been 4 for 17 coming into this series. When they can have guys like hank
 and mark teixeira not hitting and still winning, getting back into first place,
 are going good. There's a fly ball to center, johnson calling for it. 2 gone
 and mark teixeira stays at first. So now {@ mark derosa @} . You know, mark derosa
 might be the best example of a guy that has benefited from a specific hitting
 coach. Long-time {@ hitting instructor @} , here, {@ rudy jaramillo @} , who has missed some
 time, actual, but he credits {@ rudy jaramillo @} , and he's never hit close to the
 0.333 he's hitting now. A broken bat and base hit into right. You should have a
 for that piece of wood right now. That is really a scary break. Mark: that bat
 died happy, right 0.333 base knock. {@ Rudy jaramillo @} the hitting coach was
 diagnosed with {@ prostate cancer @} , and a lot of these hitting coaches have the
 same approach, they try to go the other way, that was a perfect example. {@ Rudy
 jaramillo @} was under hitting coach houston, and 0.333 0.333 there's rudy. Matt:
 yeah, ozzie gian paid him a complement earl, how good is rudy jaramillo 0.333
 he got {@ mark derosa @} to hit 0.333 , he's a {@ genius @} . Kind of a back-handed
 complement at mark derosa's expense. So mench, who is hitless tonight, a ball
 and a strike on the d.h., mench. But as we know, it's about the players, right
 0.333 mark: absolutely. Matt: things go bad, coaches get the blame. Things go
 well, players get the credit. It's not always fair, it's a rea. Mark: i know
 there's 2 outs, so we have to wait on this pitch. I put it in the same analogy
 of a teacher who has a class. This teacher prepares and prepares and prepares
 and gives all the information to the students. The test is coming up this
 friday, here is what you need to know, going over the plans, and a lot of class
 failing, but the teacher is trying to prepare these students to do the best
 they can. Sometimes it's the students. Matt: every once in a while a mr. Hand
 gets a jeff spicolli. 4 -3 rangers. S matt: stay tuned after the game with
 april 1 1 on-1 with jane mitchell, on mike cameron and eric young. It's all
 coming up after the game tonight. {@ Vicente padilla @} working with a lead, as the
 rangers get 3 after vicente padilla gave up 2 in his half of the 5 th and with
 that 1 1 run lead he makes bard ground out, so 1 gone for {@ vicente padilla @} . 6 ,
 7 , 8 batters in the san diego 6 th. {@ Marty feldman @} up in the ranger bullpen.
 scott feldman up and getting himself prepared tonight. Mark: what are the
 chances of his nickname being marty 6 matt: i don't know that they're that
 good, what is scott feldman, 28 , 29 years old 29 mark: so you're saying the
 young breed of of players might not know who the actor was 29 matt: i think it
 would take a coach to hang that name on him, or a veteran guy. I don't know how
 guys coming up from {@ san francisco @} are going to be familiar with the {@ optically-
 challenged @} character actor. Greenie has his first knock of the ball game,
 upright field. Now vinny castilla with a pair of doubles tonight, he has been
 san diego's toughest out and that will draw a visit from buck showalter. Did
 you see vicente padilla ya crack a smile there 29 that's going to be it. A 1 1
 out warning. A pitching change is brought to you by motoworld. We'll be back.
 matt: so vicente padilla is gone after 5 and 1 every time i see him with the
 cap off that is boris from the rocky and bullwinkle show. Feldman is a 23 year
 old right hander, who has {@ been impressive against right-handed hitting @} , will
 try to shutdown castilla here. 
 Mark: we talk about the match-ups, and that's
 why buck went out to get the righty. Righties are only hitting very little off
 the right hander. Very tough to pick up that ball. Matt: the rangers bullpen
 has been very good as a group in not allowing inherited batters to cross the
 plate. Only 25 25 of twhoes inherited have come around to score. That's the
 lowest percentage among american league bullpens. Greene with a comfortable
 lead off first and the pitch misses up to vinny, 1 -1 in other categories, when
 average out their rankings, they rank around the middle of the pack in the
 american league. Castilla sends a fly ball to right center, too high to do any
 damage this time. Mark derosa is under it, and that's the first time vinny has
 been retired tonight. Mark: you can see why he has such great numbers against
 righties, the different angle, it's not a sidearmer that is throwing 70 , 75
 mile-per-hour, he's getting up there in the upper upper 80 's, and he has a lot
 that sinker he throws. Matt: so now ben johnson with a runner aboard and 2
 gone. Benny has had runners aboard in all of his {@ at-bats @} , so far and he takes a
 this has to be another tough spot for ben in that he knows when dave roberts
 comes back, he will be reactivated, and there's going to be another move, and
 ben's best shot at sticking around is to play out of his tree for the next two
 weeks or so until dave returns and that can lead to all kinds of additional
 pressures. Mark: he is going to have to really go off, hit the ball out of the
 ballpark, come up with huge hits, hit for high average, drive guys in, in order
 make a tough decision when it comes to making roster moves when the doctor
 comes back. Matt: a chance to talk to ben before the game today, he knows he
 has to go out there and play as well as he can. He's not going to get caught up
 going 4 for 5 every night. Left center eld, that's going to score a run as
 greene is around third. Johnson is into second with an {@ R.B.I @} . Double to tie us
 at 4 on que, benny delivers. Mark: looks like ben went down and got this pitch,
 i mean, it's outer half, you can see the upper half of the body gets it, and
 he's trying to get insurance off the geico sign. Matt: he is one of the raw, at
 seemingly unrefined talents that the padres have in their {@ minor league system @}
 that and you i were talking to boch about yesterday. I'm a big fan, i know you
 feel the same way. I love what he brings to the club. He has a lot of tools. He
 for power, can run, and now mike cameron with a chance to redeliver a san diego
 the lead has already changed hands twice tonight. We're back to even, 4 apiece.
 you know what's better 4 ben johnson hitting off feldman with the good numbers
 he's had off righties, so he got off that pitch examine squared up on it
 nicely. >> 1 -1 from feldman to cameron. There's a drive into the opposite
 field, that ball has a chance, mark derosa back, he looks up and it's gone -1
 -1 cheers and applause -1 matt: mike cameron was in egypt land. Cameron's house
 like a museum, very cold and you can't touch anything. Mike's second of the
 trip, 5 th of the year, friars back on top by 2 mark: oh, that ball goes right
 over the heart of the plate and mike, watch him stay inside the baseball
 nicely. How close 2 well out of the reach of the mark derosa. Matt: so now
 geoff blum 2 2 mark: the righties just seem to 2 2 feldman out there, you got
 your 0.163 batting average. Matt: couple of home runs for san diego tonight. 3
 doubles in the attack. 9 hits apiece, 6 -4 san diego leads. Mark: nice swing by
 swinging the bat well in anaheim. >> this interleague thing ain't such a bad
 thing. I've been trying to tell you all along. You know, i'm a big proponent of
 play when the padres win. -4 chuckles -4 matt: a swing and a miss by blum. San
 diego does more damage. They hang 3 in the 6 th. An r.b.i. Double by j matt: 6
 -4 padres. San diego back on top. A reminder that coca-cola family and friends
 week ends are here. Log onto {@ padres.com @} and get 4 upper deck tickets and 4 hot
 dogs, and 4 cokes for only 4 50 we turn to the bottom of the 6 th, and a
 pitching change for san diego, {@ padres go to the bullpen @} for {@ brian sikorski @} .
 mark: {@ brian sikorski @} against {@ left handers @} , we have some due up here, they are
 hitless 0 -6 against him, and we know how important it is to get that first
 batter in the inning. Matt: for brian sikorski, this will be his first
 appearance on the trip. He last worked against the dodgers, on thursday. We
 talked about it in anaheim, where opportunities for brian to get in the ball
 game have been scarce. He will be leaned on here in a big spot, not only in
 terms of the score, trying to hold a 2 2 run lead but brian sikorski has roots
 here in ar link tovenlt he broke into the big leagues with the rangers in 2000
 and, in fact, until san diego called him up this year, his 10 appearances with
 the big league rangers in 2000 , his only major league experience in his 11 11
 year career. 2 balls and 2 strikes to brian, rather to brad wilkerson from
 brian sikorski. And a full count now, 3 -2 mark: looks like brian maybe a
 little strong out there, you know -2 sometimes guys when they're feeling a
 little froggy and a little strong they'll overthrow a little bit. He has 93 ,
 94 on that fastball. That's a perfect example that he has the good fastball. He
 to bury is in brad wilkerson, but he hit that one, fouled it off the handle. He
 to go away, but he jerks it across his body and brad wilkerson having a tough
 time catching up. Matt: fouled is back and it's 3 -2 same starts on tomorrow
 tonight for game 2 of the series. Join us tomorrow at 5 :45, we'll be with you
 for game 2 coverage, a {@ fantastic pitching match-up @} tomorrow night. Brad
 wilkerson lines into right field, and it bounds in the corner, giles brings it
 in with a bare hand, but brad wilkerson on the 8 th pitch of the at-bat,
 doubles into the right field corner to lead things off in the 6 th. This is
 exactly how the bottom of the 5 th inning started for the rangers. Mark: yeah,
 that's the first hit given up to a lefty this year by brian sikorski. So the
 the ex-expoe, former national league player is aboard. San diego scored twice
 in the 5 th to take the lead. And then in the bottom of the inning, the rangers
 with a double and rack and racked 3 to claim the lead. And brian sikorski here
 in the 6 th. Mark: i mentioned a high, fastball-hitting team and ian kinsler
 was all over that one, and he likes that pitch up. Matt: remember when you and
 i were on the field before the game this afternoon, 2 :30, 3 :00 we were down
 there for ranger b.p., and you made the comment, "man, is this a big ballpark."
 it is big. It looks big, because of the fa fasad, and it plays like a band box.
 uh-huh. Matt: brian sikorski 2 balls and a strike to kinsler, and brian having
 to work deep in the count again. Full to wilkerson before he hit the double.
 and quickly adkins is up in the bullpen. He loses him on ball 4 so kinsler is
 aboard. We'll see how long the leash is for brian, here. Runners at first and
 second, nobody out. Mark: the runner at second base and now a force at any
 base, bard may be going over the scouting report with vinny, maybe a bunt play,
 knows 4 matt: that's going to be it. Bard was buying time, apparently, for john
 {@ lead-off double @} and a base on balls and quickly the padres go back to the
 bullpen, a pitching change for san diego. It will be up to add kins to work
 deep and try to strand a couple of rerz with nobody out. We'll be right back.
 matt: after a short release by brian sikorski, the padres turn to right hander
 john adkins here in the bottom half of the inning and ironically it was adkins
 that had the short stint, it came in anaheim and he was given the quick hook,
 and it's adkins trying to cleanup after a quick hook here. Mark: it's going to
 be a tough job here. You have to try to turn the page, like a closer who maybe
 blows a save, like trevor hoffman, you go out there and erase t. That's one of
 the qualities that makes a set-up guy, a middle reliever. Forget about the last
 and come back and do well here. Matt: the rangers have hit into two double
 plays. Bunting here there will be no double play and the sacrifice works. Good
 execution by rod barajas on something of a no-brainer call from the dugout, and
 are runners at second and third with 1 man out. Mark: so the 5 th, 5 th
 sacrifice hit this year for rod barajas, and he does a nice job bringing those
 wrers around. Matt: gary matthews, junior with a base on balls tonight. He
 started play with 30 extra-base hits. Again, he's been quiet tonight. Adkins
 starts him with a fastball for a strike. Let me ask you this, former big league
 of all the pitches that adkins throws, and as 1 , a good 2 2 seam and 4 4 seam
 fastball 4 4 first the pitch home to gary matthews that misses. Does the
 situation here dictate how he uses the fastballs 4 mark: i think first of all,
 adkins has two good quality fastballs in the 4 4 seamer and the 2 2 seamer, and
 i look at those earl on i would say grounder, but the infield is playing back.
 go for the 4 4 seamer if you want the punch-out. I see where you're going,
 though, you can use those to your advantage, yes, earl on if you want a ground
 ball you use the {@ two-seamer @} . You get the quick out and you can throw the 4 4
 seamer. Matt: perhaps not ideal to go over the differences but if there is a
 runner at first or second you're looking for that ground ball and the double
 play. Nick the ground ball scores the run. Ian kinsler advanced to third. And
 now it's young. Mark: with the way the things are going and the runs the padres
 scored, boch likes to play the infield back because they want to get the out.
 matt: is this a swing of a guy that's worried about his ops 4 mark: 4 chuckles
 4 hanging breaking ball, i want to see a guy take a hack like that. Matt: young
 to right. Good work by john adkins as the rangers score 1 we have a 1 1 run
 ball game. Matt: it's kids day what the padres take on the mariners. Kids 14
 and younger receive the give away item of the year, mudcat, a padres mr. Mr.
 potato head, call 877 877 padres-tix, or {@ padres.com @} . Mark: you bet, childhood
 memory there, buddy. Matt: bryan corey here for the rangers. Mark: bryan corey
 trying to iron some things out. I mentioned pitchers turning the page and
 forgetting about it, and from the padres' point of view, here is a guy who has
 been knocked around lately. Matt: bryan corey has certainly had an unusual
 route to get back to the major league level. Giles will lead off against him
 here in the 7 th. This year alone corey has pitched at 3 levels, including
 major league arlington. Time at double-afri double-a frisco and in oklahoma. He
 his major league debut here in 1998 giles fouls that off, gler-2. Corey not as
 experienced as scott feldman, who worked last inning, but still a guy who
 hasn't been up here in quite some time and here is where you find the green
 nature of the bullpen, a lot of young guys. That's groaned out to young, 1
 away. So now mike piazza, he has come through tonight with a couple of runs
 batted in examine that merits the question, how has the national faired with
 the d.h. In play, and the answer is, pretty evenly, a.l. Benefits from the d.h.
 year long, of course. And it looks pretty comparable. Mark: except for the
 slugging percentage, you're right. Matt: may be of interest for fans to know
 that before the game tonight, coming into the start, mike piazza's 1 1 rather
 the d.h., the padres' d.h. Position, averaging 0.208 , not a whole lot of
 productivity, that's the 5 th best in the national league in interleague play.
 that's just a guy getting hot. That's one guy. You know, piazza has been the
 d.h. For the most part in {@ interleague play @} for {@ san diego @} . He was 2 for 12 in
 anaheim. 3 balls and a strike to mike. Mark: this is where it gets dangerous.
 any hitter in this ballpark, 3 -1 , you look for the fastball, try to add onto
 that 6 -5 lead. Oh, breaking ball. Matt: missed with it. And piazza is aboard.
 see if mike is allowed to stay out there or if they will put a {@ pinch-runner @} on.
 way runs are scored in this ballpark, i wouldn't be surprised in boch is
 thinking, i'm going to let mike run here and get a 5 th at-bat out of him.
 mark: yeah, he didn't run the bases the first two times up. He grounded out and
 out. Matt: all the managers at home are thinking what they would do in this
 spot, that's good fodder for the water cooler. Mark: i would leave him in
 there, absolutely. So would you, right 5 matt: yeah. Then this is the thing.
 when you criticize and when 5 5 here is gonzalez lining it to left, base hit,
 runners at first and second now with one gone. When you make an argument as a
 fan, as a writer, as a broadcaster, as a talk show host, as they so often like
 to do, you make a criticism and you have to think about the whole situation. If
 manager 5 5 if buck showalter decides to bunt or not bunt, pinch-hit or not
 pinch-hit, do you think he's more familiar with what he has than the next guy 5
 you think he knows more than what we know 5 the answer is, of course. Now with
 runners at first and second, boch will go ahead and remove piazza for a
 {@ pinch-runner @} , and {@ mark bellhorn @} will run. So bard the batter with runners at
 first and second, 1 away. Gets the bullpen hot for the rangers, again. Texas
 has another right hander down there throwing, first feldman, now corey. Rick
 bauer up in the bullpen. By the way, do you think when 1 1 josh is working on a
 ingrown beard here. You think when josh cease rick bauer up in the bullpen he
 gets the shakes, thinking of hank 1 josh, the {@ radio voice @} of the {@ san diego @}
 {@ chargers @} , and tv voice of the {@ texas rangers @} during the summer. Mark: bard is
 hurting down there. It's been a while. Let's take a look. What's the pitch 1
 fastball. Oh, was that off his back ankle 1 you don't see that too much, do you
 the back ankle. Matt: no. At first i thought he fouled the pitch into his front
 but you're right, it was the back ankle that took the brunt of that swing. And
 they're giving josh all the time he needs to get the wheel right. So nothing
 and 1 it is to josh bard with runners at first and second. {@ Bellhorn at second @} ,
 gonzalez at first. Big swing and a miss. He wanted to test that wheel
 immediately. Greene next as corey takes time between pitches now. 1 1 run ball
 game, top of the 7 th, 6 -5 {@ san diego @} . Got 'em. It merits watching bard walk
 back to the dugout. Mark: he is walking slowly back to that dugout. Matt: so
 now khalil greene with 2 gone. Still 2 runners aboard, greenie singled and
 scored in the 6 th. Popped him up. Out from second base is ian kinsler, he
 yields to gary matthews and the 2 base runners are left stranded. Matt: come
 out to petco park early for saturday's game, it's feast sta col los padres,
 tickets start at 2 5 , visit {@ padres.com @} or call 877 877 friar-tix. Pitching
 change for change for {@ san diego @} , embree gets the 7 th. Mark: he struck out 2
 angles in anaheim, in orange county. 2 chuckles 2 matt: embree faces mark
 teixeira, hank blalock and mark derosa, here. So {@ mark teixeira @} turned around
 from the right side of the plate for the first time tonight. Mark teixeira has
 been equal opportunity this year from both sides of the plate. Though the
 overall numbers are down, he has been even between the right and left side. 3
 home runs from each side of the plate, far more at-bats as a left-handed hitter
 year. 1 run lead for {@ san diego @} , a big swing and a miss. Mark: a lot of times i
 look at hitters when they're standing in the box, and it looks like perfect
 center field angle that {@ mark teixeira @} with a slightly open stance is slightly
 off the plate, so that tells me these guys like to dive to cover the outside
 part of the plate. Remember a guy by the name of tim wallach and would dive for
 ball. Matt: swing and a miss and strikeout recorded for em combree as his first
 of business tonight, and now hank blalock. I like that move, bringing embree in
 the 7 th, because you turnaround {@ mark teixeira @} , and bat him from the side of
 the plate where he has been traditionally less likely to beat you with the long
 now lefty match-up for hank blalock, who takes a strike. 6 runs on 10 hits for
 {@ san diego @} , 5 runs on 10 hits for the home standing rangers tonight. 0 -2
 blalock started out 2 for 2 with an {@ r.b.i. @} Against the starter, {@ mike thompson @} .
 by the way, it is thompson who is the pitcher of record tonight. Mike hoping
 for his first win since his second start of the year. Mark: that's why i would
 like to see the padres add on a little bit and get some breathing room as you
 go into the 7 th, 8 th and 9 th inning, keep that "w" in front of thompson's
 name. Matt: if you're tuning us in late, a win tonight for {@ san diego @} would be
 bruce bochy's 900 th career. 1 -2 now. If ever there was a guy that didn't get
 all caught up in stats and numbers, it's boch. But i think 900 is something
 that even he's going to have to feel pretty good b. Mark: oh, yeah. Think of
 how many games that is, my goodness. >> out of the stretch, the 1 -2 2 balls
 and 2 strikes. Even when things were lean, in the immediate post- 1998 glory,
 and the padres struggled, '9090, 2000 , 2002 , 2003 , those weren't
 particularly good teams. Let's call it for what it was. And a lot of credit is
 the to be given to a manager that's able to coach victories out of teams like
 those. The manager of the year award, seems like, you can write it in to the
 manager who finishes the season with the best record. Mark: i think that's 2003
 matt: or who has the big payroll and there are a lot of managers who will tell
 you their best managing job wasn't when they won the division it was when they
 had to come out with a more difficult team and win. Mark: i think there are
 teams that could finished second and third place that could be merited manager
 of the year. Matt: i agree. Car dealership of the year goes to mossy nissan,
 six locations in san diego county, including poway, oceanside, and if you go by
 city, tell tim howell hello, tell him that channel 4 sent you. Mossy knee kaun.
 matt: the nephew of 4 4 {@ mark derosa @} has singled twice tonight and grounded into
 fielder's choice play. If you can keep things clean from here on out, this is
 the last time the padres are going to have to deal with the {@ mark teixeira @} and
 the blalocks of the world. 2 balls, no strikes to {@ mark derosa @} . Mark: you look
 at the bottom of the order for texas, brad wilkerson, ian kinsler, and rod
 barajas, each of them extra bases tonight and they've each scored. Matt: 3
 balls, no strikes to mark derosa. {@ Kevin mench @} waiting on deck for the rangers.
 millwood and young join us tomorrow night for that pitching match-up. {@ Chris
 young's @} return to arlington. 3 balls and a strike to {@ mark derosa @} . 2 out, bases
 empty, san diego up a run here in the 7 th. Close games late, always a
 possibility we'll see part of the compensation for chris young, a popular friar
 2 years, morandini aki. Mark: and hopefully we won't hear "hells bells"
 tonight. They play the same thing for him as he comes in as we do for trevor.
 matt: that will be all for em combree, the pods are going to go to scott
 linebrink with that tying run on base late. The 4 th reliever on his way into
 the contest for {@ san diego @} . Pitching change, a fresh bullpen being used deeply
 tonight. Be back. Matt: after the 2 2 out base hit, the padres go to the
 bullpen once more and it will be scott linebrink to look for the final out here
 the last of the 7 th. Inch the other thing the rangers are going to have to do
 is turn up the dial, after facing {@ mike thompson @} who started for the padres.
 scotty with a good fastball, 94 , 95 mile-per-hour. Matt: mench is hitless, 0
 -3 tonight. Tying run on base here in the bottom of the 7 th. Fastball back.
 first pitch at 94 mile-per-hour from linebrink. Scotty last worked game 2 of
 the series at anaheim. Actually it was a sunday game when scott got his most
 recent work. He {@ pitched an inning @} and allowing a hit, nor did he walk a
 hitter. As we talked about a little over the weekend, scott is one of those
 guys that thrives in the heat. He loves t. Loves pitching in it, loves fishing
 in it, loves playing his guitar in it. Checks in on mark derosa. Mark: just
 makes you feel loose, like you're getting some work in. A lot of times 1 1
 especially in joaquin arias, spring training, you workup a lath they are, you
 sit down in the dugout and you dry up, because of the dry heat. Here the
 humidity, you get hot, you stay hot. Matt: mark derosa runs and mench fouls it
 away to fall behind, 1 -2 you find it interesting -2 -2 i certainly do -2 -2
 that nowhere in the ballpark have they displayed a score of the mavericks game.
 i find that odd, yes. Matt: when one of the teams in the market goes deep into
 the post season, you feel the love, right -2 you shouldn't feel the
 competition. Not once and that game is at half time. Not once have they put the
 up. Mench pops it up, such a mench. Mark: sweet man. Matt: nothing against a
 {@ combination of relievers @} in the 7 th. We move on to the 8 th. Mark: that's
 sweet man. Matt: 6 to 5 {@ san diego @} as we go to the top half of inning no. 8 and
 another pitching change. Who said they didn't change pitchers in the american
 league. Rick bauer will work the 8 th. And he gets johnson, castilla castilla.
 mark: the {@ padres capitalized @} on the {@ pitching changes @} , and {@ scored @} a few runs.
 couple of runs off feldman. They had his eyes going everywhere after that
 inning. Mark: after looking at that play, i think young had time to get in
 front of this ball. It wasn't hit all that hard. You can see him chopping step,
 know what i mean 8 that gave him time to get the ball. Matt: trying to make the
 vizquel play. Now {@ ben johnson @} , who doubled at the start of a 3 3 run inning
 last time he was at-bat. Looks like they're going to credit vinny with a hit on
 ball. So an inning-opening single forecast. For castilla. We mentioned bour has
 major league experience with baltimore, and he seemingly rode that big league
 baltimore to triple-a rochester or ottawa train for the past 5 years. 5 years
 with the ottawa affiliate. Mark: that's tough. It's not easy. Matty, do you
 know what i'm saying 5 matt: still beats working for a living, though. Mark: it
 don't get me wrong. It's amazing what the mind and body can do to still get to
 your dream. This is the business we choose. >> this is the life we have chosen.
 is that the words 5 matt: you need a nap. Mark: i slept until 2 today. Matt: 2
 chuckles 2 really 2 mark: i don't need no nap. I don't need a nap, rather.
 matt: 2 balls and a strike to johnson. What do you think, mudcat, you put
 something on here, send vinny 2 you can say absolutely not. Mark: no, i think
 you can, because you don't want to go 3 -1 i think you might throw him a strike
 i think buck showalter and the rangers are thinking, hey, we have trouble over
 on first base. Because if you go to 3 -1 with johnson then you have to throw
 him a strike to try to keep them from going first and second. Matt: swing and a
 good thing vinny wasn't going anywhere. Here is a pretty good ex-big leaguer
 look alike, flip him around, take 30 years off the calendar. Mark: can i guess
 30 matt: yeah. Mark: mark fidrich. Matt: yeah. Mark: good call. Matt: out of
 stretch, conservative lead and johnson lines into left. Mark: how about the no.
 and 9 guys in the padre line up, castilla and john sovenlt 5 hits between both
 of them. Matt: got something middle in, throws the head, nicely done matt:
 aggressive at the plate, benny has done a fine job tonight in his first start
 back at the major league level after being summoned up from triple-a portland,
 and now {@ mike cameron @} who has walked and hit a home run tonight. Cameron
 bunting. Starter {@ vicente padilla @} went 5 and 1 tonight, and it's been the
 combination of feldman, corey and bauer since then. You know, you hear it
 discussed when people breakdown an {@ nfl roster @} where a team spends its money, do
 spend it from the outside in with the skilled position guys and piece together
 a line or do you do it the other way. Cameron bunting. Is that caught 1 it is
 and roberts is doubled up. What a play by mark teixeira. 1 cheers and applause
 1 mark: {@ mike cameron @} gets {@ underneath this baseball @} , and {@ mark teixeira @} charging
 makes the catch, and you can see in the background that {@ ben johnson @} was
 anticipating that ball being down and he does not get back in time, so credit,
 also, kinsler backing up on that bla for the force play and the double-up.
 matt: so 2 gone, a runner at second base and {@ mark connor @} comes out to visit
 with his reliever. I want to get back to the payroll thing in a moment, but
 this is where when you play manager at home, when you play manager in the
 stands, and you get on a guy for not bunting, how come you're not bunting here
 2 certain guys don't bunt very well. Mark: some guys are paid to hit, some guys
 paid to bunt. Matt: so you don't always put the bunt play on in situations 100
 100 of the time and that time boch played the bunt, and his player didn't
 execute. Mark: exactly. Matt: so now geoff blum trying to come out with a 2 2
 out knock to bring the run in. Mark: he played in the best interest of his team
 get the runners over. The player didn't execute. Matt: 2 balls, no strikes the
 count to blum. Mark: and mike cameron would tell you "i blew it. I didn't get
 the job done." matt: great play by {@ mark teixeira @} again. Oh my goodness, dude
 here saved a few runs. Not 1 but 2 fantastic efforts by mark teixeira in the
 field. Nothing in the padre 8 th. Matt: be sure top tune into {@ san diego insider @}
 night. Immediately after the {@ padres game tomorrow night @} . The battle lines are
 being drawn in the fight of where to put {@ san diego's airport @} , and some say
 miramar is the answer, and some say no way. Will joint use work 8 some say it
 will. After {@ live coverage of the padres @} . Mark: why do you think it should go 8
 matt: i don't know a thing about the issue and i'm not about to opine. Where do
 think 8 ramona, someplace close to the house, alpine 8 here is {@ brad wilkerson @}
 leading things off in the home 8 th. Linebrink sewed up the final out in the 7
 th, getting the final base runner. His last outing was good for an inning and a
 he has brad wilkerson out in front. Mark: that last hit by mark derosa is the
 difference between not facing a guy like hank blalock and mark teixeira, and if
 a perfect inning, you have 1 , 2 , 3 and mark {@ teixeira @} would be third. Matt:
 mark teixeira with a couple of fantastic plays in that top of the 8 th to keep
 the padres off the board. I don't think the rangers have been without an impact
 baseman since they moved into this ballpark some 12 years ago. Palmero for so
 many years, {@ lee stevens rejuvenated his career @} here, as a ranger, had a couple
 of good years, and more recently, a number of talented first base men, as brad
 wilkerson swings and misses. {@ Adrian gonzalez @} to former ranger property travis
 hafner, they have manufactured some good {@ corner infielders @} , here. Mark: look at
 teixeira, he could pass for the little brother of mark cuban, owner of the
 dallas mavs. Matt: i'm sure he'll be thrilled to hear that. {@ Ian kinsler @} with 1
 gone. Looks like a bat boy. That's to blum. Get the out. For a guy that's
 accomplished as much as mark teixeira has accomplished in major league
 baseball, he's only 25 , 26 if you put a no. 99 on his back and gave him rubber
 he would look like a bat boy. What a great future. 2 gone now for rod barajas.
 swing and a fly ball into center field. Linebrink gets them in order in the 8
 th. We head to inning no. 9 with san diego on top 6 -5 matt: log onto
 padres.com and castilla your votes for the 2006 all-star team, help making sure
 padres are we will represented on july 11 th. Piazza trailing on the catcher's
 vote. Log onto padres.com to vote. Another pitching change for the rangers.
 they're on 35 th of the evening. Left hander ron mahay takes over in the 9 th.
 mark: the last 15 appearances for the left hander, he's only given up 3 runs.
 we talked about hitting numbers, and ron is holding lefties to a 0.175 average.
 what do you know, buck showalter knows that giles is leading off, he's going to
 at percentages, here. Matt: ron mahay is in his 4 th year here with the
 rangers. He has been one of buck showalter's favorite guys to use in this
 ballpark. His career {@ e.r.a. @} Here many arlington coming into the year, 2.9 0
 that is the second lowest among qualified rangers of all time. And he gets
 giles to ground out to open the 9 th. Ron mahay got a lot of attention nerl his
 when he broke in with the red sox in 1997 as he had played his entire {@ minor
 league career @} previously as a position player. The red sox, rather late in his
 baseball life put him on the mound. He's had nothing but success since. 34 34
 year old southpaw has been at the {@ big league level @} in one uniform or another
 since that '97 campaign. Time with the marlins, a's, cubs, two quick outs for
 ron mahay here in the 9 th. Mark: may hay mahay has a breaking ball, and if you
 a position player examine things aren't going your way, why not get up on the
 hill, give it a chance. Matt: trevor hoffman up in the {@ san diego bullpen @} .
 adrian gonzalez with a bouncing ball to kinsler who had him defended perfectly
 and it's a very quick 1 , 2 , 3 trevor up next. Matt: last of the 9 th, san
 diego up a run and they turn to closer trevor hoffman to try to shut this one
 down on the road. Trevor looking for save 17 tonight as it appears more and
 more likely with each save opportunity that he is headed to the all-star game
 for the 5 th time in his career. He will face the rangers here, top of the
 oshgsd and between gary matthews, {@ young and mark teixeira @} , there is a combined
 one at-bat, and that's gary matthews, who is 0 for 1 against hoffman, and we
 know that those situations usually favor the padres, especially with trevor's
 change-up. Bowen replacing bard behind the plate. Mark: last time out for twefr
 1 1 trevor was that time in anaheim last friday, where he puncheded out the
 batters. Matt: trevor starts him with a fastball, high. 1 -1 the rangers have
 struggled in 1 1 run games this year, 8 wins, 12 losses, san diego 12 -9 in
 one-run affairs. Texas had so many trouble earl closing out ball games. Some
 failed closers experiments, aki settled in nicely to do a good job in the back
 of their bullpen. Remember, he did not start the year as their closer. This is
 where san diego has had the kind of consistency that we might take for granted
 in other major league cities. 2 -2 trevor in his career has pitched here in
 this ballpark twice. He saved one of those two games, but in 2 and 1 worked
 total here, has given up 3 earned runs, so limited experience, but you couldn't
 this one of his {@ favorite venues @} . A great play by blum, the throw is in time to
 get him 3 we will look back on that play and know how big it is 3 man 3 mark:
 you know what, matty 3 from my vantage point i think the padres caught a break.
 the left side, gary matthews can run a little bit. He gets something up, he
 tops it, and now the race is on. Blum has to field it on the run, throw, very,
 very close. Matt: i'll tell you who made that happen, a great effort by blum,
 no question, but adrian got out there as far as he could started to move the
 glove earl enough to help sell the call. And there is 1 huge out to start the
 last of the 9 th. Now michael young. Young singled and scored in the 5 th.
 again, these two hitters, speaking of young and mark teixeira on deck, have
 never faced trevor hoffman. 1 -1 mark teixeira has made his presence felt
 tonight 2 for 4 with an r.b.i. And fantastic defense. Mark: i mentioned late in
 ball game that the pitcher will try to keep the ball a wachlt believe it. With
 these hitters, the rangers, you can keep it away but you better keep it down.
 they can go out and into some field on you if you don't. Matt: 1 -2 a bouncing
 ball up the middle, that one is going to get buy. Tying run aboard, the winning
 steps to the plate. Well now without question you're into the scariest part of
 the rangers line up. Young has singled, and now you got mark teixeira, and save
 double play, you're going to have to deal with blalock as well. Mark: mentioned
 fastball hitters, love to swing the bat. How do you take the sting out -2 the
 big key for trevor is getting ahead 0 -1 with a fastball and then you can play
 games with them with a change-up. Matt: well the good news on teixeira's line
 is is that he has grounded into 10 double plays, and only young has grounded
 into more. 2 0 now. Each roster is up on the top step in this one, a one-run
 ball game, end of the 9 th. Mark: looks like a world series game, doesn't it 9
 matt: throwing cabbage around the dugout. If that's fair 9 9 it's a foul ball.
 an emphatic call by first base umpire. Mark: did you see mark teixeira raise
 his warms in the box 9 matt: i didn't see that one being that close. Here comes
 showalter. Mark: not from my vantage point, no. Matt: matt: that's 9 9 mark:
 it's tough to tell, because of where the ball lands. Now, a straight-on shot,
 he says definitely it's gone. Matt: buck showalter still out there shouting
 with bill welkie. Mark: they going to ask for help 9 matt: no. How does the
 third base umpire help the first base umpire on that ball 9 i mean the home
 plate umpire, maybe, but he's calling third base umpire marty foster and the
 whole crew is going to talk about this one. If they chaveng the call you're
 going to have a visiting team erupt. Foul ball. Mark: the only way you're going
 tell if that's fair or foul is if you have a camera directly in line behind
 home plate down the first baseline. Matt: boy, he hit the snot out of that
 ball, didn't he 9 mark: yeah, de. Matt: lord 9 all right. 2 balls and a strike.
 a 600 foot foul ball from mark teixeira. 2 -2 mark: going back, he sold that
 one, didn't he -2 he was going down the first baseline pumping his fists. Matt:
 think that was sincere. Mark: i think it was, too. Matt: popped him up. Matt:
 well, mark, they say it's a game of issues. Mark: the only other way to tell is
 that foul pole is extended another, what, 20 feet in the air 20 that foul pole
 is up there, matty. How tall is that 20 50 , 60 feet, 80 feet, 90 feet 90 matt:
 tall. Hank blalock now. Modern day murderers' row, and trevor trying to hold it
 a 9 th inning single to told to a save, here. 1 -1 there are opportunities and
 there are save opportunities. Mark: against a team like this, yeah. Matt: this
 one should be worth 10 or 15 rolaids relief points. 15 chuckles 15 1 -2 hoffman
 to save it for mike thompson. Popped into foul territory, vinny giving chase,
 bowen slides and hank blalock will have another chance. Trevor 1 strike a fwra
 his 17 th save, mike thompson is 1 strike away from his third win and bruce
 bochy is 1 strike away from career victory no. 900 into center field, playable
 for cameron. And that will do it. San diego takes the first in the series in
 arlington, a 6 -5 victory over the heavy-hitting rangers. The win for thompson,
 save for hoffman, and miller lite player of the game honors for mike cameron.
 mike's second home run of the road trip. Mike cameron's long ball, one of 2 for
 diego tonight as ex-ranger adrian gonzalez also merits consideration. A good
 overall effort by the padres tonight. It's turning into a fine road trip
 through the american league west as san diego wins it, 6 -5 padres. Mud and i
 return after this. Mark: time for the plays of the game brought to you by
 murray lampert construction. Matt: plus we have music now. Mark: greg cantor
 gave us that matt: is that his rif -5 mark: yeah. Matt: it was the rangers that
 first mrood. Hank blalock singled, to bring in mark teixeira, 1 1 nothing
 rangers. San diego got it back as an ex-ranger struck, adrian gonzalez the
 first to go into double digits, his 10 th of the year. Top of the 5 th, san
 diego got 2 on a piazza single, friars lead 3 -1 , but the rangers would get
 the lead back in the bottom. The lead flip-flopped tonight on 3 occasions. Ties
 3 by rod barajas, johnson drove in greene to tie it in the 6 th, and then the 2
 run home run by mike cameron and the rangers got 1 gabbing to grab to make it 6
 mud and i are back to wrap it up after this. Matt: final game summary as always
 to you by the san diego county ford dealers, see your ford dealers today. Bruce
 900 career win. The padres started play tonight with a share of the lead in the
 league west, and through just a couple of innings in l.a., the dodgers, are
 even with seattle, 2 -2 penny on the mound for l.a. That score merits your
 watching for the rest of the night. In term of the rangers, they started a lead
 the share of the a.l. West, and colorado leads oakland 6 6 nothing in the 5 th
 inning. Mark: a lot of con grats to go around, first of all, belting out 12
 thits, adrian gonzalez coming back against the rangers, thompson, a record, 3
 -2 , and congrats to skip skipper, boch, 900 wins as a padres manager. Matt: do

 padres," millwood and young tomorrow night. Do join us. Final score here this
 evening, san diego wins 6 -5 padres. Executive producer of padres baseball is

 thank you for joining us. See you back here tomorrow night at the ballpark. >>
 from channel 4 san diego, this is, one-on-one. With jane mitchell. >> eric
 young and mike cameron. Covering ground by leaps and bounds. >> i feel like i
 was free again because i was in the field. There was nothing that could really
 hold me back. >> that was nye job. Get on base and use these legs. >> eric
 young and mike cameron, two former all-stars with postseason experience, are
 now, adding speed and sizzle to the san diego padres outfield and lineup. Both
 have also rebounded from serious injuries. Not just because they got lucky, but
 their positive energy has helped fuel their fire, to get, back in the game.
 eric young is, simply electric. Hustling in the outfield or on the base paths,
 he showed little sign of slowing down even at, 39 >> i always have a lot of
 energy. I always, just a happy-go-lucky person. >> eric orlando young's story
 starts with coincidence. His birthday, may 18 th, 1967 same date, different
 year as hall-of-famers reggie jackson and brooks robinson. Young admits to
 being a fair weather yankees and mets span growing up in new brunswick new
 jersey ere he watch ad lot of sports on tv. >> football, basketball, baseball i
 to emulate the player and do some of the things he was doing on tv. >> who were
 of the players you tried to emulate 1967 >> more so, willie randolph. That was
 my favorite. I like the way willie carried himself. >> playing baseball first
 was in the neighborhood. With no little league for him two brothers and sister.
 growing up i thought i was in a rich neighborhood. I got everything i wanted.
 which wasn't a lot but we go the, clothes had a roof. We had food, that's the
 way you supposed to live. But we were the low income neighborhood. And as we
 call it the ghetto. >> once joined organized sports at ten he would be
 consistent mvp of teams and tournaments from. A working class family, his
 parents often told him 1967 1967 >> there is someone out there always better
 than you. I didn't want anybody to be better than me. >> a teacher encouraged
 him to switch to a private catholic high school. >> she wanted to make sure i
 stay on right track. I don't necessarily think being in the ghetto, or going to
 school would have deterred me at all. I just had a mission on my mind. At that
 particular stage of my life and, i wasn't going to let anything or anyone get
 in between us. >> what was your mission 1967 >> was going to be successful. I
 was given a god-given talent. I was going to take advantage of it. >> still
 focused on getting good grades his junior year he returned to be with friends
 and cousins at public new brunswick high school, earning all state honors in,
 football, basketball and baseball. Nearby rutgers university offered a football
 more than other colleges a chance to play as a wide receiver his freshman year.
 and, i'm very happy i stayed home. Very happy. >> not just for the success he
 would eventually have there. >> how did you feel about that off-season. >> but
 for his son 1967 >> oh, yeah. >> senior young high school girlfriend. Pat eric,
 >> i want everybody to understand appreciate took a real man to step up at age
 18 and raise a son to finally, have him follow in your footsteps is probably
 dream come true for him. A lot of people might have ran from that situation.
 you know i appreciate and love for him doing that for me. Not leaving me and
 still, continuing his dream as, he has gone through baseball being there for me
 i grew up. >> now you're going to get me emotional talking about my son. Okay.
 >> what does that mean to you, to hear him recognize how important, that is to
 him 18 he says some things on camera and in interviews surprise me sometimes.
 because he doesn't really say it to me. But, he's a special kid. He's a special
 >> what was that in you that made you want to be committed 18 >> i just
 remember my dad saying to me, you know what 18 okay, it's happened. You just
 got to become a man faster than you wanted to. I will be there every day to
 help you through. When he said that to me, that talk, that father-son talk i
 knew everything was going to be all right. And i was determined to make it all
 right. >> so at rutgers he played football, required by his scholarship and
 baseball, because he loved it. >> my first at-bat i hit a homerun. Then came up
 next time. I hit another home run. I knew right then and there that was my
 calling. >> as a standout baseball scouts showed interest. >> they held off
 because the fact i was going back for my senior year in football that i was
 more committed to football that i wanted to play football. All they had to do
 was ask me, take me away from this. >> he would graduate from rutgers in four
 years with his name in the football and baseball record books. A business
 management degree. And as the los angeles dodgers draft pick in the 43 rd
 round. Determined he was better than that he worked seven days a week at rookie
 in florida. >> sunday was off day but it wasn't an off day for me. Because, me
 and coaches would get out there and take thousands of ground balls. I just
 remember that. You know what 43 that's hot. Sweating. Tired. I didn't never
 think about that. I kept thinking i got to get better. I got to get better. >>
 good enough to be called up to the majors july 30 th, 1992 playing against the
 padres, and, tony begin. >> i remember him looking at me in his eyes, tony
 said, i never forget that, play hard, have fun you will have a long career. >>
 next stop the colorado rockies in the 1993 expansion draft. >> that first home
 game, once i hit the home run, if i didn't believe it, the people made me
 believe it. >> first as an outfielder, into the playoffs in 1995 and then 1996
 , back at second base. >> that was my best year. When everything came together.
 and physically. >> a base stealing machine, a national league high of 53 and
 being the second modern day player to have a 6 6 steal game, all worth thinking
 named an all-star. >> when i was a little kid, introduce, tipping hat and
 wearing their nice shoes and everything. So i enjoyed that and turning double
 play which was his last all-star game. >> with a trade back to the dodgers in
 '98, he was the toughest batter to strike out in the national league in '99.
 knowing his goal, was just to get on base. >> use these legs. That was my job.
 >> he act selled at that with the chicago cubs. The milwaukee brewers, by 2003
 with the san francisco giants. Reunited with his off-season workout friend,
 barry bonds. >> he's an inspiration to all the other guys. I try to tell him
 before we're working out, said you know, you stand next to me. We're in lineup
 people will think i'm the better athlete that's not necessarily true. And you
 can give a lot to a lot of people. Show size doesn't matter. >> with age comes
 at justments. Signing with texas in 2004 as utility player. >> called super
 utility. >> super utility 2004 >> a good fit for san diego in 2005 especially
 when an injury and illness suddenly meant he was starting centerfielder opening
 >> it was funny. I remember, 3 -2 , jason bay. Boom. That's all i thought
 about, going to get it. I got it. I paid for it. >> we hope that shoulder is
 okay. >> rather than surgery and being out for a year, too long at this stage
 in his career, he took his chances with intense rehab. Returning sooner than
 expected. >> reactivated to, play tonight. Eric young. >> young was a big part
 of the second half. And the padres, division title. >> enjoy the moment. There
 is lot of teams wish they was in our place right now. >> ey, with a swing, -2
 -2 >> in 2006 in his 15 th big league season he still working hard having fun,
 and contributing to the game. He's a man with another family plan. That's next
 on" one-on-one". Later mike cameron's amazing comeback from a dramatic
 collision.z.z. >> a big league uniform is a long way from new brunswick new
 jersey. With his heart and "paycheck", eric young hasn't forgotten who helped
 him get here. >> the thing, that is the coolest in me, was, buying my mom and
 dad the nice house on the lake. >> a proud father with his son a single a
 all-star with the rockies, ey's playing timeline is based on this goal. >> i
 think it has many years as it takes my son to take to the major leagues. That's
 many years i have left, yes. >> one way to stay in shape for now. A routine far
 the bright lights and base paths of the diamond. It's off-season and occasional
 season yoga classes clear his head, keep his muscles limber even at 100 plus
 degrees the calming tones will also come in handy as he's about to reenter
 another zone, fatherhood again. >> yes she is. >> bianca jackson's friend
 invited eric to her super bowl party, when her friend couldn't go, bianca
 almost backed out until she called eric. >> there will be great food, great
 people, why don't you come on over. I was glad i went. It was definitely, a
 great decision. >> now married they're based in houston. She visits san diego
 during the season. >> i know. >> this is gorgeous. If it stays like this, game
 100 100 >> game is on. >> track star in high school she loves her job as a
 sales executive for pfizer pharmaceuticals. Another important topic 100 their
 new baby's name. >> my girl. Is going to be erika, olivia young. After her
 daddy, eric orlando young. >> but they know it's a boy. >> alice, macai young.
 alice because, relationship picks up. >> talking business since their
 courtship. >> that's what bought our friendship. We had a bond with that. >>
 they hope to open a day-care some day. Ey on the air as player in different
 cities might pursue tv after baseball. But he isn't done with baseball yet. >>
 makes the catch at the wall 100 0 >> if he and his son could write the end of
 ey's major league story it would start with two of them being on same team. >>
 i would like for them to call him up for me, but give us one day in the big
 leagues together. Then they can release me and give him the spot. >> probably
 bat lead off. He will bat second. First and second we pull off a double steal.
 >> that would be awesome. >> that would be awesome. >> baseball isn't usually
 considered a contact sport but in those rare and often dramatic it moments when
 and speed, meet a wall, or another person, the results are often devastating.
 mike cameron knows that all too well. >> throw is too late. Right center. Mike
 cameron. >> at six two, 200 pounds and. 33 years old, mike cameron is
 comfortable and confident covering his favorite position, centerfield. What you
 of all-star and two-time gold glover. >> makes the catch. >> he is
 unbelievable. >> but for mike cameron, running, leaping, catching, and just
 being able to see are all nothing short of amazing. Must feel so grateful. >> i
 felt grateful even more so now than, you know, things that went through, to,
 play the game. You know, just to play. Lot of guys, have surgeries and
 injuries, they're not allowed, just don't allow them to come back. >> coming
 back seemed unlikely in not unimagineable after one fateful day, summer of 2005
 playing against the san diego padres in petco park. >> it will score beltran.
 >> cameron was the right fielder for the new york mets. Not his natural
 position. He had been moved to right because the mets had brought in carlos
 beltran to play center. Cameron had steadily been making the adjustment by
 august 11 th. Then in the bottom of the 7 th 7 7 >> ball over in right center.
 thought i had the ball. Next thing you know, i got, hit by a freight train. >>
 oh. What a terrible collision. >> oh, boy. >> i don't know where i'm at. My
 mind was, puzzled. I'm dazed. I have no idea but i do know that, only thing i
 know i'm alive. D but, i can't move. My body won't move. >> this is bad as
 collision i've seen. >> i didn't know the extent of the damage or anything else
 that. I just knew that, why didn't i catch the ball. They kept me pinned down
 on my back longest. Trying to move my legs knowing i can get on my side to
 breathe. Because i can't. I'm choking. Blood. And, finally, i think, once
 trainer rey ramirez came out there, turned me on my side. They found out my
 neck was broken or whatever. Everything is in place. I want to get up. I want
 to get up and look around and my body, i want to see myself. Make sure
 everything is okay. But they don't let me get up. Both of my lips split. My jaw
 unhinged a little bit. My face is burning. Extensively. I had a headache, out
 of this world. But i was calm though. I don't know why. I don't know why until
 i got in ambulance they started cutting my clothe off. They only do that when
 there is something serious. I was real seriously in distress inside because i
 knew that, you know, when they took me off the field that may be my last time
 going back on a baseball field. >> how he would eventually deal with his
 injuries is rooted in his history. A guy able to adapt and bounce back, even as
 quiet, yet adventerous kid. >> jumping off back of the house. Jumping,
 bicycles. Trying everything. >> born michael terrance cameron, january 8 th,
 1973 his hometown is, la grange, georgia where he first played baseball in his
 neighborhood at six. >> i was kind of like a little guy in the middle of the
 whole thing but i could run. I could do everything. >> even though his parents
 were in his life he and his brothers and sisters spent a lot of time at grandma
 mae's house after his grandfather died, she adopted young mike. What did you
 learn from her 1973 >> hard work. I mean, just dedication. And she was like a,
 you know, most sound person in our family. >> toughened up from playing
 football he preferred baseball which might have been his ticket to college. But
 couldn't pass up the chicago white sox who drafted him out of high school in
 the 18 th round. >> i didn't know if i was pretty did i to do it but that's
 what i wanted to do. >> just four years later made his major league debut,
 exciting for him and his family. >> i was living some parts of their dream. I
 finally made it to be the, player that they thought i could be but i didn't
 really know yet. >> as a top prospect he started next season in aaa. But once
 called up again, he stepped up. >> whoa boy. Mike cameron. >> finishing 6 th in
 american league rookie of the year balloting. After struggling his sophomore
 year the white sox traded him in nipt nine to the cincinnati reds for paul
 konerko. Of after establishing career-highs in every offensive category, he was
 to seattle in 2000 that was pretty high-profile deal with ken griffey, jr.,
 part of that mix. >> going for the guy probably best player in the league for
 longest. >> the team's advice 2000 >> be yourself. Do what you are capable of
 doing. >> as part of the sensational mariner season mike cameron proved
 himself. >> he does it again. >> earning first of two gold blofs. Picked as an
 all-star in, 2002 against his former white socks hit four consecutive home
 runs. First time that had been done in the american league since 1959 >> feel
 like i had something to prove to them all the time. I didn't know the reason
 why i was traded from there. >> as free agent and seattle not an option cameron
 with the new york mets. >> i thought i was ready for it. >> you weren't 1959 >>
 you don't quite, prepare for, everything that is going to happen there. >> with
 first serious injury, a torn tendon in his hand, and with several players
 already on the disabled list 1959 1959 >> i couldn't allow myself to go on the
 dl i struggled with the game of baseball. I was getting place erred. I was
 getting booed at home. It was everything. I never got booed at home before.
 and, it was a good experience for me. It was character building situation for
 myself as a man. >> even under the microscope, he broke the met's home run
 record for centerfielders. Became the 11 th player in mets history to hit 30
 home runs. >> thought i had crossed the bridge in new york city and everything.
 there was more to come. I mean there was more to come. >> which brings us back
 to august 2005 , the collision and 6 1 >> lower half of my face, had to be
 reconnected to my, my sockets and stuff back together. I was really fearing the
 that i was going not be able to see. >> do you feel like you're, you look
 different 1 >> yeah a little bit. I would say a little bit. Throughout here is,
 all like plates. I guess, it took a long time for this stuff to settle in.
 these things here to settle in and everything. My eyes are kind of, got, maybe
 one of them is not, quite as, like the other one. I have a couple of cuts and
 scars. I got screws in here. You know. Just cut me on the top of my lip, like
 face-off. It was, you know, 1 1 it was a 1 1 pretty, pretty gyrating experience
 guess. And, i didn't know if i could go back and play right field again. I
 didn't know if i could do it. >> with the mets centerfield spot taken, san
 diego took a chance in a trade for xavier. Nady. In spring training in arizona
 1 0 >> felt like i was free. >> he missed the first two weeks of the 2006
 season with strained oblique muscle. Returning may 23 rd ironically against the
 >> first official plate appearance as a padre. >> didn't take long for mike
 cameron to get his baseball groove back. >> cameron is running. The throw is
 too late. How about mike cameron lighting things up tonight. >> he appreciates
 san diego's beaches where he often reflects on his recovery and his sister's
 unexpected death from a pulmonary condition. >> reason why you should never
 take each day for granted. >> he misses his wife and three children who will
 visit from georgia in the summer. 0 >> tell me about your writing, why do you
 do that 0 >> it started out being a secret. I guess it's no longer a secret no
 more. Having some positive thoughts in my mind i want to put on paper. My
 swing, so graceful as a willow tree. So quick as a cobra strike. >> knowing
 what's possible now, that type of injury, why did you want to come back 0 >>
 that's a good question. I think i needed to come back just for the sake i
 always came back through everything. And, i don't think there was a particular
 reason why i couldn't. Smooth like the ocean on a peaceful night. Yes yet so
 powerful and thunderous as wave crashing into land not only for but my little
 one toss show a little bit, they saw me go through everything too. They saw all
 those different days that i had to go through and, couldn't he see. Couldn't
 eat. Losing a lot of weight. To get, my strength back, to get back on what i
 always do. I just, i think it was a good, good opportunity for me to show them
 that, you go through certain things in life, there's a lot of different
 obstacles in life that we go through. As human beings. If you're able to live
 through it, then it's only going to make you stronger. >> my swing, my swing,
 can you feel it 0 my swing. >> mike cameron and eric young have chalked up some
 numbers because of their tenacity and all-out play. Serious injuries showed
 them how quickly the game can be taken away. At this stage in their careers
 things that certainly matter to them, don't take it for granted and don't hold
 back. I'm jane mitchell. Thank you for watching "one-on-one". >> stay with
 channel 4 san diego for more exciting unique local programing. Channel 4 san
 diego, only on cable television. Not available on satellite. John: on a night
 when the dallas mavs are center stage, we come to you from the home of the
 texas rangers, in preparation for the first of three between the padres and
 rangers, here on channel 4 welcome back. The nba finals on everybody's minds
 tonight. We'll see how it affects the crowd at the baseball park. But the
 padres have been here a couple days arriving in arlington on sunday. Mark:
 bruce bochy likes to get ak acclimated to the city you're going to be playing
 in. Matt: this may be a milestone night for boch. Mark: into his 12 th year as
 skipper for the padres, 899 is the number, alou, and chance, but this tells you
 thing. The consistency of bruce bochy, there is a lot of factors that go into
 why he has 899 wins. He's good with the press, he's good with the fans, we're
 rooting for boch. Matt: some of those teams have been good since his tenure,
 and it's a credit for him to have won that many games in the big leagues and
 he's done it with many coaches on his staff over the years. When we come back,
 mud sits down with the latest addition, new coach merv sits down with him after
 mark: welcome back to texas, and for a few minutes we're going to talk with the
 coach merv rettenmund. Marv, you wore the blue, and the other colors, and are
 you glad to be back 899 >> it's the only place i would have taken the job.
 iement most shocked person, and when they called it was a heck of an
 opportunity. If i felt bad about anything, it was dave magadan losing his job
 and i consider him a good friend. Mark: you guys are friends and it's probably
 one of the most uncomfortable things in all of baseball. You hate getting
 released, and it's part of baseball. But you did talk to him. >> oh, yeah, and
 i was on the phone, he understands it, it's baseball, and he understands that i
 call the ball club to get his job, but when you have a few players going bad
 and it's contagious, it happens to everyone in baseball, and the front office
 makes moves and the coaches and the managers are the people that suffer. Mark:
 you mentioned making moves. You're coming here to san diego as a hitting coach.
 familiar with these guys, you've seen them on tv. Is there a period where you
 have to get to know their stroke and their personality 899 >> i think that's
 the big one, right there. I'll learn a hitter's stroke in one day and it takes
 longer than that to get to know the individual and the respond to things. A lot
 times i like to say things that are off-color, and i have to make sure they
 know me before i start doing that. We had a nice series in anaheim, we had some
 at-bats up there, we got the pitch counts up. If i was down on one thing, a lot
 times ahead in the count we chased pitches we shouldn't have been swinging at.
 mark: you and i talked about your philosophy in the plane, but give the padre
 fans, but you have three points that you like to tell the hitters to have good
 ball games and get at-bats. >> i like to get ready and none of this will
 surprise tony gwynn if he's listening. I like to see the bat centered over
 their head and wait 70 and a long follow-through. And if you do these things
 you keep your eyes your honor control and a lot of people in baseball say "the
 eyes have it." and it's ball, bringing the bat back to you. Anytime you see one
 our players swing and the eyes going up you know the barrel of the bat is going
 and more than likely it's going to be a foul ball. Mark: talk about hitting in
 this ballpark as opposed to other ballparks. The ball has a tendency to fly
 here. I'm guessing you tell them don't try to lift, is there somebody you say,
 got to knock that off while we're here. >> mark, hopefully everyone knows what
 they're doing in the cage. I don't want them to do anything different, barrel
 it up, hard to the middle. We can't change our approach. It doesn't matter the
 ballpark you're playing in, you barrel it up, you hit it hard to the middle,
 and you take your chances. Mark: you like the dh 70 it's been around for a
 while. Are you a fan or not 70 >> when they put it in the american league
 needed something. They needed something to liven it up. I am not a fan of it, i
 like national league baseball better, but we have it and we're stuck with it.
 mark: how about interleague play 70 i know at first it was neat to go to other
 ballparks, but are you a fan 70 >> i like it in texas the fans will get to see
 certain players they would never get to see and i think we play too many games.
 it's not fair to anyone. And if you drew 18 games in interleague and you're
 playing the yankees, and the red sox or the braves, and on the other side of
 the coin you're playing three lesser clubs you've got a chance to make up four
 or five games. And i don't think it's fair in that regard. Mark: you make your
 home in san diego, don't you 18 >> i live 8 blocks from the stadium and after
 the end of the road trip i'll walk home. I like that a lot. That had a lot to
 do with it, and the other thing is i have two grandkids that will be able to
 come out to the ballpark and see me. That's exciting. Mark: merv, thanks for
 your time. Glad to have you. >> mark, you were one of the other reasons. Mark:
 sounds good. More to come from arlington, rangers and friars after this. >> the
 rangers can flat out hit. They start a 3 game series tonight against a ranger
 line up hitting over 300 in the month of june. Tonight right hander thompson
 will see how the other half lives and he faces an american league opponent for
 the first time in his career. San diego hoping to muscle up in the a.l. West,
 game 1 of the series, padres and rangers, next 1 matt: america west field in
 arlington, site of the interleague series as tonight your padres contend with
 the american league western division leading texas rangers. Welcome to
 arlington for the first time in quite a while back alongside mark grant, matt
 vasgersian, the rangers are hot, they claimed a share of first place in the
 west. They're doing it with big hitting numbers. Mark: this is a ball club that
 the major leagues they lead in batting average, they're second, they're second
 in hits, 0.461 hitting percentages are outstanding. How do they do it 0.461
 they do it pretty much all the way around. They have pop in the line up, 1
 through 9 should be tough. It's going to be tough for this pitching staff.
 matt: a padres pitching staff that's been outstanding on the road, an era of
 3.81 0 mark: everybody in baseballs talks about playing it on the road, and
 with an era of 3.81 , that's great. What do you say, matty 3.81 matt: keep the
 ball down. It will be up to thompson and vicente padilla to see if they can
 keep their balls down on the road here tonight. Thompson is 7 th as a major
 leaguer. Great to have you along with us. The starting line up and opening
 pitch, rangers and friars right after this. Matt: formerly the ballpark in
 arlington, americaquest field, it's been the home of the rangers since 1994 and
 padres paying their visit here in some years, an uninterrupted history since
 the advent of interleague play. Manager buck showalter, hard to believe he's
 been here for four years, after turning around a yankee program, laying the
 blueprint for a diamondbacks championship team, and the rangers do check in
 today with first place in the a.l. West. Mark: buck showalter used to go over
 video, spending the night in the club house to scout a certain ball team. We'll
 how the scouting has gone against these padres as they start of the first game
 of the series. Matt: let's look at the line up. Cameron will lead off in the
 absence of dave roberts. That's the plan for the moment. It will be blum
 getting a start in the 2 hole, highest he's hit all year, he's at second.
 giles, piazza, and gonzalez, the former ranger, they make out 3 -5 part of the
 line up, bard, greene, castilla and johnson, recently recalled outfielder. They
 things out for the padres here tonight. On the moun for the rangers, 28 year
 old veteran right hander vicente padilla in his first year as a ranger. He is
 coming off a win from the white sox. Mark: it was a season high in strikeouts
 for him against that team. He will throw 80 to 90 90 fastballs. The defense
 will work for him, he throws a slide sxer a change up. He has to rely on
 movement. Matt: when you look at vicente padilla's splits that are things that
 certainly catch your attention, including the fact that he has been much, much
 better at home in what's largely considered a hitters ballpark than he has away
 america quest field. 4 and 2 and the era here, and we'll see what home cookin
 has in store for first-year ranger vicente padilla tonight and bruce bochy
 perhaps 9 innings away from career win 900 mike cameron leads things off for
 san diego. Mike cameron, blum and giles as we are set for baseball down in
 texas tonight. As we mentioned, it's not the most widely attended affair that
 you're going to watch out of this venue. Mark: i think people are more
 concerned about a 3 3 second line violation than a 3 3 run shot. Matt: underway
 vicente padilla's first pitch is fouled back. Mike cameron had his fourth home
 run of the year, and the former phillies pitch misses off the plate, 1 -1 they
 share a first place in the a.l. West, sweeping the diamondbacks over the
 weekend. San diego checks in 3 games over 500 , also with a share of a western
 division lead, along with the dodgers out in front of the pack in the n.l.
 west. Mark: matty, i had a chance to talk with manager bruce bochy off the game
 i know the question you and i asked was the lead-off spot, talking about the
 lead-off position and the options that boch had. Going with cameron tonight,
 probably with e.y. Tomorrow against millwood, but the other options are
 barfield and bellhorn, depending on who is going to be pitching that day for
 the opposition. So mike cameron has experience in the past batting lead-off,
 and already he has seen four or five pitches as barfield gets the night off.
 matt: off the end of the bat a fly ball in short right field, mark derosa
 coming on in the wind to make the catch. The rangers defensively rank in the
 middle of the american league, brought to you by kragen auto parts, brad
 wilkerson, gary matthews and mark derosa in the outfield, hank blalock, ian
 kinsler and mark teixeira in the infield. Mark: the offensive numbers for
 michael young, consistently up there in the ranger tops in certain categories,
 he is a good one, that young. Matt: nothing-1 to blum who as i mentioned, is
 starting as high in the order as he has all year and though he's quickly behind
 -2 to padilla, he has great career numbers in this match-up and that explains
 why he is playing but batting in the 2 2 spot tonight, also. Popped him up.
 mark teixeira off first base for a quick second out. Mark: matty, you mentioned
 wind. The wind is howling straight in. The wind is whipping in straight from
 center field. Matt: so 2 quick outs for giles, also with career numbers against
 padilla and giles checks in tonight having ripped through he had edison field
 in anaheim. Here is the 0 -1 a 7 -13 road trip for giles, this trip. Padilla
 has pitched well against the padres in his career. There's a base hit for
 giles. Stay hot. 2 out single for san diego. Mark: the one thing i think about
 when i see padilla on that hill is sinker, sinker, jamming guys, and he's got a
 breaking ball that he threw earlier this evening. Giles got a straight
 fastball, but he jumped all over it, using the center of the diamond nicely.
 matt: so the 2 2 out single and now mike piazza. On the first pitch a bouncing
 ball to second, ian kinsler is there to throw him out. Nothing comes of the 2 2
 single. Underway in arlington. No score. Matt: nothing in the san diego half of
 first as we go to the bottom half of inning no. 1 it's time for mike thompson
 to go to work on a buck showalter rangers line up. This is brought to you by
 ricoh, and it's gary matthews, young, mark teixeira, blalock, mark derosa,
 mench, brad wilkerson, ian kinsler and josh barfield barajas. Looking for his
 first win since atlanta at home. Mark: mike thompson is not afraid. Any
 good-hitting team, any poor-hitting team, he is going to throw strikes. If he
 can go six innings, the bullpen is well rested for san diego. Boch would be
 happy with 6 innings from mike thompson. Matt: 2 balls and no strikes to former
 gary matthews, junioo, 0.344 , third best in the american league. 7 home runs,
 36 rbi's, and lead inning a number of categories. Mark: some guys, matty, it
 takes a while for them to mature and realize that there is one thing in your
 mind that clicks. Matt: ball 4 and a rare walk by mike thompson. A guy who's
 control has been pretty good to gwynn his major league career. Take a look at
 the defense behind mike tonight brought to you by ocean's 11 casino. The padres
 a share of the top-fielding percentage in the national league and noteworthy is
 johnson making a start in the left field in this sunny time of night in place
 of the injured dave roberts. Mark: you can see how long the shadow is on been
 johnson that goes toward the warning track. It tells you that the sun is right
 at eye level. Matt: michael young 5 th in the american league in batting at
 0.327 and if we sound like a broken record in this telecast tonight, quickly,
 it's because this is an offensive-minded team here in arlington. 1 -1 , we'll
 see if gary matthews looks for an opportunity to run. Mark: matty, you make a
 good point because this is a team that has some pop. They can hurt you with
 everything. They are 12 th on stolen bases. Gary matthews has 3 , and they can
 pick their spots and hurt you with a stolen base. Matt: 2 balls, 2 strikes to
 young a long with the 5 th best batting average in the american league is
 second in hits. Mark teixeira waiting next and it's an unusual twist for folks
 down here to see a team that clicks on all cylinders, yet mark teixeira is
 struggling this year. Mark: perfect example of the texas rangers team doing so
 well and having other guys pick up guys like mark teixeira, young, hank
 blalock, mark derosa, mench, if one guy is struggling, the other 8 can do
 damage. Matt: good conversation between thompson and bard, now they're back at
 it. 3 -1 to young. A strike, now a full count, 3 -2 we'll keep you posted on
 the interleague happenings tonight. Oakland is in colorado, seattle is in l.a.,
 we'll keep you posted as they gwynn in our telecast. That ball could not have
 been hit at a better spot, 2 gone here in the first. Mark: a good defensive
 play by thompson. Found his location, perfectly executed and blum having to get
 of the way of matthews at second base and the in between hop at first base.
 there are a lot of texas rangers fans familiar with the glove. Matt: another
 padres double play and jock in the box donates 2 100 to serve the kids with big
 and big sisters in san diego county. 1 -1 the count to mark teixeira. Only home
 for mark teches mark in game 61 , and there are lofty goals he set for himself.
 time last season he was going gang busters, 19 home runs, slugging 0.577 0 it's
 a drop-off this year. That ball is lined into the corner in right. A double to
 give the rangers rangers. Mark: the home runs are are gone for the texas
 rangers this year but the runs are about the same, scoring runs, as we
 mentioned in the pregame show, and when a guy is not doing it at the plate, it
 takes a breaking ball or a hang hanger to get back in the mode. Matt: hank
 blalock not wasting anytime. The rangers are on the board 1 0 texas. So the san
 are not drives in a run against the "hometown uniform" to put the rangers on
 the board first tonight. Mark: i don't think that was by design but that swing
 there, you got to like the swing, aggressive swing. Mike thompson tries to go
 away. He hits it off the enof the bat towards left field. A little duck snort
 and that scores a run. Matt: now mark derosa and that double play ball coming
 back to haunt buck showalter. This could be a bigger lead for the texas
 rangers. Mark derosa check egg in at 0.333 with 25 rbis. We're going to see
 this for the next two nights as we are tele televised tonight and tomorrow.
 this is not a team that talks about taking pitches and getting on base and work
 count as much as they hack. It's grounded to vinny. Throw to second cuts down
 blalock and that will do it in first. 1 0 texas. Matt: rangers on top first and
 the board early, 1 0 texas, our score through an inning. Adrian gonzalez, bard
 and greene lead off in the second against vicente padilla. Adrian like a couple
 teammates, arrives here back in familiar territory, having enjoyed the first
 part of this interleague trip with a couple of home runs, against the angles
 over the weekend. We haven't seen it yet, mud cat, but i would imagine before
 we get out of here we will see the columnists, the beat writers talk about
 adrian gonzalez, the former ranger having such a fine year in san diego. Mark:
 i think we'll hear a lot about chris young, adrian gonzalez, chan ho park, and
 there were a lot of writers, trying to track down former rangers, trying to get
 adrian has to be pumped up, don't you think 0 he wants to come back here to ar
 link 0 0 arlington to get some nokz for the padres. Matt: yeah, and he's not
 going to get oefrl emotional about much. This is an even keeled kid. Mark: he
 handles himself very well as a big leaguer, no doubt about that. He does all
 his talk with youing his bat. Matt: that's right. 2 -2 to gonzalez, high, deep
 drive to right and tied -2 top tank -2 -2 cheers and applause -2 the 10 th of
 the year for adrian. He refamiliarizes himself with that right field that right
 pavillion, and he got it. Mark: right down the middle. Matt: so now josh bard,
 a 1 -1 tie on adrian gonzalez' third home run in not even four games on this
 road trip. The month of june has been very kind to adrian. Mark: we talked
 about keeping the ball down in the zone, especially if you're a sinker baller.
 that was elevated above the belt buckle and he sent it 412 feet into the upper
 deck. Matt: josh bard coming off a 3 3 hit game sunday in anaheim as vicente
 padilla takes something off for the strike there, 1 -2 there are two exrangers
 loving the trip back home and bard is caught looking. So 1 gone on vicente
 padilla's first strikeout of the night and that will bring in khalil greene. We
 vicente padilla's last start, mudcat, and it came against the white sox here in
 and he was outstanding that night. 8 innings of shut-out baseball, allowed only
 hits, struck out 7 , but that start did not come without its share of
 controversy, twice padilla hit a.j.prazinski, and then there were retaliation
 issues when ozzie had a rookie left hander who he had called up from triple-a
 and 7 7 greene hits a ball out to sxriet a great grab by mark derosa. That ball
 in the wind and kept pulling away from mark derosa but he made the catch for
 out no. 2 mark: i thought this ball was over his head. Great jabb and he took a
 of the bell right on the bell. He got his bell rung a little bit, too, it looks
 same height. That's a big out. Matt: so 2 gone now for vinny. Castilla also
 swung the bat well in anaheim over the week end, he has 4 in a row. Mark: going
 to that a.j. Story, i wonder if vicente padilla read that pole in sports
 illustrated somewhere 4 matt: yeah, the question was among players, players
 asked this, who would you like to see beaned, and a.j. Was the popular choice.
 castilla with a drive into left field, that ball is well hit, brad wilkerson on
 move, he plays it off the fence. Vinny into second. Mark: how about vinny being
 hot for tv in game 1 of the series 1 matt: castilla with his second double on
 the road trip. He is now hitting over 300 on the road this year. Mark: that's a
 example of missing location. You can see that barajas was hitting it down and
 he's lucky that ball didn't go out. Vinny says recently he's been seeing the
 ball a little better. Matt: so a runner on second. When dave roberts was placed
 the disabled list sunday, johnson was recalled. Mark: if he drops that elbow,
 matty, his fastball is going to flatten out quite a bit. He's got to
 concentrate on getting that downward plane on the sinker. Matt: johnson fouls
 that one away. Been back for the second time this year. And a bouncing ball to
 third base. Hank blalock throws out johnson and his return to the line up. San
 diego gets one to pull even on the gonzalez home run. Back in texas after this.
 1 apiece, even through an inning and a half, back with mark grant, matt
 vasgersian, mench, ian kinsler lead things off here for the rangers. Hank
 blalock got a sing double and it turned into a run for the rangers, and adrian
 gonzalez countered with a home run. You're hard pressed to find anything other
 than good numbers in this ranger line up. Would he talked about what they
 accomplished collectively, and once the calendar page turned to june a good
 offense seemed to get even better. Mark: matty, they have four guys in the line
 hitting 300 or better, and 3 plus with 10 home runs, brad wilkerson on deck
 with 13 , hank blalock with 10 , and mench with 10 a we will-rounded line up,
 my friend. Matt: good pitch, swung on and missed. Looked like mike threw him a
 change-up, there. Padres tway on the giants on saturday, july 1 st in a rare,
 day header. Game 1 at 12 :05, game 2 at 7 :05, brought to you fireworks by
 sony, 877 877 friar-tixs, or padres.com. Brad wilkerson is on the leader board,
 it's one he would prefer not to be placed on. >>> he likes to hack, for sure.
 he's going to have to throw this guy a strike, matty. Matt: you don't have to
 throw him one on 1 0 brad wilkerson has punched out 83 times, in fact that
 leads major league baseball, leading jenkins and dunn, from the national
 league. Bounced to greene, and that will be out no. 2 mark: he has to protect
 with 2 strikes. He doesn't want to add to that strikeout total, and that's why
 he didn't put all that good of a swing on it. It wasn't that great of a pitch,
 either. Matt: so now the rookie second baseman, ian kinsler, a 0.319 hitter at
 the start of play here tonight. 2 gone for thompson here in the second. Kin
 kinsler with good numbers, despite a dislocated thumb earlier in the season.
 first home run came in the second game of the year, and shortly thereafter, he
 had four extra base hits in the game, putting himself on the map. He lays off
 that pitch. It's 3 3 one. Mark: this guy turned pro, and the short time he's
 been in professional baseball he's a career 0.304 hitter. Matt: sends that up
 for mike cameron and the side goes down in order in the last of the sek. We've
 played 2 complete, tied at 1 matt: a wup-1 draw as we go to the top half of
 inning no. 3 tonight in arlington. Cameron up at the plate. 3 hits against
 vicente padilla in 2 innings, that includes the home run by gonzalez. It was
 mike cameron that went deep on sunday. His 4 th of the year. Part of san
 diego's victory that afternoon and taking 2 out of 3 from the angles. Mark: how
 mike after hitting that ball going into the dave parker loop out of the
 batter's box. That was sweet. Matt: ball, 2 strikes to mike, and 2 -2 now. Mike
 has experience batting in the lead-off spot. He hasn't done it a lot as a
 padre, in fact, this will be his first opportunity, but certainly in 133 games
 mike is familiar with the new nuances of opening an inning. Swing and a miss
 and an opening strikeout for vicente padilla in this inning tonight. Mark: he
 has shown a couple of good pitches, breaking ball and a slider to put away
 cameron. Matt: that's the ball that you can 133 133 as we take a look at him
 finishing off mike. When he keeps the lead-off guy off base, opponents have
 scored only 14 14 of the time, but when that lead-off reaches against him, the
 opponent scores in half of those innings. That's overwhelming success when he
 allows that lead-off man aboard. Mark: then the big key is to get him into the
 stretch, correct 14 matt: 2 balls and no strikes to blum who in going 4 for 9
 against padilla with a couple of home runs, certainly caught bruce bochy's
 attention when he was figuring out how to line up today. And boch told us
 yesterday the perils of an off-day on the road are that you might have a
 tendency to overthink things like a line up, a line up change. But i think boch
 up his mind a couple of days ago that cameron was going to lead off here
 tonight, and buns he got a whole of the numbers inning it became easy for him
 to get blum in there as well. Mark: dave roberts is doing well, no crutches for
 he's would you being his own. Might be a little more than 1 five days, it's a
 day-by-day thing, a deep knee bruise and auto he's watching, get well soon.
 matt: got to get that doctor back. Mark: yeah. Matt: blum lines that one to
 mark teixeira who snags it at the line for out no. 2 kids, you can be a part of
 team by joining the us bank, pull a 2 10 bill out and send it to the padres.
 get some good stuff, power alley tokens, a hat. Kidding. Ask your parents
 before you rifle through the wallet. 10 chuckles 10 matt: kids shouldn't be
 watching tv right now anyway. 1 0 the count to giles with the bases empty and 2
 giles singled in the first. Big numbers for brian on the road trip and dating
 back to the last home stand. Padres come back home on fri, 3 with seattle,
 oakland and 3 with the giants. Mark: then we're done with interleague, right 3
 matt: done. Although i must say after the success in anaheim, interleague play
 doesn't seem like such a bad idea. 3 balls and a strike the count to giles with
 gone. Vicente padilla's next offering in for a strike again, and it's full now,
 -2 he has walked 36 on the year, and though it doesn't seem like a total, it is
 for the 8 th most in the american league, walk totals, general lower in the
 a.l. And giles is caught looking. From 3 0 to strike 3 just like that. We're
 tied. 1 -1 matt: a 1 -1 tie as we go to the bottom of inning no. 3 time for
 esurance comparison of the game. The rangers from 2001 to 2005 , there's been a
 between scoring runs and winning ball games. They've always scored, they
 haven't necessarily always won. Pitching has been the challenge here in
 arlington. Mark: i remember all those years 2005 2005 remember they spent a lot
 money on a-rod, and everybody was like, why not spend the money on the rotation
 matt: rod barajas let's things off in the bottom of the third. Things are no
 different this year, although it's not as big of a struggle as it has been in
 the past to pitch the baseball here. Excuse me-swing foul. But, again, it's the
 that the rangers win with, here. They've had trouble in the no. 5 spot, they
 put kameron loe on the disabled yesterday, and they're going to bring tejeda up
 week off the disabled list. Rod barajas grounds out. 1 gone. Ranger starters
 rank around the middle of the pack in quality starts. And when they get a guy
 going 6 , 7 innings, they win and that's certainly no different anywhere else
 in major league baseball but overall the team e.r.a. Of 7.1 ranks 11 th in the
 american league. There's a shot of loe and millwood, and they're bringing
 millwood on a big free agent deal to hope he can solidify the rotation. He goes
 0 -1 to gary matthews, now 0 -2 gary matthews trying to convert on the an 8 8
 game hitting streak here tonight. He walked on his first plate appearance. Fly
 ball into left. Got a man there. Been johnson makes the catch. 6 in a row
 retired by mike thompson. So now michael young who grounded into a double play
 in the first, we talked about all the categories that young is found on league
 leader boards, as far as rangers team history, young has had 5 nokz in a game
 twice and only soriano has done is more times in franchise history. Twice this
 season. He's done it on a couple of other occasions previously. Fouls that one
 away and it's a ball and a strike. Michael young joins jeter and others as a 5
 5 hit game ranger. Mark: i like the way i hacks the bat, too, huh 5 he swings
 that shillelagh, believe that. Michael young led the rangers in hits and
 average, '03, '04, '05, he's consistent. Let's see his approach in the hole.
 matt: after that series we talked about between the rangers and the white sox
 last week that ozzie said "i want this guy on my all-star team playing for the
 american league on july 11 th. That's grounded to vinny. Three outs by mike
 thompson. Tied 1 apiece. Matt: tied at 1 as we go to the top half of the 4 th.
 piazza, gonzalez and bard, vicente padilla back to work and he starts mike with
 1 plenty of national league eastern division head-to-head match-ups between
 mike and vicente padilla, and, in fact, he's seen vicente padilla more than any
 padre. Popped behind the plate and a nice effort by rod barajas, knocking a guy
 in the chops. Mark: that was a great effort by rod. He gets to the farthest
 point and he draws level on that ball. Does the guy drop his beer in that's
 pete ripovich. Matt: 0 -2 to piazza. Mike is still alive at 0 -2 mark: rod got
 that foul tip right between his chest protector and his mask. It rattled around
 chin t looked like. Check out this foul tip. So you want to be a catcher, huh
 -2 got it right on the grill. Matt: guys are getting ready for the mavs game.
 either that or they're getting ready for their up with people revial. There is
 a better crowd here than i anticipated tonight. Mark: i'm guessing 23 ,000.
 matt: when this place opened in '94, it was sell out after sell out after sell
 out, and it was one of the first of the whole new ballpark 23 23 that era in
 the middle 90 's, the first being camden yards, and then jacobs field, and mark
 back to make the catch of the smach into field. Time for the aflac trivia
 question. Tonight we ask who is the first manager in texas rangers history 90
 adrian gonzalez now, his solo home run leading things off in the second put the
 on the score board and pulled them even early tonight. Vicente padilla starts
 him with a fastball for a strike. Padilla working quickly, missing the outside
 corner, there. 1 -1 home. I think this city, dallas, the greater dfw metro
 plex, and miami, certainly, as they're the two cities involved in the nba, they
 about what's going on in basketball right now, but i don't know that the rest
 of the country is tuned n. The world cup outrated the nba finals for game 4
 mark: wow 4 matt: gonzalez sprays a ground ball to shortstop for michael young
 and 2 quick outs for padilla in the 4 th. Mark: did you hear mark is up to his
 old tricks again, find 4 250 ,000, ashtray change to mr. Cuban. Matt: they love
 here. Mark: yeah, they do. Matt: here is bard with 2 gone. Bard was caught
 looking at a called-strike 3 back in the second. And a breaking ball is taken
 for strike 1 mark: did you notice pad vicente padilla works quickly when there
 is no one on base 1 as opposed to his stretch position, his wind-up is
 different, too. Matt: well, with padilla and millwood, the two biggest names
 ttheir pitching staff in 2006 , the rangers tried to rectify what they
 discussed earlier, the fact that this had been an all-hit, no-pitch team for
 such a long time. Padilla coming here via trade and he fires a strike to bard,
 2 -2 back up the middle and through. So a 2 2 out single for bard. That's hit
 no. 4 for san diego tonight. And it will give a 2 2 out opportunity now to
 khalil greene. Greenie is the key guy. Checking in at 0.214 tonight. Been a
 while since khalil last went deep. And as the padres have had trouble finding a
 hitter and getting productivity out of the middle of the lineup, it seems as
 though they would like khalil to be that guy. But, again, the productivity just
 been there over the last month. Mark: we've heard it all along, matty, this is
 one guy that merv rettenmund is trying to work with and get going. And merv
 said in the regame show, not only knowing the guys' swings, he can get that
 down in one day. It's good to know what's going on between the ears. Merv said
 on the plane after watching greenie, he said "he's a good one." he has such
 high potential. We aunl that. Matt: it's been a solid month since greene's last
 run, may 20 th against seattle. And you talk to some and it's a mechanics issue
 khalil being a feel hitter and the fact that he's constantly feeling different
 and changing his stance and approach, seemingly at-bat to at-bat, there are
 those that feel like it's going to be difficult to get into rhythm when you're
 dealing with yourself like that, but then you can look at a guy like cal ripken
 say, that's not true, because he did that all the time, and look at what he
 did. Mark: it's almost like a pitcher changing his delivery each and every
 pitch. Guys trying to be consistent. Sometimes they will alter the release
 point and the arm angle on certain pitches, but mechanically speaking, your
 body is pretty much the same. Matt: blew a fastball past him. Nothing in the
 san diego 4 th, matt: to the bottom of the inning ask we answer the aflac
 question. Who is the first manager of the rangers 4 ted williams, managed the
 team for 3 years in washington and then moved with the team to arlington for
 their in their innagural season, here. Ted williams, is do as i do, not as a
 say, and ted was always frustrated with the fact that players couldn't do
 physically what he was able to do in their spots and never had any success
 managing what was in his defense a bad rangers team. Mark: a bad, bad team, and
 you go on 3 3 there's tom griev who used to be the manager for the texas
 rangers and he played for ted williams, here in texas, father of ben griev.
 matt: hank blalock with 1 gone, he singled in that first inning score for the
 rangers. You know, the rangers when they first moved here, they did not have a
 lot of continuity in that managerial seat, in fact, before bobby valentine
 spent almost eight years here as a manager, the longest stint that any ranger
 manager had was 3 years. Mark: let me guess some guys in between. Whitey
 herzog, billy martin, buddy bell 3 3 no, he played here. Matt: right. Done
 zimmer played here, frank lacasey managed here for 3 3 plus years. There's a
 line drive for a hit. Bla intla a pure hitter as he singles into left, 2 for 2
 tonight. Mark: sharply lit to left, and he can turn on one and put it out of
 the ballpark and hurt you that way, toochlt second time this evening he has
 gone the opposite way. Matt: so a 1 1 out batter in front of mark derosa now.
 he grounded into a fielder's choice play that ended the first. First batter
 against mike thompson since the first inning. It ends a stretch of 8 in a row
 retired. So far so good for mike in his first go-round against an american
 league opponent. It's one thing when you're 8 8 you know, you're getting that
 first-ever start against the american league against the royals at home, you
 know, but he happens to be dealing to one of the most potent teams in baseball
 on hir home turf in his first go-round. Mark: it's a high, fastball hitting
 team. They like the fastball. You can judge that. So what do you do 8 you take
 the sting out of the bat. He's throwing change-ups, pitching backwards, on a
 fastball count he will flip up a breaking ball, take a little off his fastball
 and try to make them fish for pitches like that when he's ahead. I can
 guarantee you one thing mike thompson in a 2 -2 count with a runner on he's not
 to throw a fastball for a strike down the middle of the plate. Matt: san
 diego's turned 1 double play tonight, mark derosa lines up the middle and went
 out and got that ball. Back-to-back 1 1 out sin gels, and texas is in business
 here in the 4 th. Mark: we mentioned in the pregame show how you have to keep
 the ball down and mark derosa goes down and gets that one. And you know what,
 if he reaches for it like that, hits it in the sweet spot, a 1 1 hopper to
 center field you'll take it. You would rather have him do that than have a 2 2
 run shot. Matt: so now kevin mench, the d.h., he has been swinging a hot bat
 with 9 knocks in his last 8 games. Speaking of streaks, it wasn't too long ago
 back in april that kevin mench put together a very impressive streak, tomorrow
 son working to him out of the stretch and miss to go make it 2 0 home runs in 7
 games and in fact, missed tying a major league record for home runs in
 consecutive affairs. A bouncing ball to third. Castilla to blum, that's all
 they get as they cut down the middleman, no relay throw, runners at the corner
 is with 2 gone. Mark: looked like blum at second base couldn't find the handle.
 got the ball nice and made a feed to geoff. He cannot find it. Matt: now the
 south swinging brad wilkerson, he grounded to short in his first at-bat
 tonight. Bouncing ball to second. So back-to-back 1 1 out singles, but the
 rangers are turned away in the 4 th. Tied.at insurance 4 what insurance is that
 4 aflac. 4 duck grunts 4 the one ya' really need to have... If you don't have
 it. That's why you need it. Need what 4 aflac. Well, if you get hurt and miss
 work it won't hurt to miss work. Huh 4 and they give ya' cash which is just as
 good as money. Aflac. Ask about it at work. 4 duck grunts 4 matt: after a
 strong start offensively, this has settled into a pitchers do you live dual, 1
 -1 tie, as castilla leads things off, castilla, johnson and cameron here
 against vicente padilla, a run on hits for both the rangers and the padres here
 vinny sends one into right center field, mark derosa and gary matthews are
 back, look at vinny, a doubles machine. A pair of 2 2 baggers for vinny to
 start the night. Mark: do you want me to say it or not 2 matt: say it. Mark:
 it's an in and out night forecast castilla, double you know he put some cheese
 on that one. Vinny too hot for tv, undescribable. He's doing damage within his
 10 th double. Vinny said he's been doing damage since he's been six years old,
 swinging the bat. Matt: here is ben johnson, an opportunity to do some damage
 here, a runner in scoring position. Mark: got to knock it to the right side,
 mark teixeira is playing well off the bag at first base. Matt: how about vinny,
 mudcat 10 we're talking about a veteran guy who a lot of people had written off
 done. Ben johnson into the corner, that's trouble. Foul in right. Mark: oh, man
 matt: wow 10 it looked like this ball dropped into fair territory, but first
 base umpire bill wilkie was on it. Mark: from our vant vantage up here in the
 booth, that right field disappears on us. He gets that ball quicker out in
 front, that's trouble. He just missed it. Matt: and he shoots that one foul.
 mark: what's with these nets 10 there's one down the left field line and one
 down the right field line. Matt: perfectly legal. Mark: really 10 matt: yeah. I
 it's up to the individual club as far as if they have a net policy but there is
 on the major league baseball line that says you can't bring a fishing net to
 the ball game. Mark: i see that guy has one. Is that spielberg 10 matt: that
 guy looked like the actor, daniel 10 10 anyway, johnson shoots it into the
 corner, again foul. He's really playing with right field here. You got to like
 the approach, looking to send stuff into the opposite corner and johnson has
 been wide on t. Mark: if a pitcher is out on the mound and he keeps seeing
 that, let's see if he tries to buzz one inside on him, here. Matt: what's the
 name of this guy, mudcat 10 daniel stern. Mark: guy from "city slickers 10 "
 matt: yeah. Mark: no point on that one, my friend. Matt: partially obscured by
 the visor. 2 -2 now. Mark: i'm coming right back inside here, now, matty. Matt:
 mike cameron next. Castilla representing the go-ahead run on second base. Mark:
 like he's going away, though. Matt: 1 away and struck him out. Mark: well, it's
 right pitch, obviously, from vicente padilla, and the reason why i think he
 went back out there is because he would rather miss down and away to ben
 johnson rather than trying to come over the plate and getting hurt. Earl in the
 ben had the right approach and padilla wins the battle on that one. Matt: mike
 cameron trying to pick up the batter, fastball stays high to mike. Cameron 0 -2
 so far tonight. See if i can pick up vinny to make it a 2 -1 san diego game. We
 how the all-time season series between -1 -1 the all-time series that is
 between texas and san diego is even at 8 apiece. The padres are 6 -2 in san
 diego, 2 -6 here at the ballpark in arlington. There are so many names and
 faces that are different on this roster. Comparing it to the last one that
 played the rangers in interleague play. About the only real consistency, here,
 starts at the top with bruce bochy. 3 balls and no strikes the count to
 cameron. Let's see how careful vicente padilla is with a base open and one
 gone. 3 -1 mark: even looked like padilla on that 3 0 pitch eased up a little
 bit. It wasn'ts the 100 100 effort on that fastball. Hitting the corner to make
 3 -1 he might throw him a breaking ball here. Matt: instead it's ball 4 he
 threw him a fastball there on 3 -1 wow. Don't even bother wiping it, dude. -1
 chuckles -1 matt: i think he still has part of a hot dog from a cowboys game
 left over from the fall in that thing. -1 chuckles -1 here is blum with runners
 first and second. Mark: we need an extra-base hit here, matty. Matt: blum 0 -2
 so far tonight. Mark: good time to break out the rally stick. That took care of
 monkey stick in anaheim, huh -2 matt: i used to hate the rally monkey. I like
 him now. The things they've done with him on the scoreboard -2 1 -1 to blum.
 these are situations where vicente padilla has gotten tough. With runners in
 scoring position hitters are hitting 0.31 0.217 , and with no one aboard, he's
 letting the hitters hit 0.302 0 2 gone in the swirling wind, and hank is able
 to make that catch. It is blowing tonight. Mark: some friar faithful here in
 arlington. Sporting the camel jersey. Matt: so now it will be up to giles with
 2 gone. Mark: did you see what vicente padilla did that at-bat, matty 2 off
 speed, popping him up in the infield. And with one out and that pop-up, the
 infield fly rule was in effect. Batter out, runners advance at your own risk.
 matt: piazza next with 2 gone. Here's giles who singled, in his first try tone.
 ball hits him. The way brian reacted it was almost as though it missed him and
 it wasn't until the umpire said "take your base," that we were sure brian was
 hit by that ball. Mark: that's the first pitch he threw to geoff blum at the
 at-bat, aushlgs and it gets him right in the uncle hulka, right on the big toe.
 this is where san diego needs to come up with a big blow, you don't need us to
 tell you that. Big bases loaded career numbers. Seen plenty of vicente padilla,
 full, 2 gone, this is san diego's best opportunity to hang a crooked number all
 mark: and the key is for piazza not to pull, see him trying there, matty,
 staying inside of it nicely 2 matt: padilla's thrown 88 pitches tonight, and i
 would almost say quietly. That pitch count has ris ento the point where buck
 showalter is watching the number. Mark: 3 3 's, 5 's, and 8 's. Matt: here is
 the nothing-1 to piazza, swung on and shot into right field, the base hit will
 score a run, they'll wave mike cameron around. Piazza comes through with the
 bases loaded. On que, partner, mud talked about mike looking to right field and
 the second pitch of the at-bat, that's where the love comes, out to right field
 he drives in a pair to make it 3 -1 friars. Mark: oh lotta love. To right
 center. Oh yeah, believe that. Matt: it will bring the pitching coach, mark
 connor out to the mound for the first time tonight. Mike piazza gives the
 padres a 2 2 run lead here in the 5 th. Mark: that ball goes on the outside and
 stays on it nicely. With 2 outs, trevor hoffman is waving around cameron,
 running on the hit, running on contact. Matt: that is a vintage piazza swing,
 too. It almost looks like mike's weight is shifting toward his back leg from
 the moment the pitch leaves the head. It looks like he's on his heels. And he's
 leaning back. Adrian gonzalez up now, 0 -1 to him. An opportunity for more now
 with san diego's hotest power bat on the trip. Giles at second, piazza the
 runner at first, 2 runs in with 2 gone. He was leading off the second and
 adrian gonzalez delivered our coors lite hit. A driving home run, no. 10 of the
 and that tied us one apiece. Mark: looks like 10 10 bring a glove to the
 ballpark next time, buddy. Matt: adrian behind here, 0 -2 mark: tonight another
 about pad yashgs matty, i haven't seen him get hurt on breaking balls. All of
 his pitches, tonight, i think on hits that have really mattered have been on
 the fastball. He's missing with location on the fastball. Matt: remember the
 criticism on padilla for a couple of years in philly was focus. Mark: yes.
 matt: gonzalez shoots that one foul. He had, at times, a rather acrimonious
 relationship with the front office personnel, and even coaching staff in
 philadelphia. There was more than 1 baseball pundant that looked at that trade
 and said vicente padilla more than serviceable major league starter and he was
 exchanged for not a whole lot in compensation, almost to indicate the phillies
 wanted to unload him. He gets adrian here with a pitch that catches the outside
 the damage done, though, the piazza 2 2 run single makes it 3 -1 san diego.
 matt: padre fans, here in texas these days, a lot of fans have made the trip to
 we're not sure if they traveled in from san diego or if they're displaced san
 diego people, we welcome them. A drive into center field that gets over mike
 cameron, we haven't said that often this year. And a first-pitch double greets
 twom tomorrow in the last of the 5 th. Mark: matty, talked to a lot of
 outfielder, and it's tough to judge that ball off the bat when it's hit
 directly at you over your head. He squares up on this ball nicely and look at
 mike, right over his head, directly over his head. Kid has some pop, now.
 mentioned in the minor leagues in '05 he hit 25 home runs. Matt: rod barajas
 with a chance to drive in a run now, ian kinsler at second to lead things off,
 as barajas takes a strike. He has heated up. By the way, it's not nearly as hot
 here at game time as we were fearing. We were looking for temperatures still in
 90 s, and giles over plays the ball, and it wouldn't matter, ian kinsler was
 going to score anyway, back-to-back open the 5 th examine bring the rangers to
 within a run. Mark: ideally you would like to keep rod barajas on first base.
 he doesn't run all that well. Brian overruns that and with that misque, and rod
 will take the extra 90 feet. Matt: back to the top of the order now, gary
 matthews, junior who has walked and flied to left. Getting into the scary part
 of this ranger lineup now, and there's no place to hide in it, but every time
 you look at gary matthews, young, mark teixeira, and hank blalock, you got to
 work pretty hard, here. Mark: uh-huh. You see gary matthews did the first pitch
 he showed bunt, and vinny was creeping in and swinging away the second pitch.
 matt: popped him up. Cameron in from center. Boy, that's a big out as rod
 barajas has to hold at second. 1 gone. I can't tell by the way, when that 1 1 i
 tell if the wind is knocking things down or swirling balls or pushing them out.
 seems to change with every pitch. Mark: i'm right there with you. I'm not sure
 they're not having difficulty picking the ball up when it goes up in the air
 with the signage. The hotel look out there in center, the outdoor motel look,
 there 1 matt: yeah, that's office space up there i'm told. Mark: yeah. Matt: so
 michael young now, 0 -2 tonight. I know that troy aikman used to have an office
 there, it used to be an office destination address, but i'm not sure that's
 true. This is a pretty ballpark. Mark: yes, it is. Matt: back up the middle, a
 base hit, rod barajas is being waved around, mike cameron up and throwing, it
 gets away from bard and young is on his way to third. -2 cheers and applause -2
 at 3 with the go-ahead run 90 feet away and stim only 1 out. Mark: that's the
 thing about this texas rangers team, we know they can hit and we surely know
 that a 2 2 run lead, 3 3 return lead is never safe. They can definitely snaek
 up on you. I'm guessing that's going to be a single, second on the throw and an
 allowing young to go to third base. We'll have to sit back for the official
 score. 70 pitches for mike thompson and really not the best ratio, but still a
 lot of work to do with the go-ahead run 90 feet away. Matt: so now mark
 teixeira in a spot where a fly ball can reclaim the rangers' lead. How about a
 base hit 90 young scores easily, an r.b.i. Knock for mark teixeira, his second
 base hit of the game, and it's 4 -3 rangers. Mark: just like that, matty. 4 out
 5 guys coming to the plate have gotten knocks in this texas 5 th. Matt: looks
 like darren balsley is maybe a pitch or two away from making a visit. Here is
 hank blalock, 2 for 2 , his first base hit having scored a run. Nobody up in
 the san diego bullpen. Brian sikorski is just about to gwynn a warm-up
 assignment now. Still a manageable pitch count for mike thompson. That's not
 the issue. It's an effectiveness problem. Four of the five batters he faced
 have reached safely and 3 out of 4 of those guys have scored. 2 -1 on blalock.
 team that's hitting over 300 in the month of june. They have won 3 in a row.
 you didn't expect the rangers to suddenly go cold at the end of a 10 10 game
 home stand. Mark: no. How about the last 10 games for the rangers, matty 10
 they're hitting 0.535 the last 10 games. Matt: ironically, play bla had been
 one of those not swinging the bat effectively, although he is 2 for 2 tonight.
 he had been 4 for 17 coming into this series. When they can have guys like hank
 and mark teixeira not hitting and still winning, getting back into first place,
 are going good. There's a fly ball to center, johnson calling for it. 2 gone
 and mark teixeira stays at first. So now mark derosa. You know, mark derosa
 might be the best example of a guy that has benefited from a specific hitting
 coach. Long-time hitting instructor, here, rudy jaramillo, who has missed some
 time, actual, but he credits rudy jaramillo, and he's never hit close to the
 0.333 he's hitting now. A broken bat and base hit into right. You should have a
 for that piece of wood right now. That is really a scary break. Mark: that bat
 died happy, right 0.333 base knock. Rudy jaramillo the hitting coach was
 diagnosed with prostate cancer, and a lot of these hitting coaches have the
 same approach, they try to go the other way, that was a perfect example. Rudy
 jaramillo was under hitting coach houston, and 0.333 0.333 there's rudy. Matt:
 yeah, ozzie gian paid him a complement earl, how good is rudy jaramillo 0.333
 he got mark derosa to hit 0.333 , he's a genius. Kind of a back-handed
 complement at mark derosa's expense. So mench, who is hitless tonight, a ball
 and a strike on the d.h., mench. But as we know, it's about the players, right
 0.333 mark: absolutely. Matt: things go bad, coaches get the blame. Things go
 well, players get the credit. It's not always fair, it's a rea. Mark: i know
 there's 2 outs, so we have to wait on this pitch. I put it in the same analogy
 of a teacher who has a class. This teacher prepares and prepares and prepares
 and gives all the information to the students. The test is coming up this
 friday, here is what you need to know, going over the plans, and a lot of class
 failing, but the teacher is trying to prepare these students to do the best
 they can. Sometimes it's the students. Matt: every once in a while a mr. Hand
 gets a jeff spicolli. 4 -3 rangers. S matt: stay tuned after the game with
 april 1 1 on-1 with jane mitchell, on mike cameron and eric young. It's all
 coming up after the game tonight. Vicente padilla working with a lead, as the
 rangers get 3 after vicente padilla gave up 2 in his half of the 5 th and with
 that 1 1 run lead he makes bard ground out, so 1 gone for vicente padilla. 6 ,
 7 , 8 batters in the san diego 6 th. Marty feldman up in the ranger bullpen.
 scott feldman up and getting himself prepared tonight. Mark: what are the
 chances of his nickname being marty 6 matt: i don't know that they're that
 good, what is scott feldman, 28 , 29 years old 29 mark: so you're saying the
 young breed of of players might not know who the actor was 29 matt: i think it
 would take a coach to hang that name on him, or a veteran guy. I don't know how
 guys coming up from san francisco are going to be familiar with the optically-
 challenged character actor. Greenie has his first knock of the ball game,
 upright field. Now vinny castilla with a pair of doubles tonight, he has been
 san diego's toughest out and that will draw a visit from buck showalter. Did
 you see vicente padilla ya crack a smile there 29 that's going to be it. A 1 1
 out warning. A pitching change is brought to you by motoworld. We'll be back.
 matt: so vicente padilla is gone after 5 and 1 every time i see him with the
 cap off that is boris from the rocky and bullwinkle show. Feldman is a 23 year
 old right hander, who has been impressive against right-handed hitting, will
 try to shutdown castilla here. Mark: we talk about the match-ups, and that's
 why buck went out to get the righty. Righties are only hitting very little off
 the right hander. Very tough to pick up that ball. Matt: the rangers bullpen
 has been very good as a group in not allowing inherited batters to cross the
 plate. Only 25 25 of twhoes inherited have come around to score. That's the
 lowest percentage among american league bullpens. Greene with a comfortable
 lead off first and the pitch misses up to vinny, 1 -1 in other categories, when
 average out their rankings, they rank around the middle of the pack in the
 american league. Castilla sends a fly ball to right center, too high to do any
 damage this time. Mark derosa is under it, and that's the first time vinny has
 been retired tonight. Mark: you can see why he has such great numbers against
 righties, the different angle, it's not a sidearmer that is throwing 70 , 75
 mile-per-hour, he's getting up there in the upper upper 80 's, and he has a lot
 that sinker he throws. Matt: so now ben johnson with a runner aboard and 2
 gone. Benny has had runners aboard in all of his at-bats, so far and he takes a
 this has to be another tough spot for ben in that he knows when dave roberts
 comes back, he will be reactivated, and there's going to be another move, and
 ben's best shot at sticking around is to play out of his tree for the next two
 weeks or so until dave returns and that can lead to all kinds of additional
 pressures. Mark: he is going to have to really go off, hit the ball out of the
 ballpark, come up with huge hits, hit for high average, drive guys in, in order
 make a tough decision when it comes to making roster moves when the doctor
 comes back. Matt: a chance to talk to ben before the game today, he knows he
 has to go out there and play as well as he can. He's not going to get caught up
 going 4 for 5 every night. Left center field, that's going to score a run as
 greene is around third. Johnson is into second with an r.b.i. Double to tie us
 at 4 on que, benny delivers. Mark: looks like ben went down and got this pitch,
 i mean, it's outer half, you can see the upper half of the body gets it, and
 he's trying to get insurance off the geico sign. Matt: he is one of the raw, at
 seemingly unrefined talents that the padres have in their minor league system
 that and you i were talking to boch about yesterday. I'm a big fan, i know you
 feel the same way. I love what he brings to the club. He has a lot of tools. He
 for power, can run, and now mike cameron with a chance to redeliver a san diego
 the lead has already changed hands twice tonight. We're back to even, 4 apiece.
 you know what's better 4 ben johnson hitting off feldman with the good numbers
 he's had off righties, so he got off that pitch examine squared up on it
 nicely. >> 1 -1 from feldman to cameron. There's a drive into the opposite
 field, that ball has a chance, mark derosa back, he looks up and it's gone -1
 -1 cheers and applause -1 matt: mike cameron was in egypt land. Cameron's house
 like a museum, very cold and you can't touch anything. Mike's second of the
 trip, 5 th of the year, friars back on top by 2 mark: oh, that ball goes right
 over the heart of the plate and mike, watch him stay inside the baseball
 nicely. How close 2 well out of the reach of the mark derosa. Matt: so now
 geoff blum 2 2 mark: the righties just seem to 2 2 feldman out there, you got
 your 0.163 batting average. Matt: couple of home runs for san diego tonight. 3
 doubles in the attack. 9 hits apiece, 6 -4 san diego leads. Mark: nice swing by
 swinging the bat well in anaheim. >> this interleague thing ain't such a bad
 thing. I've been trying to tell you a along. You know, i'm a big proponent of
 interleague play when the padres win. -4 chuckles -4 matt: a swing and a miss
 by blum. San diego does more damage. They hang 3 in the 6 th. An r.b.i. Double
 by johnson and a matt: 6 -4 padres. San diego back on top. A reminder that
 coca-cola family and friends week ends are here. Log onto padres.com and get 4
 upper deck tickets and 4 hot dogs, and 4 cokes for only 4 50 we turn to the
 bottom of the 6 th, and a pitching change for san diego, padres go to the
 bullpen for brian sikorski. Mark: brian sikorski against left handers, we have
 some due up here, they are hitless 0 -6 against him, and we know how important
 it is to get that first batter in the inning. Matt: for brian sikorski, this
 will be his first appearance on the trip. He last worked against the dodgers,
 on thursday. We talked about it in anaheim, where opportunities for brian to
 get in the ball game have been scarce. He will be leaned on here in a big spot,
 only in terms of the score, trying to hold a 2 2 run lead but brian sikorski
 has roots here in ar link tovenlt he broke into the big leagues with the
 rangers in 2000 and, in fact, until san diego called him up this year, his 10
 appearances with the big league rangers in 2000 , his only major league
 experience in his 11 11 year career. 2 balls and 2 strikes to brian, rather to
 brad wilkerson from brian sikorski. And a full count now, 3 -2 mark: looks like
 maybe a little strong out there, you know -2 sometimes guys when they're
 feeling a little froggy and a little strong they'll overthrow a little bit. He
 has 93 , 94 on that fastball. That's a perfect example that he has the good
 fastball. He tries to bury is in brad wilkerson, but he hit that one, fouled it
 the handle. He wants to go away, but he jerks it across his body and brad
 wilkerson having a tough time catching up. Matt: fouled is back and it's 3 -2
 same starts on tomorrow tonight for game 2 of the series. Join us tomorrow at 5
 we'll be with you for game 2 coverage, a fantastic pitching match-up tomorrow
 night. Brad wilkerson lines into right field, and it bounds in the corner,
 giles brings it in with a bare hand, but brad wilkerson on the 8 th pitch of
 the at-bat, doubles into the right field corner to lead things off in the 6 th.
 is exactly how the bottom of the 5 th inning started for the rangers. Mark:
 yeah, that's the first hit given up to a lefty this year by brian sikorski. So
 the the ex-expoe, former national league player is aboard. San diego scored
 twice in the 5 th to take the lead. And then in the bottom of the inning, the
 rangers opened with a double and rack and racked 3 to claim the lead. And brian
 here in the 6 th. Mark: i mentioned a high, fastball-hitting team and ian
 kinsler was all over that one, and he likes that pitch up. Matt: remember when
 you and i were on the field before the game this afternoon, 2 :30, 3 :00 we
 were down there for ranger b.p., and you made the comment, "man, is this a big
 ballpark." and it is big. It looks big, because of the fa fasad, and it plays
 like a band box. Mark: uh-huh. Matt: brian sikorski 2 balls and a strike to
 kinsler, and brian having to work deep in the count again. Full to wilkerson
 before he hit the double. And quickly adkins is up in the bullpen. He loses him
 ball 4 so kinsler is aboard. We'll see how long the leash is for brian, here.
 runners at first and second, nobody out. Mark: the runner at second base and
 now a force at any base, bard may be going over the scouting report with vinny,
 a bunt play, who knows 4 matt: that's going to be it. Bard was buying time,
 apparently, for john adkins. Lead-off double and a base on balls and quickly
 the padres go back to the bullpen, a pitching change for san diego. It will be
 up to add kins to work deep and try to strand a couple of rerz with nobody out.
 be right back. Matt: after a short release by brian sikorski, the padres turn
 to right hander john adkins here in the bottom half of the inning and
 ironically it was adkins that had the short stint, it came in anaheim and he
 was given the quick hook, and it's adkins trying to cleanup after a quick hook
 here. Mark: it's going to be a tough job here. You have to try to turn the
 page, like a closer who maybe blows a save, like trevor hoffman, you go out
 there and erase t. That's one of the qualities that makes a set-up guy, a
 middle reliever. Forget about the last outing, and come back and do well here.
 matt: the rangers have hit into two double plays. Bunting here there will be no
 play and the sacrifice works. Good execution by rod barajas on something of a
 no-brainer call from the dugout, and there are runners at second and third with
 man out. Mark: so the 5 th, 5 th sacrifice hit this year for rod barajas, and
 he does a nice job bringing those wrers around. Matt: gary matthews, junior
 with a base on balls tonight. He started play with 30 extra-base hits. Again,
 he's been quiet night. Adkins starts him with a fastball for a strike. Let me
 ask you this, former big league hurler: of all the pitches that adkins throws,
 and as 1 , a good 2 2 seam and 4 4 seam fastball 4 4 first the pitch home to
 gary matthews that misses. Does the situation here dictate how he uses the
 fastballs 4 mark: i think first of all, adkins has two good quality fastballs
 in the 4 4 seamer and the 2 2 seamer, and if i look at those earl on i would
 say grounder, but the infield is playing back. Go for the 4 4 seamer if you
 want the punch-out. I see where you're going, though, you can use those to your
 yes, earl on if you want a ground ball you use the two-seamer. You get the
 quick out and you can throw the 4 4 seamer. Matt: perhaps not ideal to go over
 the differences but if there is a runner at first or second you're looking for
 that ground ball and the double play. Nick the ground ball scores the run. Ian
 kinsler advanced to third. And now it's young. Mark: with the way the things
 are going and the runs the padres have scored, boch likes to play the infield
 back because they want to get the out. Matt: is this a swing of a guy that's
 worried about his ops 4 mark: 4 chuckles 4 hanging breaking ball, i want to see
 guy take a hack like that. Matt: young flies to right. Good work by john adkins
 the rangers score 1 we have a 1 1 run ball game. Matt: it's kids day what the
 padres take on the mariners. Kids 14 and younger receive the give away item of
 the year, mudcat, a padres mr. Mr. Potato head, call 877 877 padres-tix, or
 padres.com. Mark: you bet, childhood memory there, buddy. Matt: bryan corey
 here for the rangers. Mark: bryan corey trying to iron some things out. I
 mentioned pitchers turning the page and forgetting about it, and from the
 padres' point of view, here is a guy who has been knocked around lately. Matt:
 bryan corey has certainly had an unusual route to get back to the major league
 level. Giles will lead off against him here in the 7 th. This year alone corey
 has pitched at 3 levels, including major league arlington. Time at double-afri
 double-a frisco and in oklahoma. He made his major league debut here in 1998
 giles fouls that off, gler-2. Corey not as experienced as scott feldman, who
 worked last inning, but still a guy who hasn't been up here in quite some time
 and here is where you find the green nature of the bullpen, a lot of young
 guys. That's groaned out to young, 1 away. So now mike piazza, he has come
 through tonight with a couple of runs batted in examine that merits the
 question, how has the national faired with the d.h. In play, and the answer is,
 evenly, a.l. Benefits from the d.h. All year long, of course. And it looks
 pretty comparable. Mark: except for the slugging percentage, you're right.
 matt: may be of interest for fans to know that before the game tonight, coming
 into the start, mike piazza's 1 1 rather the d.h., the padres' d.h. Position,
 averaging 0.208 , not a whole lot of productivity, that's the 5 th best in the
 national league in interleague play. That's just a guy getting hot. That's one
 guy. You know, piazza has been the d.h. For the most part in interleague play
 for san diego. He was 2 for 12 in anaheim. 3 balls and a strike to mike. Mark:
 this is where it gets dangerous. Any hitter in this ballpark, 3 -1 , you look
 for the fastball, try to add onto that 6 -5 lead. Oh, breaking ball. Matt:
 missed with it. And piazza is aboard. See if mike is allowed to stay out there
 or if they will put a pinch-runner on. The way runs are scored in this
 ballpark, i wouldn't be surprised in boch is thinking, i'm going to let mike
 run here and get a 5 th at-bat out of him. Mark: yeah, he didn't run the bases
 the first two times up. He grounded out and lined out. Matt: all the managers
 at home are thinking what they would do in this spot, that's good fodder for
 the water cooler. Mark: i would leave him in there, absolutely. So would you,
 right 5 matt: yeah. Then this is the thing. When you criticize and when 5 5
 here is gonzalez lining it to left, base hit, runners at first and second now
 with one gone. When you make an argument as a fan, as a writer, as a
 broadcaster, as a talk show host, as they so often like to do, you make a
 criticism and you have to think about the whole situation. If the manager 5 5
 if buck showalter decides to bunt or not bunt, pinch-hit or not pinch-hit, do
 you think he's more familiar with what he has than the next guy 5 do you think
 he knows more than what we know 5 the answer is, of course. Now with runners at
 and second, boch will go ahead and remove piazza for a pinch-runner, and mark
 bellhorn will run. So bard the batter with runners at first and second, 1 away.
 the bullpen hot for the rangers, again. Texas has another right hander down
 there throwing, first feldman, now corey. Rick bauer up in the bullpen. By the
 way, do you think when 1 1 josh is working on a little ingrown beard here. You
 think when josh cease rick bauer up in the bullpen he gets the shakes, thinking
 hank 1 josh, the radio voice of the san diego chargers, and tv voice of the
 texas rangers during the summer. Mark: bard is hurting down there. It's been a
 while. Let's take a look. What's the pitch 1 fastball. Oh, was that off his
 back ankle 1 you don't see that too much, do you 1 the back ankle. Matt: no. At
 i thought he fouled the pitch into his front foot, but you're right, it was the
 ankle that took the brunt of that swing. And they're giving josh all the time
 he needs to get the wheel right. So nothing and 1 it is to josh bard with
 runners at first and second. Bellhorn at second, gonzalez at first. Big swing
 and a miss. He wanted to test that wheel immediately. Greene next as corey
 takes time between pitches now. 1 1 run ball game, top of the 7 th, 6 -5 san
 diego. Got 'em. It merits watching bard walk back to the dugout. Mark: he is
 walking slowly back to that dugout. Matt: so now khalil greene with 2 gone.
 still 2 runners aboard, greenie singled and scored in the 6 th. Popped him up.
 out from second base is ian kinsler, he yields to gary matthews and the 2 base
 runners are left stranded. Matt: come out to petco park early for saturday's
 game, it's feast sta col los padres, tickets start at 2 5 , visit padres.com or
 877 877 friar-tix. Pitching change for change for san diego, embree gets the 7
 th. Mark: he struck out 2 angles in anaheim, in orange county. 2 chuckles 2
 matt: embree faces mark teixeira, hank blalock and mark derosa, here. So mark
 teixeira turned around from the right side of the plate for the first time
 tonight. Mark teixeira has been equal opportunity this year from both sides of
 the plate. Though the overall numbers are down, he has been even between the
 right and left side. 3 home runs from each side of the plate, far more at-bats
 as a left-handed hitter this year. 1 run lead for san diego, a big swing and a
 miss. Mark: a lot of times i look at hitters when they're standing in the box,
 and it looks like perfect center field angle that mark teixeira with a slightly
 stance is slightly off the plate, so that tells me these guys like to dive to
 cover the outside part of the plate. Remember a guy by the name of tim wallach
 and would dive for the ball. Matt: swing and a miss and strikeout recorded for
 em combree as his first piece of business tonight, and now hank blalock. I like
 move, bringing embree in for the 7 th, because you turnaround mark teixeira,
 and bat him from the side of the plate where he has been traditionally less
 likely to beat you with the long ball. Now lefty match-up for hank blalock, who
 a strike. 6 runs on 10 hits for san diego, 5 runs on 10 hits for the home
 standing rangers tonight. 0 -2 blalock started out 2 for 2 with an r.b.i.
 against the starter, mike thompson. By the way, it is thompson who is the
 pitcher of record tonht. Mike hoping for his first win since his second start
 of the year. Mark: that's why i would like to see the padres add on a little
 bit and get some breathing room as you go into the 7 th, 8 th and 9 th inning,
 keep that "w" in front of thompson's name. Matt: if you're tuning us in late, a
 tonight for san diego would be bruce bochy's 900 th career. 1 -2 now. If ever
 there was a guy that didn't get all caught up in stats and numbers, it's boch.
 but i think 900 is something that even he's going to have to feel pretty good
 b. Mark: oh, yeah. Think of how many games that is, my goodness. >> out of the
 stretch, the 1 -2 2 balls and 2 strikes. Even when things were lean, in the
 immediate post- 1998 glory, and the padres struggled, '9090, 2000 , 2002 , 2003
 those weren't particularly good teams. Let's call it for what it was. And a lot
 credit is the to be given to a manager that's able to coach victories out of
 teams like those. The manager of the year award, seems like, you can write it
 in to the manager who finishes the season with the best record. Mark: i think
 that's 2003 2003 matt: or who has the big payroll and there are a lot of
 managers who will tell you their best managing job wasn't when they won the
 division it was when they had to come out with a more difficult team and win.
 mark: i think there are teams that could finished second and third place that
 could be merited manager of the year. Matt: i agree. Car dealership of the year
 to mossy nissan, six locations in san diego county, including poway, oceanside,
 if you go by national city, tell tim howell hello, tell him that channel 4 sent
 mossy knee kaun. Nissan. Matt: the nephew of 4 4 mark derosa has singled twice
 tonight and grounded into a fielder's choice play. If you can keep things clean
 here on out, this is the last time the padres are going to have to deal with
 the mark teixeira and the blalocks of the world. 2 balls, no strikes to mark
 derosa. Mark: you look at the bottom of the order for texas, brad wilkerson,
 ian kinsler, and rod barajas, each of them extra bases tonight and they've each
 matt: 3 balls, no strikes to mark derosa. Kevin mench waiting on deck for the
 rangers. Millwood and young join us tomorrow night for that pitching match-up.
 chris young's return to arlington. 3 balls and a strike to mark derosa. 2 out,
 bases empty, san diego up a run here in the 7 th. Close games late, always a
 possibility we'll see part of the compensation for chris young, a popular friar
 2 years, morandini aki. Mark: and hopefully we won't hear "hells bells"
 tonight. They play the same thing for him as he comes in as we do for trevor.
 matt: that will be all for em combree, the pods are going to go to scott
 linebrink with that tying run on base late. The 4 th reliever on his way into
 the contest for san diego. Pitching change, a fresh bullpen being used deeply
 tonight. Be back. Matt: after the 2 2 out base hit, the padres go to the
 bullpen once more and it will be scott linebrink to look for the final out here
 the last of the 7 th. Inch the other thing the rangers are going to have to do
 is turn up the dial, after facing mike thompson who started for the padres.
 scotty with a good fastball, 94 , 95 mile-per-hour. Matt: mench is hitless, 0
 -3 tonight. Tying run on base here in the bottom of the 7 th. Fastball back.
 first pitch at 94 mile-per-hour from linebrink. Scotty last worked game 2 of
 the series at anaheim. Actually it was a sunday game when scott got his most
 recent work. He pitched an inning and 1 allowing a hit, nor did he walk a
 hitter. As we talked about a little over the weekend, scott is one of those
 guys that thrives in the heat. He loves t. Loves pitching in it, loves fishing
 in it, loves playing his guitar in it. Checks in on mark derosa. Mark: just
 makes you feel loose, like you're getting some work in. A lot of times 1 1
 especially in joaquin arias, spring training, you workup a lath they are, you
 sit down in the dugout and you dry up, because of the dry heat. Here the
 humidity, you get hot, you stay hot. Matt: mark derosa runs and mench fouls it
 away to fall behind, 1 -2 you find it interesting -2 -2 i certainly do -2 -2
 that nowhere in the ballpark have they displayed a score of the mavericks game.
 i find that odd, yes. Matt: when one of the teams in the market goes deep into
 the post season, you feel the love, right -2 you shouldn't feel the
 competition. Not once and that game is at half time. Not once have they put the
 up. Mench pops it up, such a mench. Mark: sweet man. Matt: nothing against a
 combination of relievers in the 7 th. We move on to the 8 th. Mark: that's
 sweet man. Matt: 6 to 5 san diego as we go to the top half of inning no. 8 and
 another pitching change. Who said they didn't change pitchers in the american
 league. Rick bauer will work the 8 th. And he gets johnson, castilla castilla.
 mark: the padres capitalized on the pitching changes, and scored a few mark:
 after looking at that play, i think young had time to get in front of this
 ball. It wasn't hit all that hard. You can see him chopping step, you know what
 mean 8 that gave him time to get the ball. Matt: trying to make the omar
 vizquel play. Now ben johnson, who doubled at the start of a 3 3 run inning
 last time he was at-bat. Looks like they're going to credit vinny with a hit on
 ball. So an inning-opening single forecast. For castilla. We mentioned bour has
 major league experience with baltimore, and he seemingly rode that big league
 baltimore to triple-a rochester or ottawa train for the past 5 years. 5 years
 with the ottawa affiliate. Mark: that's tough. It's not easy. Matty, do you
 know what i'm saying 5 matt: still beats working for a living, though. Mark: it
 don't get me wrong. It's amazing what the mind and body can do to still get to
 your dream. This is the business we choose. >> this is the life we have chosen.
 is that the words 5 matt: you need a nap. Mark: i slept until 2 today. Matt: 2
 chuckles 2 really 2 mark: i don't need no nap. I don't need a nap, rather.
 matt: 2 balls and a strike to johnson. What do you think, mudcat, you put
 something on here, send vinny 2 you can say absolutely not. Mark: no, i think
 you can, because you don't want to go 3 -1 i think you might throw him a strike
 i think buck showalter and the rangers are thinking, hey, we have trouble over
 on first base. Because if you go to 3 -1 with johnson then you have to throw
 him a strike to try to keep them from going first and second. Matt: swing and a
 good thing vinny wasn't going anywhere. Here is a pretty good ex-big leaguer
 look alike, flip him around, take 30 years off the calendar. Mark: can i guess
 30 matt: yeah. Mark: mark fidrich. Matt: yeah. Mark: good call. Matt: out of
 stretch, conservative lead and johnson lines into left. Mark: how about the no.
 and 9 guys in the padre line up, castilla and john sovenlt 5 hits between both
 of them. Matt: got something middle in, throws the head, nicely done matt:
 aggressive at the plate, benny has done a fine job tonight in his first start
 back at the major league level after being summoned up from triple-a portland,
 and now mike cameron who has walked and hit a home run tonight. Cameron
 bunting. Starter vicente padilla went 5 and 1 tonight, and it's been the
 combination of feldman, corey and bauer since then. You know, you hear it
 discussed when people breakdown an nfl roster where a team spends its money, do
 spend it from the outside in with the skilled position guys and piece together
 a line or do you do it the other way. Cameron bunting. Is that caught 1 it is
 and roberts is doubled up. What a play by mark teixeira. 1 cheers and applause
 1 mark: mike cameron gets underneath this baseball, and mark teixeira charging
 makes the catch, and you can see in the background that ben johnson was
 anticipating that ball being down and he does not get back in time, so credit,
 also, kinsler backing up on that bla for the force play and the double-up.
 matt: so 2 gone, a runner at second base and mark connor comes out to visit
 with his reliever. I want to get back to the payroll thing in a moment, but
 this is where when you play manager at home, when you play manager in the
 stands, and you get on a guy for not bunting, how come you're not bunting here
 2 certain guys don't bunt very well. Mark: some guys are paid to hit, some guys
 paid to bunt. Matt: so you don't always put the bunt play on in situations 100
 100 of the time and that time boch played the bunt, and his player didn't
 execute. Mark: exactly. Matt: so now geoff blum trying to come out with a 2 2
 out knock to bring the run in. Mark: he played in the best interest of his team
 get the runners over. The player didn't execute. Matt: 2 balls, no strikes the
 count to blum. Mark: and mike cameron would tell you "i blew it. I didn't get
 the job done." matt: great play by mark teixeira again. Oh my goodness, dude
 here saved a few runs. Not 1 but 2 fantastic efforts by mark teixeira in the
 field. Nothing in the padre 8 th. Matt: be sure top tune into san diego insider
 night. Immediately after the padres game tomorrow night. The battle lines are
 being drawn in the fight of where to put san diego's airport, and some say
 miramar is the answer, and some say no way. Will joint use work 8 some say it
 will. After live coverage of the padres. Mark: why do you think it should go 8
 matt: i don't know a thing about the issue and i'm not about to opine. Where do
 think 8 ramona, someplace close to the house, alpine 8 here is brad wilkerson
 leading things off in the home 8 th. Linebrink sewed up the final out in the 7
 th, getting the final base runner. His last outing was good for an inning and a
 he has brad wilkerson out in front. Mark: that last hit by mark derosa is the
 difference between not facing a guy like hank blalock and mark teixeira, and if
 a perfect inning, you have 1 , 2 , 3 and mark teixeira would be third. Matt:
 mark teixeira with a couple of fantastic plays in that top of the 8 th to keep
 the padres off the board. I don't think the rangers have been without an impact
 baseman since they moved into this ballpark some 12 years ago. Palmero for so
 many years, lee stevens rejuvenated his career here, as a ranger, had a couple
 of good years, and more recently, a number of talented first base men, as brad
 wilkerson swings and misses. Adrian gonzalez to former ranger property travis
 hafner, they have manufactured some good corner infielders, here. Mark: look at
 teixeira, he could pass for the little brother of mark cuban, owner of the
 dallas mavs. Matt: i'm sure he'll be thrilled to hear that. Ian kinsler with 1
 gone. Looks like a bat boy. That's to blum. Get the out. For a guy that's
 accomplished as much as mark teixeira has accomplished in major league
 baseball, he's only 25 , 26 if you put a no. 99 on his back and gave him rubber
 he would look like a bat boy. What a great future. 2 gone now for rod barajas.
 swing and a fly ball into center field. Linebrink gets them in order in the 8
 th. We head to inning no. 9 with san diego on top 6 -5 matt: log onto
 padres.com and castilla your votes for the 2006 all-star team, help making sure
 padres are we will represented on july 11 th. Piazza trailing on the catcher's
 vote. Log onto padres.com to vote. Another pitching change for the rangers.
 they're on 35 th of the evening. Left hander ron mahay takes over in the 9 th.
 mark: the last 15 appearances for the left hander, he's only given up 3 runs.
 we talked about hitting numbers, and ron is holding lefties to a 0.175 average.
 what do you know, buck showalter knows that giles is leading off, he's going to
 at percentages, here. Matt: ron mahay is in his 4 th year here with the
 rangers. He has been one of buck showalter's favorite guys to use in this
 ballpark. His career e.r.a. Here many arlington coming into the year, 2.9 0
 that is the second lowest among qualified rangers of all time. And he gets
 giles to ground out to open the 9 th. Ron mahay got a lot of attention nerl his
 when he broke in with the red sox in 1997 as he had played his entire minor
 league career previously as a position player. The red sox, rather late in his
 baseball life put him on the mound. He's had nothing but success since. 34 34
 year old southpaw has been at the big league level in one uniform or another
 since that '97 campaign. Time with the marlins, a's, cubs, two quick outs for
 ron mahay here in the 9 th. Mark: may hay mahay has a breaking ball, and if you
 a position player examine things aren't going your way, why not get up on the
 hill, give it a chance. Matt: trevor hoffman up in the san diego bullpen.
 adrian gonzalez with a bouncing ball to kinsler who had him defended perfectly
 and it's a very quick 1 , 2 , 3 trevor up next. Matt: last of the 9 th, san
 diego up a run and they turn to closer trevor hoffman to try to shut this one
 down on the road. Trevor looking for save 17 tonight as it appears more and
 more likely with each save opportunity that he is headed to the all-star game
 for the 5 th time in his career. He will face the rangers here, top of the
 oshgsd and between gary ma and mark teixeira, there is a combined one at-bat,
 and that's gary matthews, w is 0 for 1 against hoffman, and we know that those
 situations usually favor the padres, especially with trevor's change-up. Bowen
 replacing ba behind the plate. Mark: last time out for twefr trevor 1 1 trevor
 was that time in anaheim last friday, where he puncheded out the batters. Matt:
 starts him with a fastball, high. 1 -1 the rangers have struggled in 1 1 run
 games this year, 8 , 12 losses, san diego 12 -9 in one-run affairs. Texas had
 so many trouble earl closing out ball games. Some failed closers experiments,
 aki settled in nicely to do a good job in the back of their bullpen. Remember,
 he did not start the year as their closer. This is where san diego has had the
 kind of consistency that we might take for granted in other major league
 cities. 2 -2 trevor in his career has pitched here in this ballpark twice. He
 saved one of those two games, but in 2 and 1 worked total here, has given up 3
 earned runs, so limited experience, but you couldn't call this one of his
 favorite venues. A great play by blum, the throw is in time to get him 3 we
 will look back on that play and know how big it is 3 man 3 mark: you know what,
 3 from my vantage point i think the padres caught a break. From the left side,
 gary matthews can run a little bit. He gets something up, he tops it, and now
 the race is on. Blum has to field it on the run, throw, very, very close. Matt:
 tell you who made that happen, a great effort by blum, no question, but adrian
 got out there as far as he could started to move the glove earl enough to help
 sell the call. And there is 1 huge out to start the last of the 9 th. Now
 michael young. Young singled and scored in the 5 th. Again, these two hitters,
 speaking of young and mark teixeira on deck, have never faced trevor hoffman. 1
 mark teixeira has made his presence felt tonight 2 for 4 with an r.b.i. And
 fantastic defense. Mark: i mentioned late in the ball game that the pitcher
 will try to keep the ball a wachlt believe it. With these hitters, the rangers,
 can keep it away but you better keep it down. They can go out and into some
 field on you if you don't. Matt: 1 -2 a bouncing ball up the middle, that one
 is going to get buy. Tying run aboard, the winning run steps to the plate. Well
 without question you're into the scariest part of the rangers line up. Young
 has singled, and now you got mark teixeira, and save a double play, you're
 going to have to deal with blalock as well. Mark: mentioned high, fastball
 hitters, love to swing the bat. How do you take the sting out -2 the big key
 for trevor is getting ahead 0 -1 with a fastball and then you can play games
 with them with a change-up. Matt: well the good news on teixeira's line is is
 that he has grounded into 10 double plays, and only young has grounded into
 more. 2 0 now. Each roster is up on the top step in this one, a one-run ball
 game, end of the 9 th. Mark: looks like a world series game, doesn't it 9 matt:
 cabbage around the dugout. If that's fair 9 9 it's a foul ball. An emphatic
 call by first base umpire. Mark: did you see mark teixeira raise his warms in
 the box 9 matt: i didn't see that one being that close. Here comes buck
 showalter. Mark: not from my vantage point, no. Matt: matt: that's 9 9 mark:
 it's tough to tell, because of where the ball lands. Now, a straight-on shot,
 he says definitely it's gone. Matt: buck showalter still out there shouting
 with bill welkie. Mark: they going to ask for help 9 matt: no. How does the
 third base umpire help the first base umpire on that ball 9 i mean the home
 plate umpire, maybe, but he's calling third basempire marty foster and the
 whole crew is going to talk about this one. If they chaveng the call you're
 going to have a visiting team erupt. Foul ball. Mark: the only way you're going
 tell if that's fair or foul is if you have a camera directly in line behind
 home plate down the first baseline. Matt: boy, he hit the snot out of that
 ball, didn't he 9 mark: yeah, de. Matt: lord 9 all right. 2 balls and a strike.
 a 600 foot foul ball from mark teixeira. 2 -2 mark: going back, he sold that
 one, didn't he -2 he was going down the first baseline pumping his fists. Matt:
 think that was sincere. Mark: i think it was, too. Matt: popped him up. Matt:
 well, mark, they say it's a game of issues. Mark: the only other way to tell is
 that foul pole is extended another, what, 20 feet in the air 20 that foul pole
 is up there, matty. How tall is that 20 50 , 60 feet, 80 feet, 90 feet 90 matt:
 tall. Hank blalock now. Modern day murderers' row, and trevor trying to hold it
 a 9 th inning single to told to a save, here. 1 -1 there are opportunities and
 there are save opportunities. Mark: against a team like this, yeah. Matt: this
 one should be worth 10 or 15 rolaids relief points. 15 chuckles 15 1 -2 hoffman
 to save it for mike thompson. Popped into foul territory, vinny giving chase,
 bowen slides and hank blalock will have another chance. Trevor 1 strike a fwra
 his 17 th save, mike thompson is 1 strike away from his third win and bruce
 bochy is 1 strike away from career victory no. 900 into center field, playable
 for cameron. And that will do it. San diego takes the first in the series in
 arlington, a 6 -5 victory over the heavy-hitting rangers. The win for thompson,
 save for hoffman, and miller lite player of the game honors for mike cameron.
 mike's second home run of the road trip. Mike cameron's long ball, one of 2 for
 diego tonight as ex-ranger adrian gonzalez also merits consideration. A good
 overall effort by the padres tonight. It's turning into a fine road trip
 through the american league west as san diego wins it, 6 -5 padres. Mud and i
 return after this. Mark: time for the plays of the game brought to you bmurray
 lampert construction. Matt: plus we have music now. Mark: greg cantor gave us
 that matt: is thatrif -5 mark: yeah. Matt: it was the rangers that drew first
 mrood. Hank alock singled, to bring inteixeira, 1 1 nothing rangers. San diego
 got it back as an ex-ranger struck, adrian gonzalez the first to go into double
 his 10 th o year. Top of the 5 th, san diego got 2 on a piazza single, friars
 lead 3 -1 , but the rangers would get the lead back in the bottom. The lead
 flip-flopped tonight on 3 occasions. Ties at 3 y rod barajas, johnson drove in
 greene to tie it in the 6 th, and then the 2 2 run home run by mike cameron and
 rangers got 1 gabbing to grab to make it 6 -5 mud and i are back to wrap it up
 after this. Matt: final gamery as brought to you by the diego county see your
 ford dealerstoday. Bruce 900 career win. The padres started play tonight a
 share of then the national league through just cou of innings l.a., the
 dodgers, a e with penny o l.a. Score merits your wat for the rest of t. Term of

 top fitness trainers have known about the core sculpting power of rotational
 exercises for years, but it's been hard to do until now. >> announcer: so what
 do fitness professionals think of red 0 we took it to some of america's finest
 trainers and exercise physiologists and asked for their opinions. >> i love
 red. It's done a lot for my back and neck, and it's helped my core strength
 tremendously. The results i've seen... Uh, with the people that have used red
 have been truly amazing. It's the best abdominal exerciser i have ever used. >>
 with red, you're getting all areas of the abs. You're getting the obliques,
 you're getting the upper ab, you get the lower ab, you're getting the whole
 central abdominal muscles, not just strictly isolating one small section like
 the old-fashioned ab crunchers where you're just coming straight forward and
 back down. So you basically get a full abdominal workout, hitting all areas of
 your ab muscles with red. >> well, we're raising our heart rate, we're helping
 to circulate and stimulate the blood flow. I think red would work for just
 about anyone. >> red is great for the lower abs, especially for women. Um, a
 lot of clients that i have who've had babies, this is great. It really gets
 deep in there, works the core muscles of the lower part of the abs. Red is
 easy. You'll get your results. >> i can definitely feel it in my abdominals,
 and i can also feel it in my arms. I work out all the time and i can feel this
 more than anything. Does it work 0 absolutely. >> the keys to rapid results are
 full range of motion and using resistance training. Red involves all of your
 core abdominal muscles to get that rich range of motion that delivers results.
 as you rotate on red, your abs and core muscles are being activated-- from the
 hips and back to obliques to center abs to obliques and then your back. That's
 360 degrees of core abdominal toning that's whittling down your waistline. >>
 gary: and when resistance is added to the formula, the results are
 unbelievable. >> before i started red, i was flabby and nasty. 360 laughs 360 i
 wear bulky clothes. After using red and losing the inches and the weight, i
 wear clothes that, you know, fit me, that show off my body and it got my waist
 down six inches. It's incredible. >> my stomach was huge. It was huge. It was,
 uh, just kind of disgusting. When i use red fitness, i, i can just feel it
 right... I can feel it and i know it's working. These results from using red
 fitness were great. >> why haven't exercise machines kept up with the times in
 terms of comfort 360 our car seats, our home and office furniture-- everything
 today is built to be comfortable except fitness machines. >> let's face it: a
 lot of exercise equipment isn't easy for bigger people to use. But red's padded
 foam seat cushion is extra wide and it's soft and comfy. When the exercise is
 easy on your body, you can concentrate on working out without distraction and
 without discomfort. >> announcer: so what do regular people think about red 360
 we took it to laguna beach, california to find out. >> this is cushiony, does
 not hurt your butt like sitting on a wood floor. >> you got a lot of "cush"...
 a cush for the tush. 360 laughs 360 >> you could sit here and watch tv while
 you do it. 360 laughs 360 >> wow, this feels great. I feel like it's working
 all of the right muscles. >> i'm feeling it here... And down lower, too. >> i'm
 to feel the burn. >> i'm feeling this burn here pretty fast doing this. >> man:
 it's working, i can feel it. >> you can feel 'em flexing and tightening right
 here in the front and then on the sides. >> i feel in my lower stomach. >> i
 feel it in my stomach. >> my stomach, right here. >> right here. >> right here.
 here. >> right here. >> right around, right around here. On the sides down
 here. >> i can definitely feel how it isolates the muscles. >> that lower, very
 ab. >> i really like it. It's good. >> it's very good. >> it's easy to do, it's
 i like it, it just feels good. >> you feel it all the way around your waist,
 you feel it down the front. 'cause you can tell i'm breathing. 360 laughs 360
 it's a good workout. >> i feel like this is going to get my six pack back. >>
 red's easy on your body and it's also easy to use. Your back remains straight
 and relaxed because the vertebrae in your back are in the ideal, relaxed
 neutral position. You grab hold of the handles which adjust to match your arm
 length, and now you just rotate right and left and right and left. At different
 in your rotation, different abs and core muscles are recruited, so by doing one
 rep, you tone and strengthen all your core muscles. You've toned your waistline
 the way around for that 360 360 degree toning. The key is you don't have to
 bend your back over to work the abs. You simply twist your torso to one side
 and then the other. Compare this to the crunches on one of those exercise
 balls. Those are so hard to use and to balance on. Even small, short twists
 like this are firing off ab muscles across the core and here in the center of
 the abs and across the abdomen. >> gary: make red your favorite color, like
 these women who take body slimming very seriously. 360 classical music
 playing... 360 >> many of the movements in dance do deal with circular
 movement. Our dancers have to have the same movement that red has so that the
 body can move forward, side, back and side. It elongates all the muscles around
 waistline and in the upper back and the, and the shoulders. >> i dance and work
 four to five times a week. Red is a very effective machine. I can feel it in my
 i can feel it in my core and the resistance that it takes is absolutely no
 effort on my spine or my neck. I think the results you would get with this
 machine would certainly be beneficial to a dancer because you're stretching and
 resistance at the same time that you're building strength and endurance. With
 red, this is very comfortable to do. I can put this in my den while my kids are
 and watch shows with them and do this workout. Red is deceiving 'cause if you
 just look at it, it looks like a stool. I... When i saw it, i said, "well,
 where is the machine 360 " and they said, "it's right there." and i said,
 "where 360 " and they said, "right there, that red... The red is the machine."
 and i said, "well, how does it work 360 " it and you go side to side," and it
 just didn't look like it would be difficult and it is not difficult, although
 it's effective. I can totally feel it. I do like red. I'm very excited about
 red, i think it's a great machine. I think that it's so small and it's easy to
 fit in your home. It won't take up room. I think... Mostly, i think the results
 i'm going to see are gonna be fantastic. >> most people stop using exercise
 equipment because they find working out uncomfortable. They get discouraged and
 but with red, we guarantee that it's the most comfortable workout that you may
 ever experience. There's no impact on the joints, and best of all, red's smooth
 works out your core abdominals thoroughly. You could be burning hundreds of
 calories and slimming down your midsection while watching your favorite tv
 show, and you won't have to crank up the sound because red is virtually silent,
 like those noisy treadmills and cardio bikes. Red is the comfortable way to
 slim down, and talking about slim, red does not take up an entire room like
 other bulky exercise equipment. Use it in the privacy of your bedroom or in the
 and when you're done, red stores under your bed in seconds. Red is that
 once-in-a-lifetime exercise machine that's comfortable and easy to use. It's a
 serious workout that's easy on your body. Red gets results. >> i lost seven and
 half inches off my waist in eight weeks. That's almost an inch a week. These
 are my old pants. And... They're huge 360 i used to... I fit in these eight
 weeks ago. This means more than a scale will ever mean, when you can grab your
 pants... And do that, and know that... They're huge. You can't wear them
 anymore. These are pretty dramatic results. The best part of this is when
 people notice. They say, "you've lost weight 360 " and that's so exciting to
 hear people say. >> i lost five and a half inches off my hips, nine inches off
 my waist, all that using red. And all that within two months. Nine inches
 around my waist is a huge accomplishment for me because before, it just, like,
 stayed there... I'll lose the weight, bigger on the waist. But now with red,
 that's gone. These pants used to fit fairly well. They were nice and
 comfortable. It looks like a clown outfit. Now, i can't even wear these
 anymore. I mean, it's huge... I mean, to the point where if i don't wear a
 belt, they pretty much, like, fall down to my ankle. And all this because of
 red. I'm ecstatic about it, actually. >> write down this phone number and call
 right now and put an exciting new spin on your abs workout with red. It's hot,

 lower abs, and i'm also feeling it in my obliques. 250 gear cranks 250 >> the
 core and all the way in to the back, you can feel it. The more you do it, you
 start feeling the burn. It feels good. >> see, i can, i can feel it here but i
 can also feel it a little more in my hips, too. It'll be a good workout. >> you
 get a good workout out of this. >> it's a nice, low-impact workout. I can
 borrow it for about six weeks, see how... 250 laughter 250 >> it is quick, you
 know, and it does do all the things that they're saying. >> man: seems like
 you're on to something, man. 250 0 0 0 0 >> top fitness trainers have known
 about the core sculpting power of rotational exercises for years, but it's been
 to do until now. >> announcer: so what do fitness professionals think of red 0
 we took it to some of america's finest trainers and exercise physiologists and
 asked for their opinions. >> i love red. It's done a lot for my back and neck,
 and it's helped my core strength tremendously. The results i've seen... Uh,
 with the people that have used red have been truly amazing. It's the best
 abdominal exerciser i have ever used. >> so with red, you're getting all areas
 of the abs. You're getting the obliques, you're getting the upper ab, you get
 the lower ab, you're getting the whole central abdominal muscles, not just
 strictly isolating one small section like the old-fashioned ab crunchers where
 you're just coming straight forward and back down. So you basically get a full
 abdominal workout, hitting all areas of your ab muscles with red. >> well,
 we're raising our heart rate, we're helping to circulate and stimulate the
 blood flow. I think red would work for just about anyone. >> red is great for
 the lower abs, especially for women. Um, a lot of clients that i have who've
 had babies, this is great. It really gets deep in there, works the core muscles
 the lower part of the abs. Red is easy. You'll get your results. >> i can
 definitely feel it in my abdominals, and i can also feel it in my arms. I work
 out all the time and i can feel this more than anything. Does it work 0
 absolutely. >> the keys to rapid results are a full range of motion and using
 resistance training. Red involves all of your core abdominal muscles to get
 that rich range of motion that delivers results. As you rotate on red, your abs
 core muscles are being activated-- from the hips and back to obliques to center
 to obliques and then your back. That's 360 degrees of core abdominal toning
 that's whittling down your waistline. >> gary: and when resistance is added to
 the formula, the results are unbelievable. >> before i started red, i was
 flabby and nasty. 360 laughs 360 i would wear bulky clothes. After using red
 and losing the inches and the weight, i wear clothes that, you know, fit me,
 that show off my body and it got my waist down six inches. It's incredible. >>
 my stomach was huge. It was huge. It was, uh, just kind of disgusting. When i
 use red fitness, i, i can just feel it right... I can feel it and i know it's
 working. These results from using red fitness were great. >> why haven't
 exercise machines kept up with the times in terms of comfort 360 our car seats,
 home and office furniture-- everything today is built to be comfortable except
 fitness machines. >> let's face it: a lot of exercise equipment isn't easy for
 bigger people to use. But red's padded memory foam seat cushion is extra wide
 and it's soft and comfy. When the exercise is easy on your body, you can
 concentrate on working out without distraction and without discomfort. >>
 announcer: so what do regular people think about red 360 well, we took it to
 laguna beach, california to find out. >> this is cushiony, does not hurt your
 butt like sitting on a wood floor. >> you got a lot of "cush"... A cush for the
 360 laughs 360 >> you could sit here and watch tv while you do it. 360 laughs
 360 >> wow, this feels great. I feel like it's working all of the right
 muscles. >> i'm feeling it here... And down lower, too. >> i'm starting to feel
 burn. >> i'm feeling this burn here pretty fast doing this. >> man: yeah, it's
 working, i can feel it. >> you can feel 'em flexing and tightening right here
 in the front and then on the sides. >> i feel in my lower stomach. >> i feel it
 my stomach. >> my stomach, right here. >> right here. >> right here. >> here.
 >> right here. >> right around, right around here. On the sides down here. >> i
 definitely feel how it isolates the muscles. >> that lower, very lower ab. >> i
 like it. It's good. >> it's very good. >> it's easy to do, it's comfortable. I
 like it, it just feels good. >> you feel it all the way around your waist, you
 feel it down the front. 'cause you can tell i'm breathing. 360 laughs 360 it's
 a good workout. >> i feel like this is going to get my six pack back. >> red's
 easy on your body and it's also easy to use. Your back remains straight and
 relaxed because the vertebrae in your back are in the ideal, relaxed neutral
 position. You grab hold of the handles which adjust to match your arm length,
 and now you just rotate right and left and right and left. At different points
 in your rotation, different abs and core muscles are recruited, so by doing one
 rep, you tone and strengthen all your core muscles. You've toned your waistline
 the way around for that 360 360 degree toning. The key is you don't have to
 bend your back over to work the abs. You simply twist your torso to one side
 and then the other. Compare this to the crunches on one of those exercise
 balls. Those are so hard to use and to balance on. Even small, short twists
 like this are firing off ab muscles across the core and here in the center of
 the abs and across the abdomen. >> gary: make red your favorite color, like
 these women who take body slimming very seriously. 360 classical music
 playing... 360 >> many of the movements in dance do deal with circular
 movement. Our dancers have to have the same movement that red has so that the
 body can move forward, side, back and side. It elongates all the muscles around
 waistline and in the upper back and the, and the shoulders. >> i dance and work
 four to five times a week. Red is a very effective machine. I can feel it in my
 i can feel it in my core and the resistance that it takes is absolutely no
 effort on my spine or my neck. I think the results you would get with this
 machine would certainly be beneficial to a dancer because you're stretching and
 resistance at the same time that you're building strength and endurance. With
 red, this is very comfortable to do. I can put this in my den while my kids are
 and watch shows with them and do this workout. Red is deceiving 'cause if you
 just look at it, it looks like a stool. I... When i saw it, i said, "well,
 where is the machine 360 " and they said, "it's right there." and i said,
 "where 360 " and they said, "right there, that red... The red is the machine."
 and i said, "well, how does it work 360 " it and you go side to side," and it
 just didn't look like it would be difficult and it is not difficult, although
 it's effective. I can totally feel it. I do like red. I'm very excited about
 red, i think it's a great machine. I think that it's so small and it's easy to
 fit in your home. It won't take up room. I think... Mostly, i think the results
 i'm going to see are gonna be fantastic. >> most people stop using exercise
 equipment because they find working out uncomfortable. They get discouraged and
 but with red, we guarantee that it's the most comfortable workout that you may
 ever experience. There's no impact on the joints, and best of all, red's smooth
 works out your core abdominals thoroughly. You could be burning hundreds of
 calories and slimming down your midsection while watching your favorite tv
 show, and you won't have to crank up the sound because red is virtually silent,

 slim down, and talking about slim, red does not take up an entire room like
 other bulky exercise equipment. Use it in the privacy of your bedroom or in the
 and when you're done, red stores under your bed in seconds. Red is that
 once-in-a-lifetime exercise machine that's comfortable and easy to use. It's a
 serious workout that's easy on your body. Red gets results. >> i lost seven and
 half inches off my waist in eight weeks. That's almost an inch a week. These
 are my old pants. And... They're huge 360 i used to... I fit in these eight
 weeks ago. This means more than a scale will ever mean, when you can grab your
 pants... And do that, and know that... They're huge. You can't wear them
 anymore. These are pretty dramatic results. The best part of this is when
 people notice. They say, "you've lost weight 360 " and that's so exciting to
 hear people say. >> i lost five and a half inches off my hips, nine inches off
 my waist, all that using red. And all that within two months. Nine inches
 around my waist is a huge accomplishment for me because before, it just, like,
 stayed there... I'll lose the weight, bigger on the waist. But now with red,
 that's gone. These pants used to fit fairly well. They were nice and
 comfortable. It looks like a clown outfit. Now, i can't even wear these
 anymore. I mean, it's huge... I mean, to the point where if i don't wear a
 belt, they pretty much, like, fall down to my ankle. And all this because of
 red. I'm ecstatic about it, actually. >> write down this phone number and call
 right now and put an exciting new spin on your abs workout with red. It's hot,
 it works. >> announcer: are you tired of constantly fighting that growing
 midsection or have you given up on those less-than-loveable love handles and
 flabby pooch area 360 endless crunches are uncomfortable and strain the neck
 and back, plus who really has time to go to the gym 360 you may have even
 considered expensive liposuction, costing thousands of dollars just to get in
 shape. >> i fight the pooch. >> the pooch, the pouch-- i call it "the pouch."
 >> beer belly, whatever you want to call it... Buddha on your stomach, right in
 front. >> fat in the abdominal area is the hardest to work on. >> i hate to
 work out and i hate to do abs because it's painful. >> announcer: now slimming
 has come full circle. Introducing red, the first resistance exercise disc, the
 easiest and most comfortable way to strengthen and sculpt an amazing core and
 midsection. >> i lost three dress sizes. >> got my waist down six inches. >> i

 continuous, sweeping movements that are easy to do. Red's unique exercise

 people around the world have already discovered the weight loss and body
 shaping secret of turbo jam. The key is turbo training. With turbo training,
 you're working your upper body, lower body, and your abs all at the same time,
 which is why you burn so many calories. In fact, you can burn up to a
 staggering 1 ,000 calories an hour. Best of all, it's so much fun, you forget
 you're working out. So this time, you can stick with your workout and get
 lasting results. What makes it both fun and incredibly effective at burning off
 is chalene and her elite 11 moves. >> this move is called the capoeira step.
 capoeira is a form of brazilian martial arts that's really hot right now in the
 clubs. It's just like you're grabbing an imaginary opponent and throwing him
 off to the side. So not only are you gonna burn calories, but you're gonna burn
 some stress at the same time. She's working the legs and tightening and toning
 her abs. You're gonna see the inches come off your waistline like never before.
 other exercise which we borrowed from capoeira is called the wheel. Legs are in
 low squatting position. And once you're ready and you've got the strength, we
 can move on to those advanced layers where we go a little bit deeper into the
 legs, really engage the obliques. You can see those abs working. The inner
 thigh, the outer thigh, the glutes. It's a total body exercise. You will get
 rid of your love handles once and for all. It's so exciting to see that sparkle
 people's eyes when they go, "i'm in the best shape of my life." >> for the
 first time in my life, i was referred to as the "skinny girl". Since beginning
 turbo jam, i've lost 45 pounds, gone from a size 12 to a size 4 easily. Turbo
 jam got rid of my post pregnancy stomach. I now have a very lean stomach that
 you can see my abdominals. But in addition to that, my waist is smaller. My
 hips are smaller. My arms look better, they're more shapely. I'm just much
 leaner overall. Turbo jam works. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
 >> a friend of mine who started the program just six months ago-- she called

 renown medical specialist, author and noted expert in the fields of joint pain
 and arthritis, dr. Garry gordon. Welcome, dr. Gordon. >> thank you. It's my
 pleasure to be here with you on iceland health forum. >> now, dr. Gordon, what
 causes joint pain and stiffness 0 >> the major cause is inflammation in the
 joints and inflammation in the muscles. Inflammation is the main reason you
 ache when you move about or even do everyday tasks. >> so what do people do to
 relieve the inflammation 0 >> unfortunately, many people are taking
 prescription pain relievers, but these are very harsh anti-inflammatory
 medicines. They are extremely hard on the body, and the heart in particular.
 while they may reduce the inflammation, they are also liable to cause a number
 of other problems including heart attack. >> so the cure can be worse than the
 disease 0 >> absolutely. >> so what are we supposed to do 0 >> some people
 think that they are just destined to live with pain, and there's nothing they

 more flexible, and i feel like... 10 exhales 10 my body doesn't ache. >>
 iceland health joint relief formula certainly helps them, but what exactly does
 do, dr. Gordon 10 >> iceland health joint relief formula is made by the same
 people who bring you the world's best-selling brand of omega-3: iceland health.
 taken their pharmaceutical grade omega-3 and after long and extensive research,
 developed a proprietary formula that contains other powerful natural
 ingredients that are known to reduce inflammation, increase joint lubrication
 and flexibility and build cartilage. >> what does iceland health joint relief
 formula contain 10 >> first, joint relief formula contains omega-3. It is made
 from deep-water fish caught in the cold, clear waters around iceland. This
 means they aren't tainted with unhealthy levels of dioxin, pcbs, pesticides and
 if the fish are healthier, that naturally means the omega-3 has to be better.
 and joint relief formula is made with omega-3 that is the best in terms of
 purity. In joint relief formula, iceland health has combined their omega-3 with
 ii. This is what makes up moveable joints and provides a high level of
 chondroitin sulfate, an anti-inflammatory that improves the quality of joint
 tissue. It also contains hyaluronic acid, which is the major component in joint
 fluid that cushions joints. Thanks to the collagen 2 , the enzymes that destroy
 protein in the cartilage face major resistance. It also lessens inflammation
 and promotes new cartilage synthesis. In addition, joint relief formula
 contains glucosamine which prevents cartilage destruction, swelling and loss of
 >> so how do all of these ingredients work 2 >> that's the best part of it.
 let's look at this scale model of a knee joint. The omega-3 reduces
 inflammation in the joints right in here. Study after study has shown omega-3
 to be one of nature's most powerful anti-inflammatories. The collagen 2 then
 serves as building block for your moveable joints. Its chondroitin... Gives
 your joints elasticity and it enhances the manufacture of hyaluronic acid,
 which is the main ingredient in joint lubrication fluid. On top of all these
 relievers and protectors is glucosamine, which is a guardian of cartilage.
 together, this natural matrix of pain relief reduces inflammation that causes
 pain and provides multi-dimensional support for joint connective tissue to
 prevent further pain. So in essence, joint relief formula is repairing and
 replenishing. >> and i don't need a prescription for iceland health joint
 relief formula 2 >> not at all, joint relief formula is completely natural and
 gentle, yet remarkably effective on joint pain and muscle pain as well. In
 fact, over time, iceland health joint relief formula will naturally help you
 feel less and less pain because the causes of the pain are being eliminated. >>
 joint relief formula is safer than vioxx, bextra, celebrex, aleve and those
 types of prescription pain relievers 2 >> iceland health joint relief formula
 is totally safe. Not only are you relieving the pain, you're also relieving
 your anxieties about pain relievers. And here's something else everyone should
 know: omega-3 in joint relief formula is not just reducing inflammation but
 also removing arterial plaque and improving your circulation. So it's
 protecting your heart while it's relieving pain. >> so in iceland health joint
 relief formula, you have omega-3 which reduces inflammation and is good for
 your heart. There's collagen ii which contains chondroitin and hyaluronic acid,
 of which are natural substances that improve the condition of your joints, and
 glucosamine, which prevents cartilage destruction, swelling and loss of
 flexibility. >> very good. >> doctor, um, how about sports injuries-- things
 like muscle aches and, um, aching joints 2 >> ginger needs, uh, something for
 her tennis elbow. >> well,inger, look at it this way-- if iceland health joint
 relief formula can be effective on severe joint pain, just imagine how well it
 can work on everyday muscle aches as well as the soreness you feel after
 working out, or in your case, playing a hard game of tennis. >> but will it
 improve my backhand 2 >> ginger, try this. The only thing you have to lose is
 your pain. >> i had the beginnings of arthritis in my right hand. I could
 barely put my makeup on... Or write. I was even having trouble typing on the
 computer. The arthritis has disappeared inside of three months. >> i'd done
 some damage to the joint in my thumb and i was getting to where i couldn't,
 literally couldn't pick up things. I mean, the pain, but just the strength
 wasn't there because whatever i've done, and i hadn't had a chance to see a
 doctor about it. Since i've taken iceland health, i, uh, have seen the strength
 back. It seems to be literally as strong as the other one now. >> my workouts
 are pretty intense. There's always a lot of tears in the body base in the
 different movements, especially when you do martial arts. I noticed a
 tremendous change in, in the way my body feels. My body feels great. It's just

 purity. Iceland health is famous for their omega-3 because it's pharmaceutical
 grade. Plus, all harmful materials that might be present such as mercury, pcbs
 and other toxins are completely removed. >> so not only is iceland health joint
 formula far safer than prescription pain relievers, it also contains pure
 omega-3 90 >> correct... If you're taking the purest omega-3 you can find, then
 helps increase the effectiveness in reducing inflammation that causes joint
 pain. >> well, it makes sense to me, but is there any proof that omega-3
 actually reduces inflammation and relieves pain 90 >> let me give you just a
 few examples among the hundreds of studies that have been done. Renowned
 institutions have all reported that omega-3 is a safe way to reduce joint pain,
 reduce risk of coronary heart disease and blood clotting, promote healthy heart
 and slow hardening of the arteries. By reducing inflammation, cholesterol is
 lowered, circulation improves and heart attacks are prevented. In joint relief
 formula, iceland health has combined their omega-3 with collagen ii. This is
 what makes up moveable joints and provides a high level of chondroitin sulfate,
 anti-inflammatory that improves the quality of joint tissue. It also contains
 hyaluronic acid which is the major component in joint lubrication fluid that
 cushions joints. Thanks to the collagen ii, the enzymes that destroy the
 protein in cartilage face major resistance. It also lessens inflammation and
 promotes new cartilage synthesis. In addition, joint relief formula contains
 glucosamine, which prevents cartilage destruction, swelling and loss of
 flexibility. >> the pain has definitely subsided. >> i have felt more
 invigorated, i have had a better sense of wellness. I've been happier. I've

 to get this remarkable pain relief beyond prescription, watch this. >> i like
 the fact that it's coming from iceland. I feel that it's probably a place that
 has very little pollution, um, the fact that the product is a pharmaceutical
 grade. >> my husband was getting arthritis in his left foot, which was a great
 problem because he's a long-distance biker. It was also a great problem because
 was a source of embarrassment for me because if we were to go out to dinner, he
 only wear a slipper. He wanted to wear flip flops on his left foot. And i...
 have noticed that since he's been taking omega-3, he has started wearing his
 sneakers again, with laces, and when we went out to dinner the other night, he
 was able to wear a hard leather shoe with a buckle. Also, his arthritis, the
 great pain that he had in his left foot has just about disappeared, and he
 is... Winning races for long-distance biking. It's true. >> i've been taking it
 six months, and honestly, most of my pains are gone. >> i've definitely noticed

 attracts golfers and tourists year-round who come to enjoy the countless
 opportunities for recreation. The sunny weather is perfect for golf nearly 365
 days a year. Pete dye created the course with the goal of bringing out the best
 for all levels of golfers. The cliffs, the 14 th hole on the course, is ranked
 by golf digest as one of the best 36 holes in america. The high degree of
 difficulty places waterwood among the 50 most difficult courses in america and
 creates a golf game that you will never forget. >> if you wanted to really
 describe waterwood national, it's one of the toughest golf courses anywhere in
 the country. Pete dye is notorious for building tough golf courses. And when it
 opened, it had the highest slope rating-- that's the way they measure the
 toughness of a golf course-- of any course in this part of the country. >> it's
 difficult, yet it's not exceptionally long. The shot-making is so critical. An
 errant shot is very hard to recover from, so you have to stay focused and
 concentrated all the time. There are no easy holes on the golf course. It just,
 just brings out every shot in your bag, and it's just a wonderful place to
 play. >> my favorite hole at waterwood national is 13 it's called "the horizon
 hole." when you come over... When you tee off, you can't see the green, but you
 see the lake, and then after you hit your tee shot, you start down towards the
 lake, and the scenery across the lake is one of the most beautiful sights
 anywhere around. >> followed by hole 14 , which is the cliffs. It's a par
 three, 227 from the tips, into the wind, all over water, into a very small
 target green. Just gorgeous, some of the best, best two holes in america. >>
 two years ago, we had a guy come and play my tournament for the first time, and
 instantly bought a lot and built a house within a year. I mean, it was just, he
 that impressed with the place. >> it's very challenging. I mean, some of the
 best golfers now playing the game have got their tour cards on this particular
 course and have lived to tell everyone that it's a very tough, challenging
 course. >> golf is not all this community has to offer. Waterwood is nestled

 livingston. >> the primary thing that makes waterwood so unique is that lake
 livingston is so quiet. Unlike other lakes, where you have horrendous boat
 traffic, there's hardly any boat traffic here, even on holidays. >> lake
 livingston is a fisherman's paradise. How do i know 450 well, first of all, i
 see the fishermen bringing the fish in, but ecologically-- and i'm an
 ecologist-- when you see birds that fish for a living, and that's the only way
 they can feed their families, and there are thousands of them and sometimes
 tens of thousands of them, and they're all big and fat and healthy, then you

 very low. You can compare it to any other part of the country, i think. It's
 hard to make a mistake buying property in this part of the world. >> lake
 conroe is pretty well saturated, and houston just keeps moving forward, keeps
 moving forward. And on lake livingston, waterwood is the premier place on lake

 > okay, here's a quick recap of the star trader system; there are five keys to
 the formula and five points to a star. Each point is assigned a subject
 pertaining to the stock we are interested in. Point one is fundamentals. Number
 is technical analysis. Number three is news. Point four is sentiment and that
 technique alone has made thousands of investors fantastic wealth, and the final
 is economy watch. Now remember we're going to grade each point subject on the
 star. If we average out to the plus side we are going to make money when the
 stock goes up. If it shows negative we are going to make money when the stock
 goes down. And if it's level, we will even make money when the stock goes
 sideways. It's really simple and you can use it over and over to consistently
 win in the market. > wouldn't it be great to be able to use the same knowledge

 presentation for red. 120 0 0 0 0 are you tired of constantly fighting that
 growing midsection or have you given up on those less-than-loveable love
 handles and flabby pooch area 0 endless crunches are uncomfortable and strain
 the neck and back, plus who really has time to go to the gym 0 you may have
 even considered expensive liposuction, costing thousands of dollars just to get
 shape. >> i fight the pooch. >> the pooch, the pouch-- i call it "the pouch."
 >> beer belly, whatever you want to call it... Buddha on your stomach, right in
 front. >> fat in the abdominal area is the hardest to work on. >> i hate to
 work out and i hate to do abs because it's painful. >> announcer: now slimming
 has come full circle. Introducing red, the first resistance exercise disc, the
 easiest and most comfortable way to strengthen and sculpt an amazing core and
 midsection. >> i lost three dress sizes. >> got my waist down six inches. >> i
 lost seven and a half inches off my waist. >> announcer: red's high-tech
 slenderizing secret... Rotates and twists the core and torso through a circular
 of motion. It tightens and tones muscles, all the way around your waistline in
 continuous, sweeping movements that are easy to do. Red's unique exercise
 focuses muscle sculpting resistance on your midsection, working out your
 stomach, abs and love handle obliques-- your entire problem area. >> i lost
 seven inches off my waist. >> i lost nine inches off my waist. And four and a
 half inches off my hips. >> announcer: that means red strengthens core muscles
 and pulls your torso inward, making a tighter, smaller circle, and that's what
 helps shrink inches off your waistline for real results. And red's torsion max
 resistance system packs a powerful punch. To intensify the burn, you select a
 desired resistance at your fingertips. As you turn, you'll feel your core
 working deeper and harder. Instantly, your workout becomes more challenging.
 you'll feel the burn faster where you need it to sculpt a slimmer, new you. >>

 so we designed red to be compact. It folds down and stores away in seconds, but
 is one serious machine-- engineered and rated to support up to 350 pounds. And
 red is quality. Its heavy-duty steel construction is built to last a lifetime.
 red's the most amazing way to sculpt lean, sexy abs while slimming your
 midsection. An independent review at the university of houston says, "red
 incorporates all of the muscles in the core region, plus the muscles of the
 lower back, quadriceps and even the upper body." what this means is you'll
 slim, strengthen and sculpt your core from every direction. Red's smooth,
 unique movement does it all. >> even though red is easy, it definitely gives
 you a workout. >> i didn't even know i had muscles like that. >> red works
 everything. >> i've lost weight everywhere. I've been amazed every day. >> this

 top fitness trainers have known about the core sculpting power of rotational
 exercises for years, but it's been hard to do until now. >> announcer: so what
 do fitness professionals think of red 0 we took it to some of america's finest
 trainers and exercise physiologists and asked for their opinions. >> i love
 red. It's done a lot for my back and neck, and it's helped my core strength
 tremendously. The results i've seen... Uh, with the people that have used red
 have been truly amazing. It's the best abdominal exerciser i have ever used. >>
 with red, you're getting all areas of the abs. You're getting the obliques,
 you're getting the upper ab, you get the lower ab, you're getting the whole
 central abdominal muscles, not just strictly isolating one small section like
 the old-fashioned ab crunchers where you're just coming straight forward and
 back down. So you basically get a full abdominal workout, hitting all areas of
 your ab muscles with red. >> well, we're raising our heart rate, we're helping
 to circulate and stimulate the blood flow. I think red would work for just
 about anyone. >> red is great for the lower abs, especially for women. Um, a
 lot of clients that i have who've had babies, this is great. It really gets
 deep in there, works the core muscles of the lower part of the abs. Red is
 easy. You'll get your results. >> i can definitely feel it in my abdominals,
 and i can also feel it in my arms. I work out all the time and i can feel this
 more than anything. Does it work 0 absolutely. >> the keys to rapid results are
 full range of motion and using resistance training. Red involves all of your
 core abdominal muscles to get that rich range of motion that delivers results.
 as you rotate on red, your abs and core muscles are being activated-- from the
 hips and back to obliques to center abs to obliques and then your back. That's
 360 degrees of core abdominal toning that's whittling down your waistline. >>
 gary: and when resistance is added to the formula, the results are
 unbelievable. >> before i started red, i was flabby and nasty. 360 laughs 360 i
 wear bulky clothes. After using red and losing the inches and the weight, i
 wear clothes that, you know, fit me, that show off my body and it got my waist
 down six inches. It's incredible. >> my stomach was huge. It was huge. It was,
 uh, just kind of disgusting. When i use red fitness, i, i can just feel it
 right... I can feel it and i know it's working. These results from using red
 fitness were great. >> why haven't exercise machines kept up with the times in
 terms of comfort 360 our car seats, our home and office furniture-- everything
 today is built to be comfortable except fitness machines. >> let's face it: a
 lot of exercise equipment isn't easy for bigger people to use. But red's padded
 foam seat cushion is extra wide and it's soft and comfy. When the exercise is
 easy on your body, you can concentrate on working out without distraction and
 without discomfort. >> announcer: so what do regular people think about red 360
 we took it to laguna beach, california to find out. >> this is cushiony, does
 not hurt your butt like sitting on a wood floor. >> you got a lot of "cush"...
 a cush for the tush. 360 laughs 360 >> you could sit here and watch tv while
 you do it. 360 laughs 360 >> wow, this feels great. I feel like it's working
 all of the right muscles. >> i'm feeling it here... And down lower, too. >> i'm
 to feel the burn. >> i'm feeling this burn here pretty fast doing this. >> man:
 it's working, i can feel it. >> you can feel 'em flexing and tightening right
 here in the front and then on the sides. >> i feel in my lower stomach. >> i
 feel it in my stomach. >> my stomach, right here. >> right here. >> right here.
 here. >> right here. >> right around, right around here. On the sides down
 here. >> i can definitely feel how it isolates the muscles. >> that lower, very
 ab. >> i really like it. It's good. >> it's very good. >> it's easy to do, it's
 i like it, it just feels good. >> you feel it all the way around your waist,
 you feel it down the front. 'cause you can tell i'm breathing. 360 laughs 360
 it's a good workout. >> i feel like this is going to get my six pack back. >>
 red's easy on your body and it's also easy to use. Your back remains straight
 and relaxed because the vertebrae in your back are in the ideal, relaxed
 neutral position. You grab hold of the handles which adjust to match your arm
 length, and now you just rotate right and left and right and left. At different
 in your rotation, different abs and core muscles are recruited, so by doing one
 rep, you tone and strengthen all your core muscles. You've toned your waistline
 the way around for that 360 360 degree toning. The key is you don't have to
 bend your back over to work the abs. You simply twist your torso to one side
 and then the other. Compare this to the crunches on one of those exercise
 balls. Those are so hard to use and to balance on. Even small, short twists
 like this are firing off ab muscles across the core and here in the center of
 the abs and across the abdomen. >> gary: make red your favorite color, like
 these women who take body slimming very seriously. 360 classical music
 playing... 360 >> many of the movements in dance do deal with circular
 movement. Our dancers have to have the same movement that red has so that the
 body can move forward, side, back and side. It elongates all the muscles around
 waistline and in the upper back and the, and the shoulders. >> i dance and work
 four to five times a week. Red is a very effective machine. I can feel it in my
 i can feel it in my core and the resistance that it takes is absolutely no
 effort on my spine or my neck. I think the results you would get with this
 machine would certainly be beneficial to a dancer because you're stretching and
 resistance at the same time that you're building strength and endurance. With
 red, this is very comfortable to do. I can put this in my den while my kids are
 and watch shows with them and do this workout. Red is deceiving 'cause if you
 just look at it, it looks like a stool. I... When i saw it, i said, "well,
 where is the machine 360 " and they said, "it's right there." and i said,
 "where 360 " and they said, "right there, that red... The red is the machine."
 and i said, "well, how does it work 360 " it and you go side to side," and it
 just didn't look like it would be difficult and it is not difficult, although
 it's effective. I can totally feel it. I do like red. I'm very excited about
 red, i think it's a great machine. I think that it's so small and it's easy to
 fit in your home. It won't take up room. I think... Mostly, i think the results
 i'm going to see are gonna be fantastic. >> most people stop using exercise
 equipment because they find working out uncomfortable. They get discouraged and
 but with red, we guarantee that it's the most comfortable workout that you may
 ever experience. There's no impact on the joints, and best of all, red's smooth
 works out your core abdominals thoroughly. You could be burning hundreds of
 calories and slimming down your midsection while watching your favorite tv
 show, and you won't have to crank up the sound because red is virtually silent,
 like those noisy treadmills and cardio bikes. Red is the comfortable way to
 slim down, and talking about slim, red does not take up an entire room like
 other bulky exercise equipment. Use it in the privacy of your bedroom or in the
 and when you're done, red stores under your bed in seconds. Red is that
 once-in-a-lifetime exercise machine that's comfortable and easy to use. It's a
 serious workout that's easy on your body. Red gets results. >> i lost seven and
 half inches off my waist in eight weeks. That's almost an inch a week. These
 are my old pants. And... They're huge 360 i used to... I fit in these eight
 weeks ago. This means more than a scale will ever mean, when you can grab your
 pants... And do that, and know that... They're huge. You can't wear them
 anymore. These are pretty dramatic results. The best part of this is when
 people notice. They say, "you've lost weight 360 " and that's so exciting to
 hear people say. >> i lost five and a half inches off my hips, nine inches off
 my waist, all that using red. And all that within two months. Nine inches
 around my waist is a huge accomplishment for me because before, it just, like,
 stayed there... I'll lose the weight, bigger on the waist. But now with red,
 that's gone. These pants used to fit fairly well. They were nice and
 comfortable. It looks like a clown outfit. Now, i can't even wear these
 anymore. I mean, it's huge... I mean, to the point where if i don't wear a
 belt, they pretty much, like, fall down to my ankle. And all this because of
 red. I'm ecstatic about it, actually. >> write down this phone number and call

 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the

 and five blocks to help the heat win a title and himself a first ring after
 overcoming a life-threatening kidney disease and transplant. >> the key to you
 recovering is keeping this right, keeping your mind right. Because if you keep
 this positive and strong, then your body is going to follow it. I never gave up
 here. I never gave up up here. And i think i credit a great deal of my recovery
 that, because i never gave up up here, because so many people are quick to give
 and say why me, why me 0 and not realizing there's a whole lot of people out
 there who have it a whole lot worse than you do. Everybody had has problems.
 everybody has problems. Regardless of how bad you have it, somebody else out
 there has it worse. Think about that. Sit back and think about that, you know 0
 that's what drives me. >> pillar of strength. Alonzo mourning. >> mark mulder
 hoping to continue his success against the white sox. He was 5 -1 career
 against them. Bottom three, white sox leading 2 -1 paul konerko. That will
 score tad iguchi. 3 -1 , white sox. And the flood gates are open. A.j.
 pierzynski. A three-run shot. His fourth of the year. And condition north
 america co, yeah he's up again. Singles to left. That will score pablo ozuna
 and iguchi. They score 11 in the inning, mulder down after 2 2 sidney ponson
 hits brian anderson. Next batter, pablo ozuna hit by ponson. He says the guys
 he hit ha v >> and you knew that was going to happen. Hits chris duncan. He
 gets tossed. Now remember last week, guillen went off on sean tracey who failed
 retaliate. Thinking twice about saying anything more. Heads back to clubhouse
 after being ejected. >> two on for howard. Look where this goes. Estimated at
 461 feet. It's the first to reach the third-deck level in the three-year
 history of citizens bank park. Howard goes opposite field. A two-run shot. His
 second of the day. 25 th of the year. Bottom fiv now, two on for howard. Down
 the right field lean. He'll drop it into third with a triple. Two runs score.
 he had a career high seven r.b.i. And the phils are on top 7 -5 top eight, here
 the yank, down a run. Runners on the corners. Johnny damon , right over aaron
 rowand. He'll drop into third with a triple. Miguel cairo and mel i can
 cabrera. 8 -7 yankees. Bottom nine, phils down two runs with two on. Howard
 facing marian owe rivera. And here's the drama. Howard, not going to happen
 this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording his first six-out save of
 the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >> together, they might form
 the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's not true, there's no
 arguing the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane wade combi x -7 0 0 0 h 0 >>
 pat riley said he would have traded in the first six rings he has for the one
 he got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he didn't have to. He adds to his
 >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0 this is your fourth ring. >> it's very
 sweet. My brother right here, i knew when i see him play that he was a special
 player. Once i cameere, i knew it was my job to take him to the next level. We
 developed his alter ego flash. He's very unselfish. I told him they're going to
 and triple team me and go on and do what you do and take over. >> dwyane, what
 was the first thing shaq said to you 0 he told miami he was here to win a
 championship. >> he call med and said i'm coming down there to win a
 championship. I'm not coming down there to mess around and be out on south
 beach. I'm coming to win a championship. He says we've got to have a talk, sit
 down man-to-man and have a talk. Once we did that, everything that happened in
 l.a. Wasn't going to happen in miami. He got my back, i got his back and that's
 way we always roll. >> this is the best team i've ever been on. >> why 0 >>
 i've been here two years. We've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i wasn't in
 either one of them. >> really 0.9 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i wasn't in
 any of them. And that's rare for me. That's rare for me. But this is a great
 team. We hinge out together, went to the movies together. Anytime anybody is at
 family function, everybody shows up. The family shows up, the kids show up. Pat
 did a great job of putting this team together. >> most people probably don't
 want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You have to. The
 relationship between kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal was absolutely terrible
 during the three championships. I think this one means more to him because he
 has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away, you have to understand, a
 is really a family. That's one thing pat riley emphasized. You heard him talk
 about what was in that pen. It's about family. When you have a family, you
 trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be the first to admit he made
 as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really not embracing kobe
 bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to miami and had
 dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He was smart
 enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to happen.
 and that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about how
 incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All three
 finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long time. I
 think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun scoring
 nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a. That
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.
 hadn't started because he had a yellow card. In the 34 th minute, the high
 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms -2 -2 dallas. Men of
 the square table, when toasting, do we clink tops or bottoms -2 let's just take
 look. Hmmm. If the tops touch, then our saliva is touching. Well, then
 technically that would qualify as a kiss. Oh, come on -2 tell you what, why
 don't we just touch bottoms. No, thanks, hollywood. I ain't into that. Bottles.
 law -2 -2 together -2 man law. The great taste of miller lite. Always a good
 call. >> gary payton will turn 38 years old next month. Didn't score much in
 this, his third nba finals. But every shot he hit seemed to be a gigantic one.
 after 16 years, g.p. Finally gets his jewelry, and he spoke with lisa salters
 after the game six clincher. >> gary, 16 seasons for you. What does this one
 feel like 16 >> feels great, feels real good. It came at the right time. I'm
 feeling really good about this. We have a good team. We just proved it to
 anybody. >> to come here, to win four straight, you hadn't won here all season
 long. >> well, just motivation and determination. We knew we were coming up in
 here. We knew we had them as the three games beating them in miami. We just had
 come in here and break their back and be scared. >> wheng you went down 0 -2 ,
 why didn't you guys think it was over. Because we're not that kind of
 basketball team. We're a team we want to always be on our back. We want
 everything to be against us. We came out and won four straight. Nobody thought
 we were going to do that. >> back to the diamond, adrian beltre returning to
 los angeles for the first time since he led the dodgers to the division title
 back in 2004 top one a two-run shot, his seventh of the season, fifth nont of
 june. He was 2 -3 in the mariners win. And ichiro, also extending his hit
 streak to 19 games. >> the angels won a championship at the expense of the
 giants four years ago. John lackey won game seven of the 2002 world series.
 lackey facing san francisco, and facing his counterpart, matt morris in a
 scoreless second inning. Morris delivering a two-run double. Morris allowed
 just one run. Giants win it 3 -2 they've won five straight over the halos. >>
 the last time pat riley coached a team to a championship, the miami heat didn't
 shaq was still in high school, d. Wade was 6 years old. >> cal state fullerton
 and top seed clemson. David cooper, the only freshman in the lineup went 35 -5
 , including that -5 -5 5 -5 , including that single. Fullerton upsets the top
 seed. >> the twins took a seven-game hit streak into houston. Minnesota with a
 5 -4 lead. Bottom nine, joe nathan in to close it out. Preston wilson wants to
 play a little longer. Solo shot. We're off to extras. Justin morneau, facing
 trever miller. And morneau just collected his 17 th home run. He has a career
 high 11 11 game hit streak. 19 r.b.i.'s during the streak. Minnesota climbs
 above 0.5 for the first time since tax day. 0.5 captioning made possible by
 espn, inc. 0.5 >> president pat riley reshaped the team, adding six new
 players. After being bashed for that and taking over the head coach heat, riley
 vindication as he leads miami to its first nba championship. >> and with that
 we welcome you inside the espnews room. With anthony amey, i'm michelle bonner.
 riley said he packed one suit, one shirt and one tie. He was not thinking or
 packing far game seven and he didn't need to. >> 18 years ago wednesday, riley
 won the last of his four nba championships as a head coach. Now he will
 commemorate the title as well as celebrating the heat's first in franchise
 history. >> who would have thought they would be back in dallas 18 mark cuban
 fined for what the commissioner termed several agents of misconduct. Dwyane
 wade and company ready to go, but not early. Dirk nowitzki, two of his 11
 first-quarter points. Dallas led by as many as 14 in the first quarter. Wade,
 going to work. He went scoreless the first 10 minutes of the game. Went off
 afterwards. 30 -23 , mavs after one. Second quarter, mavs by five. Gives it to
 terry. Later in the second, heat up one. Jason williams, one of his seven dipes
 his back to zo mourning. >> that was part of a 13 0 run. Tied at 53 -53
 mourning stuffs terry. Heat up nine. Mavericks out on the break. Marquis
 daniels came in with a total of five points in the series. Mavs down seven.
 fourth quarter, heat up three. Wade to shaq. He finished with nine points. Heat
 five. Sagana diop. Those are diop's only two points of the game. He would
 misthe free throw. The mavs are down three. Down five, terry, going to put it
 up. Mourning with five blocks in the game. Mavs down four. Jerry stackhouse
 back after being suspended for game five. Off glass. Dallas within two.
 three-point game now. Wade, with three defenders around him. James posey for
 three. Heat up six. It's a four-point game now. And stackhouse, from the corner
 he finished with 12 and the mavs are down one. Under 36 to go. Three-point
 game. Dirk nowitzki has two in the fourth. Beats erick dampier. He loses it.
 wade picks it up. Heat up three. 10.6 left. Wade at the line with a chance to
 ice it. Misses the first. Then misses the second. The heat would come up with
 the rebound, but traveling is called. So mavs with one last chance. Jason terry
 three. Rims out. Giving the heat their first title in franchise history.
 they're only the third team in nba history to walk with the title. That's a
 class act with mark cuban showing his appreciation. D. Wade, 36 points, the
 m.v.p. Of this series. >> what a finish to an amazing nba playoffs. >> i said
 it, and i mean it, i would give up six for this one. I would have. I would
 trade them all in for this one. Not disrespectful to any of them that i won,
 but after 18 years, and chasing, you know, combrow keep chasing it, you keep
 chasing it. You get tired. So this gives me a sense of absolute freedom. >> we
 came up short. We know they don't give any awards for coming in second, but we
 provided an awful lot for the whole city of dallas. >> obviously dwyane was
 great after game two or whatever. He was unstoppable. You know, he really won
 them the championship, you know 18 from game three, we were up 10 he just took
 over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put this
 team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong. Now,
 gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will, man,
 to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i came
 the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But i
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't

 people probably don't want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You

 i said it, and i mean it, i would give up six for this one. I would have. I
 would trade them all in for this one. Not disrespectful to any of them that i
 won, but after 18 years, and chasing, you know, combrow keep chasing it, you
 keep chasing it. You get tired. So this gives me a sense of absolute freedom.
 >> we came up short. We know they don't give any awards for coming in second,
 but we provided an awful lot for the whole city of dallas. >> obviously dwyane
 was great after game two or whatever. He was unstoppable. You know, he really
 won them the championship, you know 18 from game three, we were up 10 he just
 took over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put
 this team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong.
 they gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will,
 man, to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i
 to the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the

 gave up up here. And i think i credit a great deal of my recovery to that,
 because i never gave up up here, because so many people are quick to give up
 and say why me, why me 0 and not realizing there's a whole lot of people out
 there who have it a whole lot worse than you do. Everybody had has problems.
 everybody has problems. Regardless of how bad you have it, somebody else out
 there has it worse. Think about that. Sit back and think about that, you know 0
 that's what drives me. >> pillar of strength. Alonzo mourning. >> mark mulder
 hoping to continue his success against the white sox. He was 5 -1 career
 against them. Bottom three, white sox leading 2 -1 paul konerko. That will
 score tad iguchi. 3 -1 , white sox. And the flood gates are open. A.j.
 pierzynski. A three-run shot. His fourth of the year. And condition north
 america co, yeah he's up again. Singles to left. That will score pablo ozuna
 and iguchi. They score 11 in the inning, mulder down after 2 2 sidney ponson
 hits brian anderson. Next batter, pablo ozuna hit by ponson. He says the guys
 he hit ha v >> and you knew that was going to happen. Hits chris duncan. He
 gets tossed. Now remember last week, guillen went off on sean tracey who failed
 retaliate. Thinking twice about saying anything more. Heads back to clubhouse
 after being ejected. >> two on for howard. Look where this goes. Estimated at
 461 feet. It's the first to reach the third-deck level in the three-year
 history of citizens bank park. Howard goes opposite field. A two-run shot. His
 second of the day. 25 th of the year. Bottom five now, two on for howard. Down
 the right field lean. He'll drop it into third with a triple. Two runs score.
 he had a career high seven r.b.i. And the phils are on top 7 -5 top eight, here
 the yank, down a run. Runners on the corners. Johnny damon , right over aaron

 facing marian owe rivera. And here's the drama. Howard, not going to happen
 this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording his first six-out save of
 the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >> together, they might form
 the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's not true, there's no
 arguing the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane -7 hey, what's up, roger -7 -7

 rings he has for the one he got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he
 didn't have to. He adds to his collection. >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0
 this is your fourth ring. >> it's very sweet. My brother right here, i knew
 when i see him play that he was a special player. Once i came here, i knew it
 was my job to take him to the next level. We developed his alter ego flash.
 he's very unselfish. I told him they're going to double and triple team me and
 go on and do what you do and take over. >> dwyane, what was the first thing
 shaq said to you 0 he told miami he was here to win a championship. >> he call
 med and said i'm coming down there to win a championship. I'm not coming down
 there to mess around and be out on south beach. I'm coming to win a
 championship. He says we've got to have a talk, sit down man-to-man and have a
 talk. Once we did that, everything that happened in l.a. Wasn't going to happen
 miami. He got my back, i got his back and that's the way we always roll. >>
 this is the best team i've ever been on. >> why 0 >> i've been here two years.
 we've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i wasn't in either one of them. >> really
 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i wasn't in any of them. And that's rare for
 me. That's rare for me. But this is a great team. We hinge out together, went
 to the movies together. Anytime anybody is at a family function, everybody
 shows up. The family shows up, the kids show up. Pat riley did a great job of
 putting this team together. >> most people probably don't want to mention this,
 i'm going to bring it up. You have to. The relationship between kobe bryant and
 o'neal was absolutely terrible during the three championships. I think this one
 more to him because he has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away,
 you have to understand, a team is really a family. That's one thing pat riley
 emphasized. You heard him talk about what was in that pen. It's about family.
 when you have a family, you trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be
 first to admit he made as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really
 embracing kobe bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to
 miami and had dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He
 smart enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to
 happen. And that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about
 how incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All
 three finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long
 time. I think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun
 scoring nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a.
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.
 hadn't started because he had a yellow card. In the 34 th minute, the high
 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms where would you go

 every shot he hit seemed to be a gigantic one. After 16 years, g.p. Finally
 gets his jewelry, and he spoke with lisa salters after the game six clincher.

 straight, you hadn't won here all season long. >> well, just motivation and
 determination. We knew we were coming up in here. We knew we had them as the
 three games beating them in miami. We just had to come in here and break their
 back and be scared. >> wheng you went down 0 -2 , why didn't you guys think it
 was over. Because we're not that kind of basketball team. We're a team we want
 to always be on our back. We want everything to be against us. We came out and
 won four straight. Nobody thought we were going to do that. >> back to the
 diamond, adrian beltre returning to los angeles for the first time since he led
 dodgers to the division title back in 2004 top one a two-run shot, his seventh
 of the season, fifth nont of june. He was 2 -3 in the mariners win. And ichiro,
 extending his hit streak to 19 games. >> the angels won a championship at the
 expense of the giants four years ago. John lackey won game seven of the 2002
 world series. Lackey facing san francisco, and facing his counterpart, matt

 just one run. Giants win it 3 -2 they've won five straight over the halos. >>

 pat riley said he would have traded in the first six rings he has for the one
 he got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he didn't have to. He adds to his
 >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0 this is your fourth ring. >> it's very
 sweet. My brother right here, i knew when i see him play that he was a special
 player. Once i came here, i knew it was my job to take him to the next level.
 we developed his alter ego flash. He's very unselfish. I told him they're going
 double and triple team me and go on and do what you do and take over. >>
 dwyane, what was the first thing shaq said to you 0 he told miami he was here
 to win a championship. >> he call med and said i'm coming down there to win a
 championship. I'm not coming down there to mess around and be out on south
 beach. I'm coming to win a championship. He says we've got to have a talk, sit
 down man-to-man and have a talk. Once we did that, everything that happened in
 l.a. Wasn't going to happen in miami. He got my back, i got his back and that's
 way we always roll. >> this is the best team i've ever been on. >> why 0 >>
 i've been here two years. We've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i wasn't in
 either one of them. >> really 0.9 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i wasn't in
 any of them. And that's rare for me. That's rare for me. But this is a great
 team. We hinge out together, went to the movies together. Anytime anybody is at
 family function, everybody shows up. The family shows up, the kids show up. Pat
 did a great job of putting this team together. >> most people probably don't
 want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You have to. The
 relationship between kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal was absolutely terrible
 during the three championships. I think this one means more to him because he
 has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away, you have to understand, a
 is really a family. That's one thing pat riley emphasized. You heard him talk
 about what was in that pen. It's about family. When you have a family, you
 trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be the first to admit he made
 as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really not embracing kobe
 bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to miami and had
 dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He was smart
 enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to happen.
 and that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about how
 incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All three
 finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long time. I
 think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun scoring
 nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a. That
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether i be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.

 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms men of the square
 table, when toasting, do we clink tops or bottoms -2 let's just take a look.
 hmmm. If the tops touch, then our saliva is touching. Well, then technically
 that would qualify as a kiss. Oh, come on -2 tell you what, why don't we just

 years old next month. Didn't score much in this, his third nba finals. But
 every shot he hit seemed to be a gigantic one. After 16 years, g.p. Finally
 gets his jewelry, and he spoke with lisa salters after the game six clincher.
 >> gary, 16 seasons for you. What does this one feel like 16 >> feels great,
 feels real good. It came at the right time. I'm feeling really good about this.
 have a good team. We just proved it to anybody. >> to come here, to win four
 straight, you hadn't won here all season long. >> well, just motivation and
 determination. We knew we were coming up in here. We knew we had them as the
 three games beating them in miami. We just had to come in here and break their
 back and be scared. >> wheng you went down 0 -2 , why didn't you guys think it
 was over. Because we're not that kind of basketball team. We're a team we want
 to always be on our back. We want everything to be against us. We came out and
 won four straight. Nobody thought we were going to do that. >> back to the
 diamond, adrian beltre returning to los angeles for the first time since he led
 dodgers to the division title back in 2004 top one a two-run shot, his seventh
 of the season, fifth nont of june. He was 2 -3 in the mariners win. And ichiro,
 extending his hit streak to 19 games. >> the angels won a championship at the
 expense of the giants four years ago. John lackey won game seven of the 2002
 world series. Lackey facing san francisco, and facing his counterpart, matt
 morris in a scoreless second inning. Morris delivering a two-run double. Morris
 just one run. Giants win it 3 -2 they've won five straight over the halos. >>

 solo shot. We're off to extras. Justin morneau, facing trever miller. And
 morneau just collected his 17 th home run. He has a career high 11 11 game hit
 streak. 19 r.b.i.'s during the streak. Minnesota climbs above 0.5 for the first
 since tax day. 0.5 captioning made possible by espn, inc. 0.5 >> president pat
 riley reshaped the team, adding six new players. After being bashed for that
 and taking over the head coach heat, riley has vindication as he leads miami to
 first nba championship. >> and with that we welcome you inside the espnews
 room. With anthony amey, i'm michelle bonner. Pat riley said he packed one
 suit, one shirt and one tie. He was not thinking or packing far game seven and
 he didn't need to. >> 18 years ago wednesday, riley won the last of his four
 nba championships as a head coach. Now he will commemorate the title as well as
 the heat's first in franchise history. >> who would have thought they would be
 back in dallas 18 mark cuban fined for what the commissioner termed several
 agents of misconduct. Dwyane wade and company ready to go, but not early. Dirk
 nowitzki, two of his 11 first-quarter points. Dallas led by as many as 14 in
 the first quarter. Wade, going to work. He went scoreless the first 10 minutes
 of the game. Went off afterwards. 30 -23 , mavs after one. Second quarter, mavs
 five. Gives it to terry. Later in the second, heat up one. Jason williams, one
 of his seven dipes behind his back to zo mourning. >> that was part of a 13 0
 run. Tied at 53 -53 mourning stuffs terry. Heat up nine. Mavericks out on the
 break. Marquis daniels came in with a total of five points in the series. Mavs
 down seven. Fourth quarter, heat up three. Wade to shaq. He finished with nine
 points. Heat up five. Sagana diop. Those are diop's only two points of the
 game. He would misthe free throw. The mavs are down three. Down five, terry,
 going to put it up. Mourning with five blocks in the game. Mavs down four.
 jerry stackhouse back after being suspended for game five. Off glass. Dallas
 within two. Three-point game now. Wade, with three defenders around him. James
 posey for three. Heat up six. It's a four-point game now. And stackhouse, from
 the corner pocket, he finished with 12 and the mavs are down one. Under 36 to
 go. Three-point game. Dirk nowitzki has two in the fourth. Beats erick dampier.
 loses it. Wade picks it up. Heat up three. 10.6 left. Wade at the line with a
 chance to ice it. Misses the first. Then misses the second. The heat would come
 with the rebound, but traveling is called. So mavs with one last chance. Jason
 terry for three. Rims out. Giving the heat their first title in franchise
 history. They're only the third team in nba history to walk with the title.
 that's a class act with mark cuban showing his appreciation. D. Wade, 36
 points, the m.v.p. Of this series. >> what a finish to an amazing nba playoffs.
 i said it, and i mean it, i would give up six for this one. I would have. I
 would trade them all in for this one. Not disrespectful to any of them that i
 won, but after 18 years, and chasing, you know, combrow keep chasing it, you
 keep chasing it. You get tired. So this gives me a sense of absolute freedom.
 >> we came up short. We know they don't give any awards for coming in second,
 but we provided an awful lot for the whole city of dallas. >> obviously dwyane
 was great after game two or whatever. He was unstoppable. You know, he really
 won them the championship, you know 18 from game three, we were up 10 he just
 took over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put
 this team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong.
 they gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will,
 man, to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i
 to the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the
 cardinals, ozzie guillen was getting socked. Ryan howard socked one out. And
 another. How he got his fill of the yankees. Sweden trying to stretch out an

 with the mango salsa. I don't have much of an appetite, thank you. Geico. 15
 minutes could save you 15 15 or more on car insurance. 15 15 >> turnover, terry
 the blocked by mourning, does it again 15 >> alonzo mourning comes up with
 eight points, six boards and five blocks to help the heat win a title and
 himself a first ring after overcoming a life-threatening kidney disease and
 transplant. >> the key to you recovering is keeping this right, keeping your
 mind right. Because if you keep this positive and strong, then your body is
 going to follow it. I never gave up up here. I never gave up up here. And i
 think i credit a great deal of my recovery to that, because i never gave up up
 here, because so many people are quick to give up and say why me, why me 15 and
 realizing there's a whole lot of people out there who have it a whole lot worse
 you do. Everybody had has problems. Everybody has problems. Regardless of how
 bad you have it, somebody else out there has it worse. Think about that. Sit
 back and think about that, you know 15 and that's what drives me. >> pillar of
 strength. Alonzo mourning. >> mark mulder hoping to continue his success
 against the white sox. He was 5 -1 career against them. Bottom three, white sox
 2 -1 paul konerko. That will score tad iguchi. 3 -1 , white sox. And the flood
 gates are open. A.j. Pierzynski. A three-run shot. His fourth of the year. And
 condition north america co, yeah he's up again. Singles to left. That will
 score pablo ozuna and iguchi. They score 11 in the inning, mulder down after 2

 howard facing marian owe rivera. And here's the drama. Howard, not going to
 happen this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording his first six-out
 save of the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >> together, they
 might form the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's not true,
 there's no arguing the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane wa x -7 0 0 0 h 0
 >> pat riley said he would have traded in the first six rings he has for the
 one he got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he didn't have to. He adds to
 collection. >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0 this is your fourth ring. >>
 it's very sweet. My brother right here, i knew when i see him play that he was
 a special player. Once i came here, i knew it was my job to take him to the
 next level. We developed his alter ego flash. He's very unselfish. I told him
 they're going to double and triple team me and go on and do what you do and
 take over. >> dwyane, what was the first thing shaq said to you 0 he told miami
 was here to win a championship. >> he call med and said i'm coming down there
 to win a championship. I'm not coming down there to mess around and be out on
 south beach. I'm coming to win a championship. He says we've got to have a
 talk, sit down man-to-man and have a talk. Once we did that, everything that
 happened in l.a. Wasn't going to happen in miami. He got my back, i got his
 back and that's the way we always roll. >> this is the best team i've ever been
 >> why 0 >> i've been here two years. We've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i
 wasn't in either one of them. >> really 0.9 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i
 wasn't in any of them. And that's rare for me. That's rare for me. But this is
 a great team. We hinge out together, went to the movies together. Anytime
 anybody is at a family function, everybody shows up. The family shows up, the
 kids show up. Pat riley did a great job of putting this team together. >> most
 people probably don't want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You
 have to. The relationship between kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal was
 absolutely terrible during the three championships. I think this one means more
 him because he has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away, you have
 to understand, a team is really a family. That's one thing pat riley
 emphasized. You heard him talk about what was in that pen. It's about family.
 when you have a family, you trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be
 first to admit he made as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really
 embracing kobe bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to
 miami and had dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He
 smart enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to
 happen. And that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about
 how incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All
 three finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long
 time. I think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun
 scoring nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a.
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports

 took over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put
 this team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong.
 they gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will,
 man, to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i
 to the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the
 cardinals, ozzie guillen was getting socked. Ryan howard socked one out. And
 another. How he got his fill of the yankees. Sweden trying to stretch out an
 impressive streak against england. Go for a delicious panini hot off the grill
 18 how about your microwave 18 try a corner bistro panini from stouffer's.
 cooked on a revolutionary grilling tray, they're the only panini that actually
 grill to perfection... In your microwave. For a crispy, restaurant-inspired
 panini at home. Try our full menu of corner bistro panini... And see what's
 cooking at stouffer's. 18 18 >> turnover, terry gets the blocked by mourning,
 does it again 18 >> alonzo mourning comes up with eight points, six boards and
 five blocks to help the heat win a title and himself a first ring after
 overcoming a life-threatening kidney disease and transplant. >> the key to you
 recovering is keeping this right, keeping your mind right. Because if you keep
 this positive and strong, then your body is going to follow it. I never gave up
 here. I never gave up up here. And i think i credit a great deal of my recovery
 that, because i never gave up up here, because so many people are quick to give
 and say why me, why me 18 and not realizing there's a whole lot of people out
 there who have it a whole lot worse than you do. Everybody had has problems.
 everybody has probls. Regardless of how bad you have it, somebody else out
 there has it worse. Think about that. Sit back and think about that, you know
 18 and that's what drives me. >> pillar of strength. Alonzo mourning. >> mark
 mulder hoping to continue his success against the white sox. He was 5 -1 career
 them. Bottom three, white sox leading 2 -1 paul konerko. That will score tad
 iguchi. 3 -1 , white sox. And the flood gates are open. A.j. Pierzynski. A
 three-run shot. His fourth of the year. And condition north america co, yeah
 he's up again. Singles to left. That will score pablo ozuna and iguchi. They
 score 11 in the inning, mulder down after 2 2 sidney ponson hits brian
 anderson. Next batter, pablo ozuna hit by ponson. He says the guys he hit ha v
 >> and you knew that was going to hpen. Hits chris duncan. He gets tossed. Now
 remember last week, guillen went off on sean tracey who failed to retaliate.
 thinking twice about saying anything more. Heads back to clubhouse after being
 ejected. >> two on for howard. Look where this goes. Estimated at 461 feet.
 it's the first to reach the third-deck level in the three-year history of
 citizens bank park. Howard goes opposite field. A two-run shot. His second of
 the day. 25 th of the year. Bottom five now, two on for howard. Down the right
 field lean. He'll drop it into third with a triple. Two runs score. He had a
 career high seven r.b.i. And the phils are on top 7 -5 top eight, here come the
 down a run. Runners on the corners. Johnny damon , right over aaron rowand.
 he'll drop into third with a triple. Miguel cairo and mel i can cabrera. 8 -7
 yankees. Bottom nine, phils down two runs with two on. Howard facing marian owe
 and here's the drama. Howard, not going to happen this time. Ground out to
 second. Rivera, recording his first six-out save of the season as the yankees
 end a three-game slide. >> together, they might form the most unstoppable duo
 in the nba. Even if that's not true, there's no arguing the results. Shaquille
 o'neal and dwyane wa -7 hey, what's up, roger -7 -7 hey, stu. What's up -7 hey,
 supplier gave me these. And i figured if anybody could use them, you could. Oh
 yeah, that's nice. Thanks. Uh, i don't know if they're any good or not. -7
 they'll be all right. -7 yeah, yeah, but you might want to check them. Okay.
 all right. -7 laughing -7 yeah. It's funny, huh -7 real funny. X -7 0 0 0 h 0
 >> pat riley said he would have traded in the first six rings he has for the
 one he got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he didn't have to. He adds to
 collection. >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0 this is your fourth ring. >>
 it's very sweet. My brother right here, i knew when i see him play that he was
 a special player. Once i came here, i knew it was my job to take him to the
 next level. We developed his alter ego flash. He's very unselfish. I told him
 they're going to double and triple team me and go on and do what you do and
 take over. >> dwyane, what was the first thing shaq said to you 0 he told miami
 was here to win a championship. >> he call med and said i'm coming down there
 to win a championship. I'm not coming down there to mess around and be out on
 south beach. I'm coming to win a championship. He says we've got to have a
 talk, sit down man-to-man and have a talk. Once we did that, everything that
 happened in l.a. Wasn't going to happen in miami. He got my back, i got his
 back and that's the way we always roll. >> this is the best team i've ever been
 >> why 0 >> i've been here two years. We've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i
 wasn't in either one of them. >> really 0.9 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i
 wasn't in any of them. And that's rare for me. That's rare for me. But this is
 a great team. We hinge out together, went to the movies together. Anytime
 anybody is at a family function, everybody shows up. The family shows up, the
 kids show up. Pat riley did a great job of putting this team together. >> most
 people probably don't want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You
 have to. The relationship between kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal was
 absolutely terrible during the three championships. I think this one means more
 him because he has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away, you have
 to understand, a team is really a family. That's one thing pat riley
 emphasized. You heard him talk about what was in that pen. It's about family.
 when you have a family, you trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be
 first to admit he made as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really
 embracing kobe bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to
 miami and had dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He
 smart enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to
 happen. And that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about
 how incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All
 three finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long
 time. I think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun
 scoring nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a.
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.
 hadn't started because he had a yellow card. In the 34 th minute, the high
 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms go go go -2 yes -2
 hey let's order a pizza. Make it a thin crust. You got it -2 -2 sfx: phone
 rings -2 hello -2 ya, we'd like a large thin crust pizza. Ralph -2 exactly...
 and you know what, make it the way i like it. Loaded with mozzarella and
 toppings. You know i hate when you do this. Wonderful -2 another thing, make it
 because we're starving -2 right boys -2 ralph... Chop chop -2 for fresh-baked
 pizza today... It's not delivery. It's digiorno. Hey great pizza, ralphie. Who
 delivered -2 that would be me -2 >> gary payton will turn 38 years old next
 month. Didn't score much in this, his third nba finals. But every shot he hit
 seemed to be a gigantic one. After 16 years, g.p. Finally gets his jewelry, and
 spoke with lisa salters after the game six clincher. >> gary, 16 seasons for
 you. What does this one feel like 16 >> feels great, feels real good. It came
 at the right time. I'm feeling really good about this. We have a good team. We
 just proved it to anybody. >> to come here, to win four straight, you hadn't
 won here all season long. >> well, just motivation and determination. We knew
 we were coming up in here. We knew we had them as the three games beating them
 in miami. We just had to come in here and break their back and be scared. >>
 wheng you went down 0 -2 , why didn't you guys think it was over. Because we're
 that kind of basketball team. We're a team we want to always be on our back. We
 everything to be against us. We came out and won four straight. Nobody thought
 we were going to do that. >> back to the diamond, adrian beltre returning to
 los angeles for the first time since he led the dodgers to the division title
 back in 2004 top one a two-run shot, his seventh of the season, fifth nont of
 june. He was 2 -3 in the mariners win. And ichiro, also extending his hit
 streak to 19 games. >> the angels won a championship at the expense of the
 giants four years ago. John lackey won game seven of the 2002 world series.
 lackey facing san francisco, and facing his counterpart, matt morris in a
 scoreless second inning. Morris delivering a two-run double. Morris allowed
 just one run. Giants win it 3 -2 they've won five straight over the halos. >>
 the last time pat riley coached a team to a championship, the miami heat didn't
 shaq was still in high school, d. Wade was 6 years old. Men of the square
 table, when toasting, do we clink tops or bottoms 6 let's just take a look.
 hmmm. If the tops touch, then our saliva is touching. Well, then technically
 that would qualify as a kiss. Oh, come on 6 tell you what, why don't we just
 touch bottoms. No, thanks, hollywood. I ain't into that. Bottles. Man law 6 6
 together 6 man law. The great taste of miller lite. Always a good call. W. 6 x
 >> cal state fullerton and top seed clemson. David cooper, the only freshman in
 lineup went 35 -5 , including that -5 -5 5 -5 , including that single.
 fullerton upsets the top seed. >> the twins took a seven-game hit streak into
 houston. Minnesota with a 5 -4 lead. Bottom nine, joe nathan in to close it
 out. Preston wilson wants to play a little longer. Solo shot. We're off to
 extras. Justin morneau, facing trever miller. And morneau just collected his 17
 home run. He has a career high 11 11 game hit streak. 19 r.b.i.'s during the
 streak. Minnesota climbs above 0.5 for the first time since tax day. 0.5
 captioning made possible by espn, inc. 0.5 >> president pat riley reshaped the
 team, adding six new players. After being bashed for that and taking over the
 head coach heat, riley has vindication as he leads miami to its first nba
 championship. >> and with that we welcome you inside the espnews room. With
 anthony amey, i'm michelle bonner. Pat riley said he packed one suit, one shirt
 one tie. He was not thinking or packing far game seven and he didn't need to.
 >> 18 years ago wednesday, riley won the last of his four nba championships as
 a head coach. Now he will commemorate the title as well as celebrating the
 heat's first in franchise history. >> who would have thought they would be back
 dallas 18 mark cuban fined for what the commissioner termed several agents of
 misconduct. Dwyane wade and company ready to go, but not early. Dirk nowitzki,
 two of his 11 first-quarter points. Dallas led by as many as 14 in the first
 quarter. Wade, going to work. He went scorelesshe first 10 minutes of the game.
 off afterwards. 30 -23 , mavs after one. Second quarter, mavs by five. Gives it
 terry. Later in the second, heat up one. Jason williams, one of his seven dipes
 his back to zo mourning. >> that was part of a 13 0 run. Tied at 53 -53
 mourning stuffs terry. Heat up nine. Mavericks out on the break. Marquis
 daniels came in with a total of five points in the series. Mavs down seven.
 fourth quarter, heat up three. Wade to shaq. He finished with nine points. Heat
 five. Sagana diop. Those are diop's only two points of the game. He would
 misthe free throw. The mavs are down three. Down five, terry, going to put it
 up. Mourning with five blocks in the game. Mavs down four. Jerry stackhouse
 back after being suspended for game five. Off glass. Dallas within two.
 three-point game now. Wade, with three defenders around him. James posey for
 three. Heat up six. It's a four-point game now. And stackhouse, from the corner
 he finished with 12 and the mavs are down one. Under 36 to go. Three-point
 game. Dirk nowitzki has two in the fourth. Beats erick dampier. He loses it.
 wade picks it up. Heat up three. 10.6 left. Wade at the line with a chance to
 ice it. Misses the first. Then misses the second. The heat would come up with
 the rebound, but traveling is called. So mavs with one last chance. Jason terry
 three. Rims out. Giving the heat their first title in franchise history.
 they're only the third team in nba history to walk with the title. That's a
 class act with mark cuban showing his appreciation. D. Wade, 36 points, the
 m.v.p. Of this series. >> what a finish to an amazing nba playoffs. >> i said
 it, and i mean it, i would give up six for this one. I would have. I would
 trade them all in for this one. Not disrespectful to any of them that i won,
 but after 18 years, and chasing, you know, combrow keep chasing it, you keep
 chasing it. You get tired. So this gives me a sense of absolute freedom. >> we
 came up short. We know they don't give any awards for coming in second, but we
 provided an awful lot for the whole city of dallas. >> obviously dwyane was
 great after game two or whatever. He was unstoppable. You know, he really won
 them the championship, you know 18 from game three, we were up 10 he just took
 over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put this
 team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong. Now,
 gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will, man,
 to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i came
 the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But i
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's

 at the right time. I'm feeling really good about this. We have a good team. We
 just proved it to anybody. >> to come here, to win four straight, you hadn't
 won here all season long. >> well, just motivation and determination. We knew
 we were coming up in here. We knew we had them as the three games beating them
 in miami. We just had to come in here and break their back and be scared. >>
 wheng you went down 0 -2 , why didn't you guys think it was over. Because we're
 that kind of basketball team. We're a team we want to always be on our back. We
 everything to be against us. We came out and won four straight. Nobody thought
 we were going to do that. >> back to the diamond, adrian beltre returning to
 los angeles for the first time since he led the dodgers to the division title

 june. He was 2 -3 in the mariners win. And ichiro, also extending his hit
 streak to 19 games. >> the angels won a championship at the expense of the
 giants four years ago. John lackey won game seven of the 2002 world series.
 lackey facing san francisco, and facing his counterpart, matt morris in a
 scoreless second inning. Morris delivering a two-run double. Morris allowed
 just one run. Giants win it 3 -2 they've won five straight over the halos. >>
 the last time pat riley coached a team to a championship, the miami heat didn't
 shaq was still in high school, d. Wade was 6 years old. Go go go 6 yes 6 hey
 let's order a pizza. Make it a thin crust. You got it 6 6 sfx: phone rings 6

 including that single. Fullerton upsets the top seed. >> the twins took a
 seven-game hit streak into houston. Minnesota with a 5 -4 lead. Bottom nine,
 joe nathan in to close it out. Preston wilson wants to play a little longer.
 solo shot. We're off to extras. Justin morneau, facing trever miller. And
 morneau just collected his 17 th home run. He has a career high 11 11 game hit
 streak. 19 r.b.i.'s during the streak. Minnesota climbs above 0.5 for the first
 since tax day. 0.5 captioning made possible by espn, inc. 0.5 >> president pat
 riley reshaped the team, adding six new players. After being bashed for that
 and taking over the head coach heat, riley has vindication as he leads miami to
 first nba championship. >> and with that we welcome you inside the espnews
 room. With anthony amey, i'm michelle bonner. Pat riley said he packed one
 suit, one shirt and one tie. He was not thinking or packing far game seven and
 he didn't need to. >> 18 years ago wednesday, riley won the last of his four
 nba championships as a head coach. Now he will commemorate the title as well as
 the heat's first in franchise history. >> who would have thought they would be
 back in dallas 18 mark cuban fined for what the commissioner termed several
 agents of misconduct. Dwyane wade and company ready to go, but not early. Dirk
 nowitzki, two of his 11 first-quarter points. Dallas led by as many as 14 in
 the first quarter. Wade, going to work. He went scoreless the first 10 minutes
 of the game. Went off afterwards. 30 -23 , mavs after one. Second quarter, mavs
 five. Gives it to terry. Later in the second, heat up one. Jason williams, one
 of his seven dipes behind his back to zo mourning. >> that was part of a 13 0
 run. Tied at 53 -53 mourning stuffs terry. Heat up nine. Mavericks out on the
 break. Marquis daniels came in with a total of five points in the series. Mavs
 down seven. Fourth quarter, heat up three. Wade to shaq. He finished with nine
 points. Heat up five. Sagana diop. Those are diop's only two points of the
 game. He would misthe free throw. The mavs are down three. Down five, terry,
 going to put it up. Mourning with five blocks in the game. Mavs down four.
 jerry stackhouse back after being suspended for game five. Off glass. Dallas
 within two. Three-point game now. Wade, with three defenders around him. James

 loses it. Wade picks it up. Heat up three. 10.6 left. Wade at the line with a
 chance to ice it. Misses the first. Then misses the second. The heat would come
 with the rebound, but traveling is called. So mavs with one last chance. Jason
 terry for three. Rims out. Giving the heat their first title in franchise
 history. They're only the third team in nba history to walk with the title.
 that's a class act with mark cuban showing his appreciation. D. Wade, 36
 points, the m.v.p. Of this series. >> what a finish to an amazing nba playoffs.
 i said it, and i mean it, i would give up six for this one. I would have. I
 would trade them all in for this one. Not disrespectful to any of them that i
 won, but after 18 years, and chasing, you know, combrow keep chasing it, you
 keep chasing it. You get tired. So this gives me a sense of absolute freedom.
 >> we came up short. We know they don't give any awards for coming in second,
 but we provided an awful lot for the whole city of dallas. >> obviously dwyane
 was great after game two or whatever. He was unstoppable. You know, he really
 won them the championship, you know 18 from game three, we were up 10 he just
 took over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put
 this team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong.
 they gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will,
 man, to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i
 to the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the
 cardinals, ozzie guillen was getting socked. Ryan howard socked one out. And
 another. How he got his fill of the yankees. Sweden trying to stretch out an
 impressive streak against england. Here's to men... To guys who want to take
 longer drives... With fewer pit stops. To guys who want to spend less time in
 the men's room... And more time fishing. And here's to flomax. It's approved to
 male urinary symptoms due to bph, also called an enlarged prostate. In one
 week, flomax may help symptoms like going often... Going urgently...weak
 stream... Frequently waking up at night to go. For you, flomax could make a
 difference in one week. Ask your doctor if symptoms are from bph, not prostate
 cancer. Common side effects of flomax are runny nose, dizziness and decrease in
 upon standing, a sudden decrease in blood pressure may occur, rarely resulting
 in fainting. So when starting flomax, avoid situations where injury could
 result. For more information, call 877 -4 -4 flomax. Ask your doctor about
 flomax. Flomax could make a difference in one week. -4 -4 >> turnover, terry
 gets the blocked by mourning, does it again -4 >> alonzo mourning comes up with
 points, six boards and five blocks to help the heat win a title and himself a
 first ring after overcoming a life-threatening kidney disease and transplant.
 >> the key to you recovering is keeping this right, keeping your mind right.
 because if you keep this positive and strong, then your body is going to follow
 i never gave up up here. I never gave up up here. And i think i credit a great
 deal of my recovery to that, because i never gave up up here, because so many
 people are quick to give up and say why me, why me -4 and not realizing there's
 whole lot of people out there who have it a whole lot worse than you do.
 everybody had has problems. Everybody has problems. Regardless of how bad you
 have it, somebody else out there has it worse. Think about that. Sit back and
 think about that, you know -4 and that's what drives me. >> pillar of strength.
 mourning. >> mark mulder hoping to continue his success against the white sox.
 he was 5 -1 career against them. Bottom three, white sox leading 2 -1 paul
 konerko. That will score tad iguchi. 3 -1 , white sox. And the flood gates are
 open. A.j. Pierzynski. A three-run shot. His fourth of the year. And condition
 north america co, yeah he's up again. Singles to left. That will score pablo
 ozuna and iguchi. They score 11 in the inning, mulder down after 2 2 sidney
 ponson hits brian anderson. Next batter, pablo ozuna hit by ponson. He says the
 he hit ha v >> and you knew that was going to happen. Hits chris duncan. He
 gets tossed. Now remember last week, guillen went off on sean tracey who failed
 retaliate. Thinking twice about saying anything more. Heads back to clubhouse
 after being ejected. >> two on for howard. Look where this goes. Estimated at
 461 feet. It's the first to reach the third-deck level in the three-year
 history of citizens bank park. Howard goes opposite field. A two-run shot. His
 second of the day. 25 th of the year. Bottom five now, two on for howard. Down
 the right field lean. He'll drop it into third with a triple. Two runs score.
 he had a career high seven r.b.i. And the phils are on top 7 -5 top eight, here
 the yank, down a run. Runners on the corners. Johnny damon , right over aaron
 rowand. He'll drop into third with a triple. Miguel cairo and mel i can
 cabrera. 8 -7 yankees. Bottom nine, phils down two runs with two on. Howard
 facing marian owe rivera. And here's the drama. Howard, not going to happen
 this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording his first six-out save of
 the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >> together, they might form
 the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's not true, ere's no arguing
 the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane x -7 0 0 0 h 0 >> pat riley said he
 would have traded in the first six rings he has for the one he got on tuesday.
 thanks to shaq and d. Wade he didn't have to. He adds to his collection. >>
 shaq, how sweet does this feel 0 this is your fourth ring. >> it's very sweet.
 my brother right here, i knew when i see him play that he was a special player.
 i came here, i knew it was my job to take him to the next level. We developed
 his alter ego flash. He's very unselfish. I told him they're going to double
 and triple team me and go on and do what you do and take over. >> dwyane, what
 was the first thing shaq said to you 0 he told miami he was here to win a
 championship. >> he call med and said i'm coming down there to win a
 championship. I'm not coming down there to mess around and be out on south
 beach. I'm coming to win a championship. He says we've got to have a talk, sit
 down man-to-man and have a talk. Once we did that, everything that happened in
 l.a. Wasn't going to happen in miami. He got my back, i got his back and that's
 way we always roll. >> this is the best team i've ever been on. >> why 0 >>
 i've been here two years. We've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i wasn't in
 either one of them. >> really 0.9 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i wasn't in
 any of them. And that's rare for me. That's rare for me. But this is a great
 team. We hinge out together, went to the movies together. Anytime anybody is at
 family function, everybody shows up. The family shows up, the kids show up. Pat
 did a great job of putting this team together. >> most people probably don't
 want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You have to. The
 relationship between kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal was absolutely terrible
 during the three championships. I think this one means more to him because he
 has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away, you have to understand, a
 is really a family. That's one thing pat riley emphasized. You heard him talk
 about what was in that pen. It's about family. When you have a family, you
 trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be the first to admit he made
 as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really not embracing kobe
 bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to miami and had
 dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He was smart
 enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to happen.
 and that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about how
 incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All three
 finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long time. I
 think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun scoring
 nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a. That
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.
 hadn't started because he had a yellow card. In the 34 th minute, the high
 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms -2 hey, what's up,
 roger -2 -2 hey, stu. What's up -2 hey, a supplier gave me these. And i figured
 anybody could use them, you could. Oh yeah, that's nice. Thanks. Uh, i don't
 know if they're any good or not. -2 they'll be all right. -2 yeah, yeah, but
 you might want to check them. Okay. All right. -2 laughing -2 yeah. It's funny,
 -2 real funny. Where would you go for a delicious panini hot off the grill -2
 how about your microwave -2 try a corner bistro panini from stouffer's. Cooked
 on a revolutionary grilling tray, they're the only panini that actually grill
 to perfection... In your microwave. For a crispy, restaurant-inspired panini at
 try our full menu of corner bistro panini... And see what's cooking at
 stouffer's. >> gary payton will turn 38 years old next month. Didn't score much
 this, his third nba finals. But every shot he hit seemed to be a gigantic one.
 after 16 years, g.p. Finally gets his jewelry, and he spoke with lisa salters
 after the game six clincher. >> gary, 16 seasons for you. What does this one
 feel like 16 >> feels great, feels real good. It came at the right time. I'm
 feeling really good about this. We have a good team. We just proved it to
 anybody. >> to come here, to win four straight, you hadn't won here all season
 long. >> well, just motivation and determination. We knew we were coming up in
 here. We knew we had them as the three games beating them in miami. We just had
 come in here and break their back and be scared. >> wheng you went down 0 -2 ,
 why didn't you guys think it was over. Because we're not that kind of
 basketball team. We're a team we want to always be on our back. We want
 everything to be against us. We came out and won four straight. Nobody thought
 we were going to do that. >> back to the diamond, adrian beltre returning to
 los angeles for the first time since he led the dodgers to the division title
 back in 2004 top one a two-run shot, his seventh of the season, fifth nont of
 june. He was 2 -3 in the mariners win. And ichiro, also extending his hit

 scoreless second inning. Morris delivering a two-run double. Morris allowed
 just one run. Giants win it 3 -2 they've won five straight over the halos. >>

 the right field lean. He'll drop it into third with a triple. Two runs score.
 he had a career high seven r.b.i. And the phils are on top 7 -5 top eight, here

 rowand. He'll drop into third with a triple. Miguel cairo and mel i can
 cabrera. 8 -7 yankees. Bottom nine, phils down two runs with two on. Howard
 facing marian owe rivera. And here's the drama. Howard, not going to happen
 this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording his first six-out save of
 the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >> together, they might form
 the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's not true, there's no
 arguing the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane wade x -7 0 0 0 h 0 >> pat
 riley said he would have traded in the first six rings he has for the one he
 got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he didn't have to. He adds to his
 collection. >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0 this is your fourth ring. >>
 it's very sweet. My brother right here, i knew when i see him play that he was
 a special player. Once i came here, i knew it was my job to take him to the
 next level. We developed his alter ego flash. He's very unselfish. I told him
 they're going to double and triple team me and go on and do what you do and
 take over. >> dwyane, what was the first thing shaq said to you 0 he told miami
 was here to win a championship. >> he call med and said i'm coming down there
 to win a championship. I'm not coming down there to mess around and be out on
 south beach. I'm coming to win a championship. He says we've got to have a
 talk, sit down man-to-man and have a talk. Once we did that, everything that
 happened in l.a. Wasn't going to happen in miami. He got my back, i got his
 back and that's the way we always roll. >> this is the best team i've ever been
 >> why 0 >> i've been here two years. We've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i
 wasn't in either one of them. >> really 0.9 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i
 wasn't in any of them. And that's rare for me. That's rare for me. But this is
 a great team. We hinge out together, went to the movies together. Anytime
 anybody is at a family function, everybody shows up. The family shows up, the
 kids show up. Pat riley did a great job of putting this team together. >> most
 people probably don't want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You
 have to. The relationship between kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal was
 absolutely terrible during the three championships. I think this one means more
 him because he has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away, you have
 to understand, a team is really a family. That's one thing pat riley
 emphasized. You heard him talk about what was in that pen. It's about family.
 when you have a family, you trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be
 first to admit he made as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really
 embracing kobe bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to
 miami and had dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He
 smart enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to
 happen. And that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about
 how incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All
 three finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long
 time. I think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun
 scoring nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a.
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.
 hadn't started because he had a yellow card. In the 34 th minute, the high
 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms -2 -2 dallas. >> gary
 will turn 38 years old next month. Didn't score much in this, his third nba
 finals. But every shot he hit seemed to be a gigantic one. After 16 years, g.p.
 gets his jewelry, and he spoke with lisa salters after the game six clincher.
 >> gary, 16 seasons for you. What does this one feel like 16 >> feels great,
 feels real good. It came at the right time. I'm feeling really good about this.
 have a good team. We just proved it to anybody. >> to come here, to win four
 straight, you hadn't won here all season long. >> well, just motivation and
 determination. We knew we were coming up in here. We knew we had them as the
 three games beating them in miami. We just had to come in here and break their
 back and be scared. >> wheng you went down 0 -2 , why didn't you guys think it
 was over. Because we're not that kind of basketball team. We're a team we want
 to always be on our back. We want everything to be against us. We came out and
 won four straight. Nobody thought we were going to do that. >> back to the
 diamond, adrian beltre returning to los angeles for the first time since he led
 dodgers to the division title back in 2004 top one a two-run shot, his seventh
 of the season, fifth nont of june. He was 2 -3 in the mariners win. And ichiro,
 extending his hit streak to 19 games. >> the angels won a championship at the
 expense of the giants four years ago. John lackey won game seven of the 2002
 world series. Lackey facing san francisco, and facing his counterpart, matt
 morris in a scoreless second inning. Morris delivering a two-run double. Morris
 just one run. Giants win it 3 -2 they've won five straight over the halos. >>
 the last time pat riley coached a team to a championship, the miami heat didn't

 solo shot. We're off to extras. Justin morneau, facing trever miller. And
 morneau just collected his 17 th home run. He has a career high 11 11 game hit
 streak. 19 r.b.i.'s during the streak. Minnesota climbs above 0.5 for the first
 since tax day. 0.5 captioning made possible by espn, inc. 0.5 >> president pat
 riley reshaped the team, adding six new players. After being bashed for that
 and taking over the head coach heat, riley has vindication as he leads miami to
 first nba championship. >> and with that we welcome you inside the espnews
 room. With anthony amey, i'm michelle bonner. Pat riley said he packed one
 suit, one shirt and one tie. He was not thinking or packing far game seven and
 he didn't need to. >> 18 years ago wednesday, riley won the last of his four
 nba championships as a head coach. Now he will commemorate the title as well as
 the heat's first in franchise history. >> who would have thought they would be
 back in dallas 18 mark cuban fined for what the commissioner termed several
 agents of misconduct. Dwyane wade and company ready to go, but not early. Dirk
 nowitzki, two of his 11 first-quarter points. Dallas led by as many as 14 in
 the first quarter. Wade, going to work. He went scoreless the first 10 minutes
 of the game. Went off afterwards. 30 -23 , mavs after one. Second quarter, mavs
 five. Gives it to terry. Later in the second, heat up one. Jason williams, one
 of his seven dipes behind his back to zo mourning. >> that was part of a 13 0
 run. Tied at 53 -53 mourning stuffs terry. Heat up nine. Mavericks out on the
 break. Marquis daniels came in with a total of five points in the series. Mavs
 down seven. Fourth quarter, heat up three. Wade to shaq. He finished with nine
 points. Heat up five. Sagana diop. Those are diop's only two points of the
 game. He would misthe free throw. The mavs are down three. Down five, terry,
 going to put it up. Mourning with five blocks in the game. Mavs down four.
 jerry stackhouse back after being suspended for game five. Off glass. Dallas
 within two. Three-point game now. Wade, with three defenders around him. James
 posey for three. Heat up six. It's a four-point game now. And stackhouse, from
 the corner pocket, he finished with 12 and the mavs are down one. Under 36 to
 go. Three-point game. Dirk nowitzki has two in the fourth. Beats erick dampier.
 loses it. Wade picks it up. Heat up three. 10.6 left. Wade at the line with a
 chance to ice it. Misses the first. Then misses the second. The heat would come
 with the rebound, but traveling is called. So mavs with one last chance. Jason
 terry for three. Rims out. Giving the heat their first title in franchise
 history. They're only the third team in nba history to walk with the title.
 that's a class act with mark cuban showing his appreciation. D. Wade, 36
 points, the m.v.p. Of this series. >> what a finish to an amazing nba playoffs.
 i said it, and i mean it, i would give up six for this one. I would have. I
 would trade them all in for this one. Not disrespectful to any of them that i
 won, but after 18 years, and chasing, you know, combrow keep chasing it, you
 keep chasing it. You get tired. So this gives me a sense of absolute freedom.
 >> we came up short. We know they don't give any awards for coming in second,
 but we provided an awful lot for the whole city of dallas. >> obviously dwyane
 was great after game two or whatever. He was unstoppable. You know, he really
 won them the championship, you know 18 from game three, we were up 10 he just
 took over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put
 this team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong.
 they gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will,
 man, to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i
 to the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the
 cardinals, ozzie guillen was getting socked. Ryan howard socked one out. And

 it again 18 >> alonzo mourning comes up with eight points, six boards and five
 blocks to help the heat win a title and himself a first ring after overcoming a
 kidney disease and transplant. >> the key to you recovering is keeping this
 right, keeping your mind right. Because if you keep this positive and strong,
 then your body is going to follow it. I never gave up up here. I never gave up
 up here. And i think i credit a great deal of my recovery to that, because i
 never gave up up here, because so many people are quick to give up and say why
 me, why me 18 and not realizing there's a whole lot of people out there who
 have it a whole lot worse than you do. Everybody had has problems. Everybody
 has problems. Regardless of how bad you have it, somebody else out there has it

 drives me. >> pillar of strength. Alonzo mourning. >> mark mulder hoping to

 howard, not going to happen this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording
 his first six-out save of the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >>
 together, they might form the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's
 not true, there's no arguing the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane wade
 combine between my two phone bills, it's probably about -7 60 a month. About 60
 0 0 0 probably 100 bucks a month. With vonage, you get unlimited calls to

 are included. And it's just 100 24.99 a month. X 24.99 0 0 0 h 0 >> pat riley

 to the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the
 cardinals, ozzie guillen was getting socked. Ryan howard socked one out. And
 another. How he got his fill of the yankees. Sweden trying to stretch out an
 impressive streak against england. 18 crowd cheering 18 with vonage, i talk as
 much as i want. And pay a lot less. It's just 18 24.99 a month and that
 includes voicemail, caller id, 3 3 way calling and a lot more. The voice
 quality is great. I even get to keep my same phone and phone number. I've had
 vonage for four months. I should have gotten it a long time ago. We're not out
 to change the world. Just the way you talk to it. Sign up now and get your
 first month free. 3 3 >> turnover, terry gets the blocked by mourning, does it
 again 3 >> alonzo mourning comes up with eight points, six boards and five
 blocks to help the heat win a title and himself a first ring after overcoming a
 kidney disease and transplant. >> the key to you recovering is keeping this
 right, keeping your mind right. Because if you keep this positive and strong,
 then your body is going to follow it. I never gave up up here. I never gave up
 up here. And i think i credit a great deal of my recovery to that, because i
 never gave up up here, because so many people are quick to give up and say why
 me, why me 3 and not realizing there's a whole lot of people out there who have
 a whole lot worse than you do. Everybody had has problems. Everybody has
 problems. Regardless of how bad you have it, somebody else out there has it
 worse. Think about that. Sit back and think about that, you know 3 and that's
 what drives me. >> pillar of strength. Alonzo mourning. >> mark mulder hoping
 to continue his success against the white sox. He was 5 -1 career against them.
 three, white sox leading 2 -1 paul konerko. That will score tad iguchi. 3 -1 ,
 white sox. And the flood gates are open. A.j. Pierzynski. A three-run shot. His
 of the year. And condition north america co, yeah he's up again. Singles to
 left. That will score pablo ozuna and iguchi. They score 11 in the inning,
 mulder down after 2 2 sidney ponson hits brian anderson. Next batter, pablo
 ozuna hit by ponson. He says the guys he hit ha v >> and you knew that was
 going to happen. Hits chris duncan. He gets tossed. Now remember last week,
 guillen went off on sean tracey who failed to retaliate. Thinking twice about
 saying anything more. Heads back to clubhouse after being ejected. >> two on
 for howard. Look where this goes. Estimated at 461 feet. It's the first to
 reach the third-deck level in the three-year history of citizens bank park.
 howard goes opposite field. A two-run shot. His second of the day. 25 th of the
 bottom five now, two on for howard. Down the right field lean. He'll drop it
 into third with a triple. Two runs score. He had a career high seven r.b.i. And
 phils are on top 7 -5 top eight, here come the yank, down a run. Runners on the
 johnny damon , right over aaron rowand. He'll drop into third with a triple.
 miguel cairo and mel i can cabrera. 8 -7 yankees. Bottom nine, phils down two
 runs with two on. Howard facing marian owe rivera. And here's the drama.
 howard, not going to happen this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording
 his first six-out save of the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >>
 together, they might form the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's
 not true, there's no arguing the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane wade
 combine x -7 0 0 0 h 0 >> pat riley said he would have traded in the first six
 rings he has for the one he got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he
 didn't have to. He adds to his collection. >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0
 this is your fourth ring. >> it's very sweet. My brother right here, i knew
 when i see him play that he was a special player. Once i came here, i knew it
 was my job to take him to the next level. We developed his alter ego flash.
 he's very unselfish. I told him they're going to double and triple team me and
 go on and do what you do and take over. >> dwyane, what was the first thing
 shaq said to you 0 he told miami he was here to win a championship. >> he call
 med and said i'm coming down there to win a championship. I'm not coming down
 there to mess around and be out on south beach. I'm coming to win a
 championship. He says we've got to have a talk, sit down man-to-man and have a
 talk. Once we did that, everything that happened in l.a. Wasn't going to happen
 miami. He got my back, i got his back and that's the way we always roll. >>
 this is the best team i've ever been on. >> why 0 >> i've been here two years.
 we've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i wasn't in either one of them. >> really
 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i wasn't in any of them. And that's rare for
 me. That's rare for me. But this is a great team. We hinge out together, went
 to the movies together. Anytime anybody is at a family function, everybody
 shows up. The family shows up, the kids show up. Pat riley did a great job of
 putting this team together. >> most people probably don't want to mention this,
 i'm going to bring it up. You have to. The relationship between kobe bryant and
 o'neal was absolutely terrible during the three championships. I think this one
 more to him because he has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away,
 you have to understand, a team is really a family. That's one thing pat riley
 emphasized. You heard him talk about what was in that pen. It's about family.
 when you have a family, you trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be
 first to admit he made as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really
 embracing kobe bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to
 miami and had dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He
 smart enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to
 happen. And that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about
 how incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All
 three finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long
 time. I think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun
 scoring nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a.
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.

 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden

 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms -2 -2 dallas. Fellas,

 disrespectful to any of them that i won, but after 18 years, and chasing, you
 know, combrow keep chasing it, you keep chasing it. You get tired. So this
 gives me a sense of absolute freedom. >> we came up short. We know they don't
 give any awards for coming in second, but we provided an awful lot for the

 they're only the third team in nba history to walk with the title. That's a

 m.v.p. Of this series. >> what a finish to an amazing nba playoffs. >> i said
 it, and i mean it, i would give up six for this one. I would have. I would
 trade them all in for this one. Not disrespectful to any of them that i won,
 but after 18 years, and chasing, you know, combrow keep chasing it, you keep
 chasing it. You get tired. So this gives me a sense of absolute freedom. >> we
 came up short. We know they don't give any awards for coming in second, but we
 provided an awful lot for the whole city of dallas. >> obviously dwyane was
 great after game two or whatever. He was unstoppable. You know, he really won
 them the championship, you know 18 from game three, we were up 10 he just took
 over since then. You know, he never let up. >> i don't want to say i put this
 team on my back. We did it together. Like coach said, it's been 15 strong. Now,
 gave me the opportunity by putting the ball in my happened. And my will, man,
 to prove people wrong, to not worry about what people say about me, when i came
 the series, it was i can't shoot. I don't know where they got that from. But i
 proved to them i can shoot. After that, i proved to them i can play. And that's
 i try to do is prove people wrong all the time. >> being on a championship
 caliber team, you've got to have a great 1 -2 punch. D. Wade is a fabulous
 player. I felt we could have got it done last year. We were just short-handed
 and we had to suffer a little bit. Then we regroup and people doubted us all
 year. But, you know, we were a tight-knit group. >> at just 24 years of age,
 dwyane wade in some very select company. Only rick barry and allen iverson
 averaged more points in their first nba finals trip than wade's 34.7 0 >> you
 started off the press conference 0 0 or you mentioned in the press conference,
 you would trade all four of your championship rings for the one you just
 captured. Why 0 >> well, actually sick. One as a player and one as an assistant
 it's a time in my life where over the last 18 years, since we won one, you know
 a great team that, you know, i've been chasing this with the team, trying to
 get the job done. And you get to a point where sometimes you get a little
 desperate, you know 18 but with this group of guys, with shaquille and
 especially duane and jo 18 18 zo and g.p. Andriuskeviciuser son, all of these
 guys have been sort of cut up and slice and wounded. You know, people don't
 understand. They really don't. They don't understand how much these guys want
 to win and be part of this. And now they will never, ever not be called
 anything else other than a champion. But the media will probably still call us
 some things. But one thing they can't do, they can't ever take that away from
 them. You have no idea how much they wanted it. >> champagne-soaked pat riley.
 here's the short list of coaches who have won nba titles with two different
 teams. >> coming up on espnews 18 18 as the white sox were socking it to the
 cardinals, ozzie guillen was getting socked. Ryan howard socked one out. And
 another. How he got his fill of the yankees. Sweden trying to stretch out an
 impressive streak against england. I save 50 50 on my phone bill. Vonage is 50

 turnover, terry gets the blocked by mourning, does it again 24.99 >> alonzo
 mourning comes up with eight points, six boards and five blocks to help the
 heat win a title and himself a first ring after overcoming a life-threatening
 kidney disease and transplant. >> the key to you recovering is keeping this
 right, keeping your mind right. Because if you keep this positive and strong,
 then your body is going to follow it. I never gave up up here. I never gave up
 up here. And i think i credit a great deal of my recovery to that, because i
 never gave up up here, because so many people are quick to give up and say why
 me, why me 24.99 and not realizing there's a whole lot of people out there who
 have it a whole lot worse than you do. Everybody had has problems. Everybody
 has problems. Regardless of how bad you have it, somebody else out there has it
 think about that. Sit back and think about that, you know 24.99 and that's what
 me. >> pillar of strength. Alonzo mourning. >> mark mulder hoping to continue
 his success against the white sox. He was 5 -1 career against them. Bottom
 three, white sox leading 2 -1 paul konerko. That will score tad iguchi. 3 -1 ,
 white sox. And the flood gates are open. A.j. Pierzynski. A three-run shot. His
 of the year. And condition north america co, yeah he's up again. Singles to
 left. That will score pablo ozuna and iguchi. They score 11 in the inning,
 mulder down after 2 2 sidney ponson hits brian anderson. Next batter, pablo
 ozuna hit by ponson. He says the guys he hit ha v >> and you knew that was
 going to happen. Hits chris duncan. He gets tossed. Now remember last week,
 guillen went off on sean tracey who failed to retaliate. Thinking twice about
 saying anything more. Heads back to clubhouse after being ejected. >> two on
 for howard. Look where this goes. Estimated at 461 feet. It's the first to
 reach the third-deck level in the three-year history of citizens bank park.
 howard goes opposite field. A two-run shot. His second of the day. 25 th of the
 bottom five now, two on for howard. Down the right field lean. He'll drop it
 into third with a triple. Two runs score. He had a career high seven r.b.i. And
 phils are on top 7 -5 top eight, here come the yank, down a run. Runners on the
 johnny damon , right over aaron rowand. He'll drop into third with a triple.
 miguel cairo and mel i can cabrera. 8 -7 yankees. Bottom nine, phils down two
 runs with two on. Howard facing marian owe rivera. And here's the drama.
 howard, not going to happen this time. Ground out to second. Rivera, recording
 his first six-out save of the season as the yankees end a three-game slide. >>
 together, they might form the most unstoppable duo in the nba. Even if that's
 not true, there's no arguing the results. Shaquille o'neal and dwyane wade
 combine for x -7 0 0 0 h 0 >> pat riley said he would have traded in the first
 six rings he has for the one he got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and. Wade he
 didn't have to. He adds to his collection. >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0
 this is your fourth ring. >> it's very sweet. My brother right here, i knew
 when i see him play that he was a special player. Once i came here, i knew it
 was my job to take him to the next level. We developed his alter ego flash.
 he's very unselfish. I told him they're going to double and triple team me and
 go on and do what you do and take over. >> dwyane, what was the first thing
 shaq said to you 0 he told miami he was here to win a championship. >> he call
 med and said i'm coming down there to win a championship. I'm not coming down
 there to mess around and be out on south beach. I'm coming to win a
 championship. He says we've got to have a talk, sit down man-to-man and have a
 talk. Once we did that, everything that happened in l.a. Wasn't going to happen
 miami. He got my back, i got his back and that's the way we always roll. >>
 this is the best team i've ever been on. >> why 0 >> i've been here two years.
 we've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i wasn't in either one of them. >> really
 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i wasn't in any of them. And that's rare for
 me. That's rare for me. But this is a great team. We hinge out together, went
 to the movies together. Anytime anybody is at a family function, everybody
 shows up. The family shows up, the kids show up. Pat riley did a great job of
 putting this team together. >> most people probably don't want to mention this,
 i'm going to bring it up. You have to. The relationship between kobe bryant and
 o'neal was absolutely terrible during the three championships. I think this one
 more to him because he has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away,
 you have to understand, a team is really a family. That's one thing pat riley
 emphasized. You heard him talk about what was in that pen. It's about family.
 when you have a family, you trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be
 first to admit he made as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really
 embracing kobe bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to
 miami and had dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He
 smart enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to
 happen. And that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about
 how incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All
 three finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long
 time. I think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun
 scoring nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a.
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.
 hadn't started because he had a yellow card. In the 34 th minute, the high
 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. Go go go -2 yes -2 hey let's order a
 pizza. Make it a thin crust. You got it -2 -2 sfx: phone rings -2 hello -2 ya,

 daniel sergeant. The celebration began on the court and continued on the flight

 festivities won't be interrupted by anything like rest. Riley said they'll
 sleep in the summertime. They arrived home just before 7 :00 a.m. This morning
 and welcomed by fans at miami officials are trying to plan where and when will
 the parade one loss in the last 11 starts. 6 -1 over that stretch. The tigers
 have won seven straight against the national league. The english team will play
 of the world cup without michael owen. The striker left the the game with a
 knee injury, a torn acl. England has only three strikers left. Owen's right
 knee buckled after he played a pass. He was carried off of the field on a
 stretcher. After he was seen by the doctors of the he knew he was in trouble as
 as it happened. England plays ecuador in the second round on sunday. Today's
 action mexico hasn't lost in the first round of the world cup since 1994 good
 thing since they get into the round of 16 with either a win or a tie. Portugal
 clinched a birth, the first time they've made it past first play since 1996
 portugal and mexico, that's a goal, 1 0 portugal. Sixth minute no score. That
 sets up a penalty shot. Simmio scores on the penalty shot. Mexico down 2 -1
 second half. Hand ball called on miguel. P in the box, another penalty shot.
 this time omar bravo with the ance. Bravo's pen shot sailing way over the top
 of the goal. Portugal wins it 2 -1 taking all of the first round games in group
 and extending their unbeaten run. Mexico will play the group c winner and
 portugal will play either the netherlands or argentina. Angola could possibly
 advance to the next round with a big win over already eliminated iran. 60 th
 minute. No score. Angola scoring its first ever world cup to take the lead. 75
 th minute, iran takes it down 1 0 another header. This one ties the game at
 one. Now we go to stoppage time. Angola with the kick. Huge chance for the win.

 world cup is also over. Top stories are coming up on snens. The heat brought

 like the new fresh toasted tuscan chicken sandwich. All-white meat chicken,
 grilled veggies, melted cheese and tuscan vinaigrette. All fresh out of the
 oven and all with 8 grams of fat. 8 grams 8 and with the help of the tuscan
 chicken sandwich, i'm keepin' it off. Subway. Eat fresh. X 8 0 0 0 h 0 >> pat
 riley said he would have traded in the first six rings he has for the one he
 got on tuesday. Thanks to shaq and d. Wade he didn't have to. He adds to his
 collection. >> shaq, how sweet does this feel 0 this is your fourth ring. >>
 it's very sweet. My brother right here, i knew when i see him play that he was
 a special player. Once i came here, i knew it was my job to take him to the
 next level. We developed his alter ego flash. He's very unselfish. I told him
 they're going to double and triple team me and go on and do what you do and
 take over. >> dwyane, what was the first thing shaq said to you 0 he told miami
 was here to win a championship. >> he call med and said i'm coming down there
 to win a championship. I'm not coming down there to mess around and be out on
 south beach. I'm coming to win a championship. He says we've got to have a
 talk, sit down man-to-man and have a talk. Once we did that, everything that
 happened in l.a. Wasn't going to happen in miami. He got my back, i got his
 back and that's the way we always roll. >> this is the best team i've ever been
 >> why 0 >> i've been here two years. We've own had 0.9 of an argument. And i
 wasn't in either one of them. >> really 0.9 0.9 0.9 >> maybe one or two and i
 wasn't in any of them. And that's rare for me. That's rare for me. But this is
 a great team. We hinge out together, went to the movies together. Anytime
 anybody is at a family function, everybody shows up. The family shows up, the
 kids show up. Pat riley did a great job of putting this team together. >> most
 people probably don't want to mention this, but i'm going to bring it up. You
 have to. The relationship between kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal was
 absolutely terrible during the three championships. I think this one means more
 him because he has a side kick he really likes. >> what i took away, you have
 to understand, a team is really a family. That's one thing pat riley
 emphasized. You heard him talk about what was in that pen. It's about family.
 when you have a family, you trust one another. I think shaquille o'neal will be
 first to admit he made as many mistakes early on in this relationship by really
 embracing kobe bryant. He refused to make the same mistake once he came to
 miami and had dwyane wade. But give dwyane wade credit for also recognizing. He
 smart enough to see the problems they had there. He would not allow that to
 happen. And that's why right now, they're our world champs. >> you think about
 how incredible it is, shaquille o'neal, three championships coming in. All
 three finals m.v.p. He's been obviously the most dominant player in a long
 time. I think this is his most rewarding championship of all. He had more fun
 scoring nine points in the closeout game than he did in his three rings in l.a.
 gets right to the heart of their relationship and the humility that dwyane wade
 shown to shaquille o'neal. All he want the was respect. Shaquille o'neal paved
 the way for this guy. Great, great for the nba to have dwyane wade on this
 stage right now. >> until the last three months when sports fans thought of
 duke, they thought of blue devils basketball. The primary reason for that is
 mike krzyzewski. Thanks to three national championships and 10 final four,
 coach k is arguably the most powerful person on the duke campus. But the hall
 of famer chose not to speak of the infamous march 13 party which brought about
 rape charges for three lacrosse player, until tuesday. >> i just try to add
 support and just say run the course, you know, whether it be, you know, just
 saying to my athletic director, i'm with you. My president, what can i do. With
 lacrosse coach, who is a dear friend. You know, i don't know what mike pressler
 wrong. I love duke. You know, duke is a great, great school. It will always be
 a great school. >> you heard krzyzewski mention mike pressler who resigned. He
 spoke publicly for the first time since the incident, telling "sports
 illustrated" 13 13 >> world cup soccer. Sweden has never lost a world cup to
 england. Tough break for england's michael owen whose knee buckles underneath
 him. He goes down hard. It's twisted. He would leave on the stretcher. The
 england coach says it doesn't look good at all. He is replaced by peter crouch.
 hadn't started because he had a yellow card. In the 34 th minute, the high
 volley kick. England takes an early 1 0 lead. Bounces is 0 0 it off his chest
 and in. Sweden is down a goal. Off the throw-in. And no one can really drol the
 here. Paul robinson is blocked. And sweden's enrique larsson gets it in. Sweden
 it up at 2 -2 both teams moving on. >> now the off-season moves made by miami
 have paid off in the form of a title. We're back to dasms -2 -2 dallas. -2
 announcer -2 for those who love pistachios. There's new planters pistachios
 lovers mix. 50 50 pistachios. 100 100 love. > >> wade has got it. Way to hold
 on. And the miami heat are chat yons of the basketball world, whoo 100 the nba
 champions for the first time in franchise history. >> yes, another ring for
 riley and shaq. The heat back in miami as nba champions. World cup today, round
 closing out, portugal and mexico play and advance. And the seating out at
 bibble, roger federer and ma rest mo grab number one spots. "the hotlist" is
 now. >> from the worldwide leader in sports, this is "the hotlist" on espnews.
 >> hi, everybody, good afternoon, brian kenny here, welcome to "the hotlist."
 we're go over the stunning change of direction in the nba finals. Derek fisher
 of the golden state warriors will join us among many others, of course, and
 we'll talk baseball this afternoon with adam dunn of the reds. Justin more no
 of the twins, and hall of fame catcher, gary carter. Right now, here's "the
 hotlist," top stories of the day. >> danyelle sargent joins us with the top
 stories of the day. >> the miami heat celebration began on the court and
 continued on the flight home from dallas, where coach, pat riley, said his team
 22 bottles of crystal after winning the first championship in franchise
 history, you can understand why those festivities won't be interrupted by a
 little thing like rest. Riley said we'll sleep in the uppertime. They arrived
 home just before 7 :00 a.m. This morning, there's shaq carrying that big trophy
 he promised the fans. They were all welcomed at the miami international
 airport. A parade is tentatively scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. The heat
 aren't the only ones basking in the glory of the championship. The carolina
 hurricanes celebrated after winning the stanley cup finals with a parade
 through downtown raleigh. The english team will play the remainder of the world
 without michael owen. The striker left tuesday's match with a knee injury. A
 scan revealed a torn right a.c.l. Without owe wen england has three strikers
 left, one is a 17 17 year-old with very limited international experience. Owe
 wens' right knee buckles. He was treated by doctors and carried off the field
 on a stretcher. England plays ecuador in the second round on sunday. Mexico
 hasn't lost in the first round of the world cup since 1994 a good thing since
 they get into the round of 16 with either a win or a tie. >> sixth minute, no
 score. Drawing the defense. Nice pass who scores there, 1 0 , portugal. Later,
 first half off a portugal corner kick. Marquez calls for the hand ball. Sets up
 penalty shot. Hesitating on the move. Scores on the penalty kick. It's 2 0 ,
 portugal. Second half, mexico down 2 0 portugal in the box, and guess what 0
 another penalty shot, this one for bra vofment here he is. Bravo's penalty shot
 over the top of the goal. Portugal holds on. They win 2 -1 , taking all three
 first-round games in group d and extending their run to 17 international games.
 portugal just needed a tie ta win their group. So five starters rested with
 yellow cards. Portugal scored two goals early on and mexico was trying to crawl
 of that hole. And a little disconcerting for mexico, they missed a penalty
 kick. Perez goes down with a second yellow for a red card for taking a dive in
 the box. They're going to come up against the very good side of either
 argentina or the netherlands. >> angola did not score a goal in the tournament.
 has been eliminated but is looking to avoid its first throy-loss appearance. >>
 score, angola on the charge. Flavio using his head. Right there angola scoring
 its first-ever goal. They take a 1 0 lead. Iran with a corner kick. Down 1 0
 another header. Iran tying the game up at 1 -1 angola with a free kick. A huge
 chance for the win. Tries to sneak this shot. That's an easy save there. This
 game ending in a 1 -1 draw. Angola will not advance to the next run. Iran's run
 the world cup is also over. Afternoon baseball for you today. Tigers and
 brewers. Detroit leading 2 -1 craig monroe had an r.b.i. Double. Robinson added
 r.b.i. Single. He's also getting it done on the hill. >> danyelle, thank you

 again, the miami heat nba champions. Joining us right now, david moore joins us
 from the "dallas morning news." dave, brian kenny here from espn. How are you
 -1 >> good, how are you. >> first, tell me. Down 2 0 , down 13 in game three
 late. Now improbable not to lose again from that point 13 >> oh, what miami did
 13 again, we saw the burgeoning stardom of dwyane wade in this series. What he
 did in those last four games is going to be a standard for a lot of players.
 and to do this in his third year and to get them to this point is really
 amazing and quite a tribute to him. >> you know, wade 36 points, david, 10
 rebounds, five assists, four steals, three blocks, 16 -21 from the free-throw
 line. But beyond jordan, what other players in the history of the game have had
 type of nba finals or nba postseason run at this stage of -21 -21 >> at this
 stage of their career you throw that in as well. Pat riley was asked before the
 as he's been asked hundreds of times over the last couple of years, who do you
 compare dwyane wade to, and last night he said he's a signature player unto
 himself. He remind me a little bit of a panther or a leopard up in a tree who
 lets prey go by and decides when he's going to pick his spot and pounce. Well,
 this guy pounced in his third year. All the lebron mania is justified, and
 lebron has achieved more individually at this stage of his career, but you have
 include dwyane wade in on the argument of who the best young player in the game
 right now. >> you do have to wonder, i know they brought that up on "cold
 pizza," i was listening in. What happens if lebron james is on the heat -21 do
 they win an nba championship -21 >> i think there's a pretty good chance. But
 also, dwyane wade, the way he changes his game and picks his spots, i don't
 think you can diminish what he does. You get back to the whole thing on
 chemistry. This is just an ideal fit. Pat riley took a lot of heat in tearing
 up that team and bringing in a lot of appeared to be disparate or ill-fitting
 parts, some veterans that there were questions about, how much they had left,
 whether they could co-exist. It looked like a chemistry experiment during the
 regular season, but they came together in the postseason. >> avery johnson said
 mavs fell in love with their jump shot. Do you agree with that -21 >> it was
 very uncharacterries tisk of them. Their play deteriorated after they beat san
 antonio in the second round. They used their speed in the perimeter to put
 defense in a bad position. They tried to slow it down against phoenix because
 they couldn't run with them. Then when they tried to run with miami they
 couldn't get it back. They attacked and got out early in the game, ran off to a
 14 point lead and really hurt the heat on the perimeter with their speed and
 then just got away from it. And to me the most telling thing was seven minutes
 left in the game. Dallas was already in the foul situation. Every time they're
 fouled, they're going to the line. What do they do 14 the next two shots they
 came in and jacked up three-pointers. >> what is it, david, in the dynamic of
 the finals, we've had this kind of two years in a row. The pistons looked like
 they were outclassed last year and forced a seven-game series. This year miami
 looked like they had no shot. They come back and win it in six. The first two
 days of both these series, we thought, wow, had bad 14 14 how bad for the
 league, how bad for the series. Both teams changed around completely, why is
 that 14 >> well, coaches say each game is self-contained in the finals, and
 there's so much attention now. Everything is exaggerated. And, you know, there
 is really a fine line. And if it's late in the game, a couple of possessions
 get away from you and a team knows that it has to do some desperate things to
 try to catch up to win, suddenly you have an eight, 12 12 point game and you're
 geez, how can this team stay with them. And then when you have the gap going
 back and an extra day to analyze it and probably overanalyze it, you don't see
 what can happen. I think we're going to continue to see these kinds of things.
 by and large these teams are going to be pretty even when they get to this
 point. >> what does this do to pat riley's legacy 12 >> if it needed s
 cementing, this was it. I thought it was interesting during the course of the
 series it was brought up and someone suggested that really this team has less
 expectations than the ones you took to championships in l.a. Or the one you
 tried to win a championship with in new york. And he corrected him very quickly
 said, look, no team has had more expectations on it than this one. Because this
 a franchise last year that came one game short of advancing to the finals. I
 decided to tear the whole thing up and bring in all these people. I would argue
 was more 12 12 there were more expectations on this team than any other i've
 ever coached. During the regular season it didn't look like it was going to
 happen for them. I believe they were 2 -14 against teams that won the division
 and also throw the mavericks in there as well. And for them to come together in
 playoffs, it really is surprising in a lot of ways. >> shaq called riley the
 best coach he's ever had. Was he caught up in the moment -14 not that he might
 not think that. But i was waiting for phil jackson mentioned somewhere, and it
 never quite happened. What do you make of that -14 >> he has said that. He
 really respects pat, and shaq is a historian of the game, if you will, and he
 knows what pat riley did with kareem abdul-jabbar at the end of his career,
 what he was able to do with patrick ewing in new york. And i think shaq
 gravitates toward that. And for this point of his career, i think he feels that
 is the best guy that he could have. >> are the mavs at this level to stay,
 david -14 >> that's interesting. Teams that lose in a young nucleus, like the
 mavericks, they sake solace in the fact that next year we can be there. I think
 can make a strong argument that they may be better equipped next year to win a
 title. When you're up 2 0 , you're up 13 points on the road with six minutes
 left and you've dominated the series at that point, to go from that to losing,
 i just can't imagine next year, if they are able to get back, that it's going
 to be set up better for them than what it was right now. >> david, we
 appreciate your time. Good talking to you. >> thanks a lot. >> thank you. David
 of the "dallas morning news" joining us here on "the hotlist." when we return,
 theytor it 13 13 tore it up, put it back together. Joe sheehan and a look at
 the marlins. 13 hey, what's up, roger 13 13 hey, stu. What's up 13 hey, a
 supplier gave me these. And i figured if anybody could use them, you could. Oh
 yeah, that's nice. Thanks. Uh, i don't know if they're any good or not. 13
 they'll be all right. 13 yeah, yeah, but you might want to check them. Okay.
 all right. 13 laughing 13 yeah. It's funny, huh 13 real funny. >> time to talk
 a little baseball. Joe sheehan of baseballprospectus.com joins us on "the
 hotlist." how are you doing 13 >> i'm doing fine. >> it's a chance for us to
 talk a little marlins baseball. What do you think of their m.o. 13 paring down
 a team, you get rid of your veterans before they're washed up. They do it
 earlier, while the veterans still have market value. What are your thoughts on
 the way they tore it apart this time. 13 it's a complicated question. This
 franchise has done it twice now. So there are business issues that aren't
 necessarily baseball issues. Just from a baseball standpoint, not only was it
 the right decision, they did a great job. There was an article last year that
 said if you're going to be an 83 83 win team, you're better off paring it down
 so you can win 95 to 100 games in three years. So that's what the marlins have
 done here. And they did a better job this time than they did back in 1998 the
 talent that they picked up over the last six months is much better than the
 talent they picked up trading off alou and those guys. All told, you can
 definitely see the core of what's going to be a winning team. >> you know,
 they've got blue chip prospects all the way through. Jacobs is hitting,
 hermida, if he's healthy, he's going to be something. Ramirez, and uggla turned
 to be something. Are they all at the all-star level 1998 >> no, mike jacobs is
 going to be a sorento type player. He can play the position. You're seeing his
 peek right now. Uggla was never a top chair pros peculiar. But ramirez has been
 surprise. He's shown a lost power, which has really been a surprise. He's
 played the position. You're talking about a guy who could be an all-star for a
 number of years to come. Jeremy hermida you and i are both high on. Injury has
 really affected his season. Hermida and ramirez are going to be the core guys
 going forward. I think they need to hang on to miguel cabrera as well. They
 have so much pitching coming through the system that you can see them being the
 leaders in pitching and defense two or three years out. >> i know jared weaver
 to the minors, this happened, i guess, over the weekend, we were talking about
 it. Your view of that. Isn't there something else to be done when you have a
 guy with a 1.4 rear, i know it's his brother, but isn't there a roster spot
 somewhere 1.4 >> the angels have such deep pitching, that, no. You're not going
 move weaver to the bullpen. Cologne, escobar, they've got the deep rotation.
 you're better off holding on to weaver for a little bit longer, see if he can
 straighten out. He can turn out to have trade value at the deadline as opposed
 to letting him go. I think it was the right decision from a team standpoint to
 hold on for another six weeks with jeff weaver, see if they can get something
 from him. It's not that big a deal. >> really 1.4 >> no. >> cost them a few
 wins 1.4 >> over four starts, maybe it costs you one win. I also think that
 jeff weaver who's looked bad this season, he's a good enough pitcher. He can
 still be an effective major league starting pitcher. >> the all-star game means
 field advantage in the world series. Your thoughts on that. >> i couldn't care
 less. This is a gimmick. The all-star game is an exhibition. >> no, it's not.
 >> so at the end of the game 1.4 1.4 think about the ends of an all-star game
 when all those token guys from the royals and the devil rays and the pirates
 and the rockies are in there. >> they're token all-stars. >> does it really
 matter to 1.4 1.4 who's going to be the token royals all-star 1.4 do you really
 to have home field advantage coming down to greds lanic 1.4 this is a gimmick.
 the all-star game, the reason the all-star game needs us now is because the
 delineations to the leagues have been eliminated because of interleague play.
 so you don't have the sense of separate leagues anymore. >> right, right. >>
 that's why you have to do this. Leagues used to hate each other, brian. Now
 there's no sense of this that matters. What you had was people said everybody
 needs to get into the game, which you still have. If you want to actually make
 this game count and actually have the true all-stars, the best players in the
 game, play six or seven innings. >> so you disagree with that aspect of the
 format, not attaching significance to it. >> it should be significant enough to
 the best players in baseball playing in an exhibition game. If you have to
 speist it up, don't go a.l. Make it u.s. International, make it guys who play
 for teams that wear pinstripes versus teams that wear solids. >> it's still
 reflective of the league's depth, though, don't you think 1.4 if it's grezz
 lanic who reflects it 1.4 1.4 >> think about a weak team in your league. That's
 way it goes. Every league has a weak team. >> right, so you have to deal with
 those guys, too. >> that's a ridiculous way to decide who gets home field
 advantage in the all-star game. You have the worst player on the worst teams.
 >> no, you have the best player on the worst team. If that's the way it works
 out, that's the way it works out. >> brian, it's terrible. >> it's not
 terrible. I would change the format. >> where's elliott 1.4 >> that's it,
 you're gone. I would whang change the format but i wouldn't change the
 significance of it. As far as having it mean something, it adds so much more to
 game. >> why can't it mean watching the best players on one field at one time
 1.4 >> nobody cared enough anymore. It's not special anymore. >> give me three
 regular season games over the all-star, brian. >> i still like seeing the
 all-star game. You also have the futures game coming up, the x.m. Satellite
 radio all-star futures game coming up. Give me the prognosis, long-term
 prognosis on some of these guys. Alex gordon of kansas city. How good or great
 will he be 1.4 >> pure hitter. He doesn't have the defensive skills. You're
 talk about a guy who's going to start at third base and be a 0.3 hitter. A guy
 like jim thome is already the best hitter in the entire royals organization. He
 be their all-star. >> howie kendrick of the angels. Came up, i guess it wasn't
 good enough for him. How good is this guy 0.3 >> they messed around with him.
 he doesn't walk a whole lot. But he is a legitimate 0.34 hitter, and there
 aren't awol lot of guys like that. He's 0.34 0.34 if you do that, he's going to
 an all-star for a number of years. >> drew for the diamondbacks. >> he's more
 of a polished product. He doesn't have the development time that other guys
 have, but he can probably be a start be shortstop on the major leagues right
 now. Hitting at a 0.29 level. Let's not forget, brian, a guy who can hit the
 ball with power is going to look good in arizona. >> fiplip hughes. How good is
 0.29 good he's a lot different than the recent yankee pitching prospects. Guys
 like wang have come along and haven't been pure stuff guys. Philip hughes is a
 pure stuff guy. He's stayed healthy so far and i think the yankees will hold on
 him through the trade deadline. He'll be in the protation early next year. >>
 joe, good having you on here despite your transgressions. >> i don't forget a
 thing. Bye-bye, joe. >> take care, brian. >> joe sheehan of baseball

 assignment. Whatever you want, but get out. You know, it's one thing to miss a
 penalty shot, but to miss it like that. We're human, even a top player. But
 man, what a miss. That's about the worst miss you'll ever see. Danyelle, thank
 you. We'll come back and talk world cup. Allan hopkins is going to join us. Men
 the square table, when toasting, do we clink tops or bottoms 10 let's just take
 look. Hmmm. If the tops touch, then our saliva is touching. Well, then
 technically that would qualify as a kiss. Oh, come on 10 tell you what, why
 don't we just touch bottoms. No, thanks, hollywood. I ain't into that. Bottles.
 law 10 10 together 10 man law. The great taste of miller lite. Always a good
 call. >> we return here on "the hotlist." alenhopkins join us right now. If you
 his eyes gazing upward, he's watching argentina. Let's get all these games in.
 portugal, how good are they 10 >> very good, very good. This is a team that
 hasn't done very well in the world cup since 1966 they had the so-called golden
 now led by figo. He's playing as well as any individual player in this
 tournament. They scored some very good goals today that got renaldo playing
 very well, all their big guns are playing very well. The head coach of portugal
 not get the credit he deserves. He's now one of three coaches that have won at
 least 10 world cup games. They've done very well in the tournament. >> they
 were playing simultaneously, right 10 portugal and mexico was playing, so iran
 and angola are playing at the same time. So there was no resting, thinking
 we're already in. How did that unfold 10 >> well, the real background story is
 years ago fifa decided they had to play the matches simultaneously because
 there's a lot of funny business going on. To seep the integrity of these
 matches, they play them simultaneously. And the big drama was angola was
 winning, and they needed to win by a couple of goals. Mexico missed a kick that
 have tied it at 2 -2 once they found out iran had scored, they seemed to
 realize that they were going to back themselves into the round of 16 , and
 that's exactly what happened. >> the missed penalty shot. I understand anybody
 can miss a penalty shot. But that's big. 30 feet up above the crossbar. How do
 you view that as a player 30 >> well, you really 30 30 it's so bad that you
 probably have to shake it off. It will be in the back of their minds. Mexico
 has had a poor history of taking penalties in the world cup. I don't know why.
 but over the years they've always come up short on penalties. And for many
 mexican fans that was another penalty kick. >> netherlands versus argentina. If
 had been on the line, if there had been something at stake 30 30 we're going to
 to do a live look-in here. Had there been something on the line, how hard would
 have been 30 >> everyone was looking forward to it. Argentina, netherlands.
 royalty, really, of world cup football. But the question is this. Now that you
 know what's going on, you have to rest players, you have to think ahead. The
 netherlands have semple players on yellow cards so they don't want to spend it
 for the next round. Argentina playing second-tier players. There's very little
 that separates these two teams. So even though the sense of urgency is not
 there, i think both teams still want to go out and put on a good showing. And
 actually, for the coaches, they probably really enjoy playing against a
 high-quality opponent but not having to play for everything on the line. >>
 again, this is a live look-in. You are looking live at the netherlands versus
 argentina. The netherlands, i guess, have regrouped. They had very good squads,
 they haven't been back to the top, but they were there 20 , 30 years ago. How
 deep are they 30 >> they have a great young player, a teenager. What has
 troubled the netherlands is they have terrible team chemistry. They have so
 many individuals that are constantly shaking the tree, upsetting the apple
 cart. And now they've come into this tournament without any major locker room
 distractions, and that's the reason why they're playing as well as they have.
 and argentina with so many talented young players, they're feeling like they're
 their groove and their stride as well. This will be a match that both teams
 will be happy with no matter the outcome. They get a chance to test themselves
 against a high-quality opponent without necessarily leaving it all out on the
 line. >> this is stoppage time here in the first half. Going into the next one,
 we had a good free kick there and i don't think that's what we're going to get.
 owen, a brilliant player, torn a.c.l., done. How bad for england 30 >> it's a
 terrible blow for owen and england. The only player that england really had to
 really look toward in terms of having done this before on the big stage is
 michael owen. I've always said this. Noncontact injuries in this game are the
 absolute worst. >> how does that happen 30 did his knee just buckle 30 >> it's
 timing. There was no mechanism, as you saw. It was time for his knee to go.
 even though he had not been in his top form and not been injury-free, he's the
 one player that the other coaches have to game plan for. Instead of having two
 world class strikers like rudy and owen, now you have crouch who's getting a
 chance to play at the highest level alongside rooney, who's coming back. Right
 now that's a big blow for england. But if you look at it on paper, owen has not
 clickin on all cylinders for them. >> tomorrow, u.s. Versus ghana. What should
 we be looking for early 30 you mentioned look for team speed for ghana and the
 u.s. Has not had to deal with that yet. What should a fan be looking for 30 >>
 the big key is shaping up, because without the two strikers for ghana that are
 suspended, they really have to step up their game. The question is are they
 ready. Sometimes what you don't know doesn't hurt you. They know they have to
 go for everything and they have to score goals. And another psychological
 factor, now that all the african teams are out, they're pulling for ghana. But
 they will have to control their player, and wherever he is on the field you
 have to watch him. And the team speed, that's why i look for eddie johnson to
 get his opportunity to shine when all the lights come up at the world cup and
 do what he does best, which is performing when it matters most. >> allen
 hopkins here on the world cup. We'll take a short break. When we return, we'll

 love it. >> should i get jason kubel 3 >> got to make a move right now. >> how
 exciting. >> america waits for this move. >> do you think he's going to have
 success against clemens 3 >> probably not. >> so i have clemens, too. >> so
 it's a win-win. >> or it's a lose-lose. I can't control it either way. >> kubel
 0 -4 , but clemens gives up 10 runs. How are you going to feel 10 >> that's
 bad. You play the percentage. >> pick up a reliever, a closer type. >> really
 10 no. >> you don't get it. >> what do you mean i don't get it 10 >> you don't
 get it. >> what don't i get 10 what don't i get 10 really. >> why pick up a
 reliever 10 you can't get saves out of the guy. The chances of kubel over
 clemens are probably slim. >> you need another run. >> what about if that
 middle reliever gets a win 10 >> you knee that good inning of relief. >> no, i
 don't need relief. >> that's bad strategy. How many of these things have you
 won 10 >> a lot. >> it's your team, though. Joey gathright gets dealt. What are
 thoughts on him 10 >> i think we can make the statement if he plays every day
 for kansas city as he's supposed to, he might actually lead the major leagues
 in steals from this point out. If he's out there as a free agent, get him right
 he has 12 steals. His numbers weren't great with tampa bay, but he was always
 looking over his shoulder. Traded to kansas city late last night. He's going to
 sfeefled. Gathright is about as fast as anybody in baseball. I can see him
 stealing a couple of bases per week. Get him now. >> not jason kubel 12 >>
 kubel is great, too. They do different things. I like kubel. >> i already did.
 it's in now. >> i don't get the middle relief strategy. >> in your team, where
 you have all-starting pitching, it makes little since. >> kubel, you're
 probably going to dump him the next day. >> probably. Seth mcclung, you see big
 would you pick him up if >> you wouldn't care in your league. He's being sent
 down to the minor leagues to learn how to be a closer. The guy throws 95 heat,
 great arm. He done have a good number go pitch. He's a failed starter who's
 going to go to the bullpen. In two weeks he's going to be up and closing for
 tampa bay. I think seth mcclung could be a decent closer. Tyler walker would be
 the way out. Mcclung, if you can get him in a deep league and stash him away.
 >> matt kahne has been brilliant, then shaky. Would you pick him up 95 >> in
 the interleague he's allowed two hits. His e.r.a. Is over six. He'll get better
 the season goes on as a young pitcher. Makes a lot of mistakes. I think he'll
 be more comfortable in the second half. You're also going to want his teammate.
 think the giants are going to get better in the second half. Get these guys
 now. They're going to have good numbers. You can see it coming. He had a
 one-hitter a couple of weeks. >> john lee 95 >> he's on the did. L., and nobody
 him. Get ahead of the curve. 1.29 e.r.a. Right now. That doesn't jibe. What
 that means is that jon lieber's been unlucky. He will get better. Jon lieber, a
 second-half option who you can get for basically nothing right now. He's not
 going to win 20 games, but he will get better. He's not going to finish with an
 near 6 0 get him now before he comes off the d.l. >> his percentages aren't
 good, but his totals in the middle of that lineup in st. Louis could be bret
 tee good. >> had some big days. Double didn't in home runs. Probably on his way
 90 r.b.i.'s. Not a bad player at all. His average is a little bit inflated
 right now. Not a big base field right now. I don't get it. He's got 10 homers,
 prett safe stats. Get him, get him. He's safe. Let's put it that way. He's
 safer than gonzalez. >> adrian gonzalez for the baurds. >> thee homers in the
 last four games. Developing power. Even in san diego, very tough hitter's park.
 think he's going to hit about 20 hrls. Up he's up to 10 already. Adrian
 gonzalez should be on more leagues, if at all, for the 10 home runs. He's not a
 player, and next year he develops that chad tracy type power, 20 to 25 homers.
 >> mike napoli. >> seven home runs, and they're so desperate for power, that
 they batted him fifth. There's nobody to protect him. Napoli is a decent
 addition. The most home runs for any catcher is 10 so you might as well pick
 him up and see if he's for real. Big power. He whonts had 166 strikeouts in his
 in the minors. The angels are going to make a trade at some point and move down
 the order. But something is going to happen here with jeff weaver escobar. Own
 napoli for now, as catchers go, he's doing very well. >> catching is deeper
 than i thought it would be. Again, we're in a 10 10 team league. But it's
 deeper than i thought. Estrada had been out there. >> it's actually a deep
 position, but no stars. Martinez hasn't hit for a lot of power. 10 home runs is
 most. That's awfully low. Even for catching. >> there's a lot of depth. >>
 that's why you should pick up guys who are hot and don't p afraid to dump your
 estrada types. >> that's good strategy. Now you're finally making some sense
 around here. Let's take some emails. >> jeremy is going to make his major
 league debut on sunday. They got rid of johnson who's now a red sox. If you're
 expecting a field in the second half, it's not going to happen. Pick him up. I
 expect him to be good. Alex gordon is in double-a and i expect him after
 september. >> he's going to be in the futures game, though. >> great future,
 great future. >> thanks for dropping by. Eric karabell from espn.com. When we

 continued on the flight home from dallas last night where coach pat riley said
 his team drank 22 bottles of champagne after winning the first title in
 history. He said we are not sleeping. We will sleep in the summertime. He and
 the rest of the heat arrived home just before 7 :00 a.m. And were woked by fans
 the miami international airport. Shaq was carrying the trophy. A parade is
 scheduled for friday 0 the english team will play the remained are of the world
 without michael owen who left tuesday with a torn right a.c.l. Without him they
 three strikers left one of which is a 17 17 year-old with very limited
 international experience. Owen's right knee buckled after he played a pass. He
 was treated by doctors and carried off the field. He said he knew he was in
 trouble as soon as it happened. They play ecuador sunday in the second round.
 >> mexico needs a win or a tie to advance. Sixth minute, no score. Then
 portugal makes it 1 0 later in the first half, same score off a portugal corner
 rafael marquez called for this and a penalty shot and samai puts portugal up 2
 0 then ruiz miguel and another penalty shot. So all the pressure is on bravo.
 not even close. Sailing over the top of the goal. Portugal wins 2 -1 taking all
 first-round games. We have more. >> portugal game in the game needing just a
 tie so they decided to direct five of the starters with yellow cards. Didn't
 matter, portugal scored two goals and mexico was trying to crawl out of the
 hole. A little disconcerting for mexico in that they were not sharp in front of
 goal. Missed a penalty kick. Luis perez goes down for his second yellow card.
 they will come up in the second round. They will be up against argentina or the
 >> with the mexico loss angola could advance to the next round. Looking for a
 big win. 60 th minute. Plavio uses his head and angola scores its first goal
 ever. They take a 1 0 lead. 75 th minute, iran, corner kick, down 1 0 , another
 to tie the game 1 -1 now in stoppage time angola with a free cook, huge chance
 for the win. Antonio mendanka misses. Ends in a 1 -1 tie. >> 10 th minute, a
 nice move, first world cup goal of his career. 20 th minute. Still 1 0 , ilyich
 another goal. Serbia 0 montenegro with a 2 0 lead after that. The score in this
 currently is 2 -1 lowry jeff weaver >> no barry bonds in the line-up today. >>

 next guest was one of the top third basemen in his generation, helped the mets
 win a pennant. An inaugural inductee to the new college baseball hall of fame.
 three-time all-american at college play. Robin ventura. How are you -1 >> i'm
 great. >> you have a little air conditioning. >> yes, it is hot here. I forgot
 about that. They didn't tell me that. >> congratulations on being a college
 baseball hall of famer. >> thank you very much. It is great. >> you have not
 been in omaha in some time, right -1 >> no, i haven't been here since 1987 it
 has changed quite a bit. They have a whole atmosphere out here that i don't
 remember actually. They have people selling things and they have kids doing a
 bunch of stuff here. >> what was your experience with oklahoma state in the
 college world series 1987 >> it was great. I think the first time you come here
 is one 1987 1987 it is the first time a college baseball player against the
 experience like a final four because all eight teams are here and they are
 playing one after another pretty much. So if you are second game you have to
 wait for the first to end and you hear all the excitement in the first game and
 want to get in there and play. In is the first time on the field is probably
 the most exciting time. >> you had that 58 58 game hitting streak. We are
 looking at that on our graphic. How aware were you of that hitting streak 58
 when did you become aware of it 58 >> i think about 30 games people start
 mentioning it. Back then we didn't have a lot of tv or people following us. But
 about the middle 30 s tv and the print media started following it a little bit
 so you took notice. We didn't think it would be that big a deal but it turned
 out a little bit of a story when we got hear. >> that was over one season 30
 you played that many games 30 >> i think we played about 72 games. So, i had it
 through pretty much the end of the season. >> did you finish the season with it
 72 72 >> no, it ended here. Mcmcdowell. Then i had to play on his team. He
 ended it here. But it was fun. It was a neat time and it was a fun deal even
 though it ended here. It was a great experience. >> what is it like for guys
 showing up there, even now guys are high draft picks, it may be it for others.
 whats it like wondering if you can get to the next level 72 >> either way it
 exciting. You are going to be here and your game is on tv. Espn has done a
 great job. They are the big reason that baseball has become so big, college
 baseball. And whether you are getting drafted or just showing up to play you
 are excited. Hopefully you win. But the main thing is you are here and you made
 to the last eight. But it is exciting as if you are picked in the first two
 rounds or not drafted. >> there are so many prospects if somebody said what
 should i be aware of, what is the biggest difference between even pro baseball,
 league baseball and college baseball 72 >> this is the last time it is for fun
 as far as the way you felt when you were a kid. Once you get in the major
 leagues everybody wants a job and wants to move up so it is a lot different. In
 guys have their positions and they kind of interchange a little bit. Guys play
 more than two positions and you are playing for your school so it is different.
 you get up there it is more cutthroat and whoever produces keeps going. >> you
 are a former yankee and roger clemens is coming back. Following that 72 >> yes,
 is not doing bad in the major leagues. Doing well. I hope he makes it up there.
 i think they will call him up for tomorrow night. >> really 72 i'm shocked. >>
 he is 43 , he will be 44 this summer. What are your thoughts on his longevity
 44 >> it is amazing. He is the only one that knows how to do that. Obviously
 preparation is the biggest factor for him. He has all the talent in the world,
 but if his heart and head were not in it he couldn't do it and it there. That
 why it took him so long. >> the all-star game will determine home field in the
 world series again. What are your thoughts on that 44 >> well, i think it makes
 interesting. I was involved in the one that was a tie and it raised a lot of
 controversy. So, it is nice to have something on the line. I think guys, you
 know, go in there knowing there's a purpose and i think that fans will enjoy
 that that they know something is riding on it. >> did you go back to when it
 mattered, when 44 44 i don't want to say hatred but when there was an edge to
 the all-star game 44 >> when i played 44 i don't know if there was a hatred but
 know 1992 it was pretty important. I think tom kelly gave as you speech that
 was beating the national league and there were some older guys that it
 mattered, they learned from the guys before and guys care. It is one of those
 things that i wasn't available to pitch in 2002 so they couldn't finish that
 game. >> you might have been available. Congratulations again on going into the
 baseball hall of fame. Lubbock, texas. Are you going 2002 >> yes, july 4 th. I
 will see if week beat the heat here. >> good talking to you. >> thanks, brian.

 >> the darkest time was in 2000 , october 3 , 2000 , making that announcement
 that i wouldn't be playing basketball again. That was probably one of the
 darkest moments. I was on such a high at that point in my life because we had
 just come back from sydney, australia and won a gold medal and traveled back
 for the birth of my daughter. I was on a high at that time. I was on top of the
 and it all just went crashing down when i heard that news. Going through 2000
 2000 i read this book a while ago and this was a quote from frederick douglas
 saying the road to success has many obstacles, and you go through adversity and
 have gone through my share of it throughout my life. And the good thing about
 going through those things, it is just making me stronger, made me more
 determined to not succumb but to overcome and i give god all the praise, i
 truly do, because without him just giving me life again, just giving me an
 opportunity to live, and just to experience this moment, this particular moment
 i got my cousin here and he's the one that donated the kidney to me. And i
 can't 2000 2000 words can't explain how grateful i am to him. I owe my life to
 him for just saving me. Because i remember, you know, lying in the hospital and
 like a newborn baby, truly helpless, in a lot of pain and helpless and just to
 have my strength again, you know. And a long time ago i told somebody, you know
 i would trade everything, all the money, all the material things, all the
 success, i would trade all of that in the world for my health right now. My
 health is so important to me. And without your health you can't live a life
 productively and not just do for yourself but do for your family. And it makes
 me appreciate living every moment now even more. And i want to share that with
 as many people as possible because i know i have been given a second chance and
 know that happened for a reason. And the only way to share that particular
 situation is to continue to try to lift other people up in the process, and
 those who are going through any type of illness, those who, you know, are going
 transplantation and having to deal with those physical obstacles, you need some
 of encouragement, some hope. I needed that. I got a call from lance armstrong.
 he texted me after game five and we had again playing phone tag and he spoke to
 mom and told me happy father's day and he called me before the series started,
 he said that even his heart, even though his heart is in texas he wants to see
 me win. And a lot of you don't realize this, but he was a huge, huge
 inspiration to me in my whole recovery period. I read both of his books after
 my surge, both of them. Lying in the hospital i was reading his second book.
 and the first book was extremely inspiring to me. And i think about what he had
 go through and being on his death bed and i said if he can do it, man, i can do
 and the way i looked at him, i know that there are thousands of other people
 that look at me the same way and i want to be here to provide them with the
 hope to overcome and not succumb to it. Because all you need is a little help
 and encouragement. Some people not, may not see me as human because of the
 things i to on the court, i laugh, i cry. I'm affected by some of the things
 you may right write or say. I'm human. And what drives me is my faith and my
 faith in knowing i'm going to be all right. And i know that 2000 2000 and i
 have told plenty of people this. That kidney patients and transplant patients
 deal with all types of sicknesses and illnesses, i had gentleman approach mae
 yesterday who was dealing with physical problems telling me how much i'm an
 inspiration to him and i told him plainly, you know what, the key to you
 recovering is keeping this right, keeping your mind right. Because if you keep
 this positive and strong, then your body is going to follow it. I never gave up
 here. I never gave up up here, and i think i credit a great deal of my recovery
 that because i never gave up up here. To so many people are quick to give up
 saying why me not realizing it a whole lot of people have it worse regardless
 of how bad you have it, everybody has problems. So regardless of how bad you
 have it somebody has it worse. Think about that. Sit back and think about that.
 is what drives me. >> amazing story. Alonzo mourning, kidney transplant, comes

 to rub shoulders with the likes of the coaching staff and some of the other
 players that will be filtering in during the course of the day from other games
 are transpiring that day from the major league season. So, i think it is a big
 game for these guys. It gets their juices flowing, gets them more excited about
 it is like to play at the big league level. >> besides getting in some bus
 rides what does it do to get get into a high profile game 9 >> i think it will
 lift their spirits. When you are chosen for a game such as this stature i think
 is pretty much enhancing one's chances of making it to the major league level.
 these are top prospects. They are not just picking anybody. It's an honor to be
 for this game and a big deal. And i think that the players go into it thinking
 that way. You mentioned some past players that have been in the game that have
 really excelled at the major league level. So i think these kids will be
 excited. I think you will see a great game. And i look forward to just being
 part of it and being able to manage them. >> you have a lot of guys all the top
 most of the top players. Gary, what about you 9 you are in the florida state
 league for the mets. You want to move up, don't you 9 you are not just i'm a
 hall of famer. You want to move up, right 9 >> well, exactly. I think that
 everyone's desire once you get back in the coaching ranks and last year was my
 first fullier getting back into it as a full-time commitment i was a roving
 catching instructor for the mets four years prior but i kind of had a game
 plan. When i retired in 1992 as a player with the expos and years later had the
 of being inducted into cooperstown, i wanted to be there for my family and i
 had the opportunity of coaching my middle daughter in high school, saw her play
 florida state where she excelled there. I got the chance to see my eldest
 daughter play tennis. She was on a scholarship at stanford. I saw my son
 involved in school plays. Then finally i got the chance, once the kids are
 basically out of the house because the youngest is 21 21 21 i'm aging myself
 but i really enjoyed the managing part of it last year if the gulf coast
 league. Then the mets offered me the double-a job in binghamton and i chose
 this position because it is close to home being that i still reside in palm
 beach gardens in florida. So it has been a great experience but ultimately,
 yes, i would like to get back to the big leagues as a manager and hopefully
 lead a team one day it a world series title. >> gary carter, not resting on the
 nice laurels but why rest. We look forward to seeing you in pittsburgh. We
 appreciate your time. >> thanks. And same to you. Always a pleasure. Love
 limping to you and obviously on espn. God bless you, too, my friend. >> gary
 carter. That is july 9 4 :00 eastern. When we come back we have players who
 played in this game. >> scruven morneau where would you go for a delicious
 panini hot off the grill 4 how about your microwave 4 try a corner bistro
 panini from stouffer's. Cooked on a revolutionary grilling tray, they're the
 only panini that actually grill to perfection... In your microwave. For a

 panini... And see what's cooking at stouffer's. W. H 4 >> morneau sends one
 deep to left-center field, and justin morneau has put the twins back in front
 on the first pitch of the 10 th. >> the twins have won eight in a row. Saw him
 there. Justin morneau. Brian kinney here. How are you 10 >> pretty good. >> you
 are doing better. Let's talk about the futures game. We talked to gary carter.
 you played in that game, right 10 >> i got to play twice. The first time was a
 little more exiting than the second time. It was a good time. >> you are not
 supposed to go twice, are you 10 >> it's not one of tse things that you kind of
 about. It is a god experience. >> it is great and you are locked in now. So it
 is fine. But what was the game like 10 what do you remember about it 10 >> the
 first one in milwaukee was an awesome experience. I think i was 1 -3 and first
 time playing in a big league tame you are around all the other prospects and
 you see the guys then you run into them later in the big leagues and you have
 that thing in common and you know each other and it is pretty fun. I got to
 stay for the home run derby. Didn't get to stay for the game but it is an
 experience you never forget. >> what is going right for you -3 that is great by
 way. Looking at the players that played with you in that game. An all-star
 game. Great to get out for that weekend. What is going right for you guys now
 given that you struggled the first two months -3 what is turning it around -3
 >> we are getting hitting and pitching at the same time. At times we would be
 hitting and not pitching or we would be pitching and not score. Now we've got
 some confidence going and if we are down late we feel like we can come back and
 bullpen has been great and the starting pitching has been great and we are
 getting the timely hits now and we are having fun playing again. >> how do you
 do that individually -3 because you are tearing it up right now, you slumped a
 i will earlier. You must wrestle with this. How do you keep in the zone -3 >>
 well, you kind of find something that feels good and try to keep doing it. I
 got a little confidence back with the home stand i felt something good and try
 to do that every day and it has been rolling since then. You get up there and
 get a big hit the first time and the next time you don't. As much pressure. One
 those things that is contagious. The whole line-up has been hitting better. It
 just fun to come to the park now. >> what was it that you did -3 >> i was
 trying to keep my weight back a little back more. I was getting fooled on
 off-speed stuff and everything looked like it was the same speed and my head
 was probably moving toward the ball and i tried to stay back and started
 hitting hard everywhere and it just kind of clicked there and i have been
 trying to do the same thing every day since. >> you come up being seen as the
 future elite power hitter of this organization. What is it like dealing with
 expectations like that -3 it's one of those things, most power hit, they don't
 really think of themselves as power hitters. Just coming up i didn't hit too
 many home runs until i was at triple-a. I was hitting more for average and i
 hit home runs more the way i looked at it but definitely something we need in
 minnesota. I think we have not had 30 home runs since 1987 it not big to me. It
 what i play for. I'm here to help us get back to the playoffs. But it will be
 nice in somebody does it just so we can stop a talking about it. >> you and joe
 expected to be the heart. He is hitting 0.38 0 0 >> he is amaze. I don't think
 he has gone hitless in back-to-back games and probably not swung at more than 0
 25 balls all season. He waits fell they throw a strike and when they do it
 seems like he gets a hit. It is fun to see a guy that relaxed, that young and
 just never seems to be rattled, never seems like he is off balance. He is one
 of the best hitters in the league. >> do you look at other guys' numbers. Do
 you say joe, you are 0.381 0.381 >> yes, more everybody else's numbers. You
 don't really look at your own too much. But it is one of those things you look
 up and he is leading the league and he is 23 and the same guy that if he was
 hitting 0.28 0 he's real composed and just a good teammate. >> you get roger
 clemens tomorrow night. What are your thoughts 0 >> i have never faced him
 before. I'm looking forward to it. We have a good pitcher going for us and it
 should be a good match-up. It is something we can talk about for a long time.
 he is definitely of hall of famer and it is one of those things we don't get to
 houston too many times so maybe my only chance to face him. >> when he made the
 he was coming back we knew it would be the 22 nd against the twins. Did you
 follow that 22 were you aware it would come against you 22 >> yes, as soon as
 it was on espn we saw that they kind of scheduled it that he would have three
 minor league starts and the first start was against us and everyone got
 excited, one of those big games, will be sold out and he is a big game primp
 and one of those things that regular season game but should have a playoff kind
 atmosphere. Should be a lot of fun. >> do you face your own pitchers ever 22 in
 or anything 22 do you ever face them in live b.p. Or anything 22 >> during
 spring training we face them getting ready for the games and they are getting
 their arms ready. They are both nasty and at home i usually stand in on the
 prisons when they warm up. I'm glad they are on my team. Their stuff is nasty.
 they throw hard and their sliders, both sliders are nasty and santana's
 change-up, i'm glad i don't have to face him. How good do you think liriano is
 22 >> he can be as good as santana. If we have them in the rotation they are
 god. He throws hard. He can get up to 96 or 97 but he has a nasty slider,
 change-up. If he can spot his stuff up a little more like santana he can be one
 the best in the league. >> before we go, what do you want in your career 97 you
 on the precipice now, becoming an all-star level player. What do you want to do
 your career 97 >> i just want to win a world series. That's the only thing i
 want to do. All the rest of the stuff, perform numbers i don't look at it too
 much. I want to maybe the only thing i would like to be known as a player like
 larry walker coming from canada one of the best out of canada but that's one of
 things down the road. First i have to get my second full year in the big league
 i can worry about that. If i can be compared to larry walker that would be a
 real compliment. >> absolutely. Thank you so much, jump. Justin morneau of the
 minnesota twins. When we come back one lucky slugger to another. I'd like to
 make a toast. Through thick and thin, this town showed grit. 97 crowd cheers 97
 took 77 of us to build the roller rink. Crowd: ooh 77 i remember stump mahoney,
 gusperson, rowand gilbert. Joe claw, bobby bernstein. Then there was jimmy
 haas. Introducing the coors light cold wrap label. Insulated to help protect
 the cold from the heat of your hand. 'cause sometimes, beer needs to stay
 colder longer. John cloxton. There was clayton volf-- let's see, who else 77 >>
 is the 2 -2 delivery, into right, that is the one, way back, goodbye, home run,
 dunn, reds win. >> that was last wednesday, 11 th inning, two on, no score, one
 the top sluggers in major league baseball tied for fourth in the national
 league in home runs. One of the top 20 in slugging. Get ready for the mets
 tonight. Joins us live on the hot list. Brian kinney here. How are you, adam 20
 i'm good. >> what was that like after nearly 11 scoreless innings what is it
 like to end a game like that 11 you don't get paid for extra innings. Good that
 swing can end it. >> you got beat up there. Is that like a thing with your team
 >> yes, they try to be violent. I'm usually the punching bag. People like scott
 feel like they have to pick on the big guy. >> you are the money man. They
 can't hurt you. >> no, they can't. But they try. >> they shouldn't. How
 important is it for you to stay within striking distance of the cards. You got
 off to a good start. >> it is huge. With pujols out we feel like we can make up
 but they are playing well and it seems like we are playing good then we will
 hit a little funk. But hopefully we can win some games and make up ground. >>
 you are a pretty versatile team. You could may in a couple of spots. Ryan freel
 around. Ken griffey comes back. What is the feeling of this team this year 11
 we are getting great pitching and we know we are going to score some runs and
 the offense hasn't been carrying our part of the bargain but it is a long
 season and this is the first time in a long time we feel like if we are in it
 our front office and management and stuff will get the people that we need. >>
 what went into your decision to re-sign 11 >> i love it. I love it here and i
 think that with the new ownership and people that we have, all they do is
 preach winning and it is obvious just the moves they made , picking up broken
 von and bran ton phillips and david ralston and juan castro. The moves have
 been ones that helped us a bunch. >> walks, strikeouts, home runs, you get a
 lot of things. Describe your approach to batting. >> i don't do a lot of things
 i strike out a lot, walk a lot and hopefully hit a lot of home runs. But i
 swing hard. >> do you ever think of modifying, i wonder what would happen if i
 tried to be a batting average guy 11 do you ever think of changing the approach
 >> i just try to hit the ball hard and when i do it goes out and when i do i
 strike out. So, i guess you have to take the good with the bad. >> do you have
 circumstances where you expand the zone 11 you have r.b.i. Situations 11 do you
 the same zone and say we need more base runners or do you sometimes expand 11
 >> that's when i get in trouble expanding the strike zone, trying to be too
 aggressive with runners in scoring position and of getting a pitch to hit. I'm
 still learning. I'm still fairly young and still learning the game. >> you made
 the mlb futures game in 2001 when they announced the rosters. What was that
 game like for you 2001 >> that was exciting. That was really my first real
 experience of an all-star game and that was fun and i would encourage people to
 it. >> where were you when you got pulled up 2001 >> i was in triple-a when i
 got call up 2001 2001 >> but for this futures game. >> i think i was in
 double-a. I don't remember. I don't know. >> is that the point though where it
 was still kind of a shock to get up to play in a big league park are were you
 on the verge of being called up any way 2001 >> i think i was 2001 2001 maybe i
 called up a week after that. But it was my first experience in a big league
 park and it was safeco and that was a great park to see. One of the newer ones.
 you get to meet a lot of top guys. Do you remember the guys that played on your
 and against you 2001 >> yes, i remember some of them. I don't remember a lot of
 but i remember a few of them and we still run in each other. >> this just came
 up again, you will be part of this more than likely the all-star game
 determines home feld in the world series. The owners voted to keep that going.
 do you like that 2001 >> i don't think that that should be part of home field
 advantage. Who wins the exhibition game. But whatever they decide is fine with
 me. >> adam dunn getting ready for the mets. He is at shea. We thank you for
 your time. Good talking with you. >> all right, brian. Thanks. >> when we come
 back the top stories. 0 0 hey, what's up, roger 0 0 hey, stu. What's up 0 hey,
 a supplier gave me these. And i figured if anybody could use them, you could.
 oh yeah, that's nice. Thanks. Uh, i don't know if they're any good or not. 0

 0 laughing 0 yeah. It's funny, huh 0 real funny. And elvin hayes has picked up
 number 4 motta is screaming. He is lucky he didn't get a t. >> johnson goes the
 webster on the follow. Jack sikma. Johnson. Knocked away. It has been caught
 again by the sonics. And that is 39 webster has brought the house alive and
 seattle, back. Trying to slow things down immediately which he does. Trying to
 calm down the sonics. Athens they are ahead, this is a thunderous response
 fwourlts. Elvin hayes. He quiets the crowd. Big, big basket. >> that's the
 greatest way in the world to quite them down in the road. Charlie johnson
 forearmed knack jack that time. Called for the foul. Three fouls on johnson. >>
 asking for it. Bringing it back to young sikma. Short. Williams hustles for the
 goes again. And the lead is at 6 7 :45 left in the third period of game 7
 unseld lobs for hayes. 7 whistle 7 >> dandridge was coming into the middle and
 it be counts. And wilkins can't believe it. >> another example of moving the
 ball tolt weak side, giving the man an opportunities opportunity to go 1 -1 16
 points for bobby d. Who is a free agent, picked up by the bullets. He respected
 biggest cash outlay in preparation for this season. Bobby had not played for
 very good on the road in playoff competition but he is having a good game here.
 is when you need him most. >> hayes missing the turn around. Back on defensive.
 johnson firing the ball to guess williams. Short. Marvin webster coming back
 and an assist. That is his fourth personal foul and melvin hayes. >> the shot
 taken, marvin webster up for the rebound, getting a little bit of elvin hayes,
 right over his back. >> so we have a timeout. Sonics trying regroup around
 lenny wilkens with washington in command. >> a hard play by sikma that time.
 that's his first basket in his last eight attempts also. >> and it is much.
 second year out of north carolina. >> buddy brown to the attack. Stole by
 dandridge. >> not a very good shot in that situation. Should try to work
 around, run some kind of oves, not go one-on-one and take a 20 20 foot jump
 shot. >> henderson trying to come around the corner that time. Gus williams has
 picked up foul number 5 and dennis johnson quickly checks in with guess going
 out. >> and guess, his last score attempt in the game. Johnson over 12 in the
 game. Sikma 1 -8 so 3 of the 7 or 10 that they have are having very poor
 offensive games here in evening. >> couldn't have a more inopportunity time to
 have that happen. >> we have a 20 20 second injury timeout. It was for tommy
 henderson who sprained his left hand somewhat. The washington trainer tended to
 and tommy back at the free-throw line, checking the clock. 1 :51 left in the
 third period. A nine-point bullet lead. >> and you have got to think that
 unseld is saying tonight is the night. He has waited so long for had a
 championship and he is on the brink. >> letting some of the air that time,
 draupping the foul. Watching intently to see if the field goal is going do go
 down and unseld quickly checking the clock. Calmly half blowing a bubble. >>
 trying to go against tremendous odds having to win two games up near seattle to
 the championship. Not many medium thought they could do that but they are
 trying to proof people wrong and they are doing a good job of it so far. >> the
 celtics won three games in milwaukee the last time that the series went seven
 games and the last time that a road team won the desighsive game. >> when you
 get to the last game, you don't think too much about a home court advantage. >>
 coming back. So in the 10 points, the bullets lead. They come down with
 henderson. Dandridge, west, criss-crossing his forwards now. Rotating
 underneath. Ud outside and short. Marvin webster. Knowing that he is going to
 have to contain webster down the stretch because as freddy brown said at
 halftime, they must go inside. Dandridge for 3 >> excellent defense bullpen the
 have the response. >> they are refusing to crack. Holding up under tremendous
 pressure and odds. >> dandridge from the past and it's henderson with dennis
 johnson coming in. Johnson the foul and henderson down and injured. >> freddie
 is ok pngs he was more upset about missing the basket i believe than anything
 else on this play. Dennis grabbing up to make sure he doesn't hurt him. A good
 sportsman like gesture on his part. A little bit disappointed that he didn't
 make the shot. >> that's how he makes him feel even worse. >> any time you miss
 free-throw line 3 3 free-throw in a championship game, it really hurts, rick.
 >> it hurts me to miss them any time. >> he got position. That is 4 -4
 participant game's biggest lead. At the buzzer. Johnson puts one in -4 so
 johnson has hit one from mid-court as time runs out on the third period. So
 they have had a response for everything. Including the clock running down. The
 washington bullets are 12 minutes away from capturing the championship. >> it
 was this shot by charles johnson that made it 79 -66 rick fk not quite as long
 or dramatic as jerry west against the new york knicks, but they are doing quite
 thank you. >> yes, it does. Putting that much more pressure on the sonics
 wondering what is going on out here -66 we can't seem to get any breaks. But
 they have got 12 minutes to work hard, they have the crowd behind them. >> 26
 off the bench and the bullets have suddenly come up with more depth than they
 had when the series began. Short. >> freddy brown. Wright was scrambling. 26
 whistle 26 >> and the whistle. Bobby dandridge. >> they should be moving the
 ball around a little bit more. The bullets keeping the pressure on. This is how
 can win the championship with their defense. >> the buments shooting so much
 better during the third period. It's 12 e. 12 12 it's 11 >> still a long way to
 there is a ten densey to let up sometimes when you are ahead, but don't go
 away. >> charles johnson. >> have i said that many time before, jack will play
 the same regardless of what the situation is. >> he is also most valuable
 player for most 11 11 most valuable player for the series. Jack sikma. >> into
 the good pass. Again, turnovers, they can can rebound so costly. Every trip
 down the floor for the sonics is big. Sikma faces up. >> he has hit his last
 five shots. Johnson is in the corner. Ballard gets it back and johnson with the
 clock running out. Down by freddy brown. Sonics trying to get a running game
 going. Brown, nobody is on deck. 81 -74 we will have a time out called by dick
 motta. >> he knows that the pass, that move and trying to hold the sonics off.

 and kupchak over to assist him. >> he was the man that put his body on the
 line, bounced to kupchak and you can see the reaction. In situations like that,
 best thing just dive on top of that ball and smother it. >> dick motta with tom
 down. 12 points for kupchak. He is 5 -6 with five rebounds. And he made it 100
 -94 >> to second-guess yourself. Henderson did a great job of just keeping the
 ball alive. >> the sonics, john, it h. Every opportunity to come out of there
 with the basketball and they couldn't handle it. >> they played good defensive.
 johnson had to take a 20 , 25 25 footer. >> here again, webster had a piece of
 ball with the active hand and really gets it well. >> they will see what they
 can do with the last one one minute and 30 seconds and the bullets leading by 6
 100 -94 >> and kupchak at the three-point shot line attempting to complete the
 three-point play. >> marvin webster with five fouls. Thele penalty. >> freddy
 brown, coming up and a foul called on his shot attempt. Bobby dandridge. >>
 freddy brown really looking to the offensive. This is his game right now
 because i don't think there is anyone else out there that thinks he can do
 that. This time he picked up a foul in the process. He has a chance to complete
 shots here and cut the lead again. >> four fouls on bobby d. Freddy brown has
 experience among usually problems for him at the free-throw line of this
 series. >> 5 u9 and the bullets with the ball. >> they want to use up as much
 time as possible. They are going to bring the clock down as far as they can. >>
 rejected, webster and c.j. Is off. It will go to the sonics. 5 whistle 5 >> >>
 101 -95 , i would think john havlickek, just as you pointed out, they will go
 to freddy brown and dick motta will instruct the bullets to be ready for that.
 >> you can be sure he will get a few picks on this sequence. Here again,
 bullets not electing to put pressure prer on the man out of bounds. All he has
 to do is turn and face it, he has a lot of time to pick out the man. This is a
 crucial situation, put a man on the person taking the ball out of bounds. It is
 under a lot of heavy pressure to make the attack. >> brown comes out to meet
 him. >> they cannot waste time. Kupchak goes down in an effort to draw the
 foul. And 101 -97 >> he has that uncanny ability to the get people in the air,
 and get between them. Good shot. He can shoot it offbalance. >> ahead by 4 ,
 the nba championship at stake here. >> dandridge, marvin webster 4 4 webster,
 helping out with the pressure. Dandridge brings it up, across the time line.
 using the clock, going to henderson. Shot clock down to 10 10 whistle 10 >>
 sonics finally go for the foul. Jack sikma in the corner. >> in the corner,
 away from the ball. We will see how the gamble pays off. >> so there indeed is
 the timeout. 26 26 seconds. Sonics down by four points. And of course as soon
 as this championship is determined, we will take you inside the winning locker
 room and have the presentation of the trophy. 26 whistle 26 >> so it has come
 down to the last 26 seconds, of game 7 itself seattle supersonics trailing
 itself washington bullets 101 -97 >> i'm sure you will see them going to freddy
 again and when the shot is taken, there will be five speem crashing the boards.
 whistle -97 >> it begins. Freddy brown. In and out -97 and the rebound back up
 and in by paul silas with 18 seconds. It's a 2 2 point lead. Pressure now,
 unseld goes to henderson 2 whistle 2 >> wilkins saying no foul but unseld was
 picked up in the back court. Paul silas. Lenny had check the clock and he
 preferred to wait until they came across the line. But silas was over to
 unseld. Unseld, 0 -2 , his last time to the foul line. >> he will be shooting 3
 because the foul was in the back court. >> the last free-throw. >> making up a
 mighty important one. It's a 3 3 point lead. >> the sonics have one time out
 left, i believe and they are going to use that as soon as this play is
 completed. >> so it is 102 -99 , and the tension begins to build in the
 coliseum as time is running out on the supersonics. >> wes unseld will be
 coming to the free-throw line to shoot had the penalty. >> this may very well
 be the biggest free-throw line wes has ever shot. >> >> making it a four-point
 bullet lead. Leading with the right foot, calming coming back after missing
 three in a row and hitting those two important ones. Which put the bullets up
 by 4 and 12 seconds to go. So, wes unseld, who in 1971 failed as the super of
 the baltimore bullets when they were blown out by kareem in the milwaukee bucks
 straight games, and who failed again in 1975 when the golden state warriors
 beat the walker bullets by four straight is just 12 ticks of the clock away
 from his first nba championship. And for dick motta, it all began back in utah,
 to grace idaho where he failed to make his high school team. Went in the air
 force and game back as coach. Moved up to varsity and a state championship.
 flaherty became appear successful head coach pat weave remember state and from
 there, a man by the name of dick kline gave him his opportunity to become head
 coach of the chicago bulls. Four times he led the bulls to 50 50 plus
 victories, one time going to the championship game of the western conference.
 and now, as head coach of the washington bullets, dick motta is about to turn
 to that famous front lady of his and say ok, light it up, we have got it done.
 but 12 seconds and a lot of strange things can happen in the nba. Hear is the
 man, lenny wilkens, came out to be the number 1 contrast choice of the st.
 louis hawks in 1960 traded from atlanta to seattle and became a player-coach of
 supersonics. Later traded away to cleveland. Longed to become the head coach of
 portland trailblazers and had only one misfortune tune. He couldn't prosecute
 keep bill walton healthy. He has come to seattle supersonics this year, he too,
 seconds away but for lenny wilkens, it's a longer 12 seconds. Ball silas will
 take the ball out of the bounds. It's been a whale of a campaign. It is in and
 out. With the call. It is about to end. Bobby dandridge. He will be our most
 valuable player. Voted as most valuable player here, the nba championship
 series fantasy celebrations begin in washington. The washington bullets file
 off the floor and the crowd here in seattle, comes to its feet and gives both
 the teams a tremendous ovation. >> freddy brown and united states 12 12 unseld
 shaking hands at mid-court. They didn't think the theme would get into the
 playoffs. And for the washington bullets, they have finally done it and done it
 hard way. They twice had to win games here in seattle, one in the king dome
 before 39 ,000 fans and here tonight in the seattle center coliseum where the
 supersponics had won 42 straight games. And the washington buments, 105 -99 ,
 the final score as they file into their locker room. The happy champions of the
 and the most valuable player bobby dandridge. The rookie as they eliminated
 atlanta. -99 inaudible -99 -99 inaudible -99 -99 inaudible -99 >> again, they
 had given up the home court but they take it away tonight as they have won the
 nba championship. 0 >> we have a happen by >> we have good news for you, you
 were voted mmple v.p. Bobby, you played a fine all-around series. That's the
 one thing we remarked about, you play both ends of the floor. >> i've enjoyed
 this season as much as i've enjoyed any season in my life. I hope this is just
 the beginning of a great career in washington. >> all right, bobby, thank you
 very much. Let's get somebody else. Greg. A young man here who we talked a lot
 about. Another good job out here, you've got a fine future, how does it feel to
 on a championship team in your first year. >> it feels great. I'm proud. I'm
 definitely proud of the veterans, they did one heck of a job throughout the
 series, starting with atlanta and san antonio, philadelphia, and now the
 seattle supersonic, they were tough. Give all the credit to the sonics, they
 are one tough team. >> thanks a lot, super job. We'll try to get more players
 in here as we can. The important people we want to talk to, wes unseld, mitch
 kupchak, only over here. Another young man playing only the second year in the
 nba, you've been on good ball clubs in college, how does it feel here 0 >> in
 college we just couldn't win the finals, but this is great. Everybody did a
 great job. Between montreal and college, this takes it. >> i think you're
 downgradingor performness in the king dome, i think you single handedly carried
 along and said, fellows, we can win this. >> it's nice to hear something luke
 that, but it's a team effort. It's cliche, but it's great. It's been a long
 season, but we all did it together. >> you had a ring, i got the ring, this is
 what it's all about. It's a tremendous feeling to win all of this time, all
 these games, all of these year, this is what it's all about. >> i sympathize.
 the biggest game of your career, you had to sit on the bench. I think you
 handled it well. >> you know, a lot of fouls is bad, but either you see the
 guys go out there and go get it like that and you know there's nothing you can
 do while you're on the bench, but to get it and know you have it and they can't
 it now. >> great going and continued success to you. Let's go to the trowtrow
 if i presentation. >> the commissioner of the nba, laurence o'bryan is here
 with special guests and commissionering why don't you present the trophy. >> i
 will. First of all, i think that we should commend the seattle supersonics for
 a great series also. This is one of the great series of all time in the nba.
 and it was played right down to the wire. We could all be proud of the
 supersonics of course tonight. I'm very happy to be here with jerry sacks, bob
 ferry, our coach, dick motta, and wes unseld, who has been waiting a while for
 all of this i want to tell you that tonight, the washington bullets have
 reached the peak of world basketball. And they are the world champions as of
 tonight and i want now to present the world championship trophy to them and i
 also want to express a word for a fellow who is still trying to reach us, owner
 the washington bullets, there he is now. Abe, come on over here. >> here comes
 the owner. Abe, how happy you've got to be. >> 15 years i've waited. >> i won't
 you wait another second, if i can lift this and present it to you, here's the
 world championship trophy to the washington bullets, champions of the world. 15
 15 >> fantastic. Beautiful. Fantastic. >> abe accepting the trophy for having
 won the championship, dick motta, i know what a moment this is for you. >> it's
 a long time, but it was worth it. Seattle played a great series, i thought it
 was a heck of a basketball series. I hated to see it end. I think the fat lady
 is going to sing in washington, d.c. From now on. >> all right, dick motta and
 the washington bullets have accepted the trophy, they have won the world
 championship. >> we are the champions of the world "you're pretty, waiting long
 " "yeah, and i'm late" "no car, huh 15 " "uh, uh" "bad credit" "i got a car..."

 after a long and glorious run, it seemed 1969 might bring the fall of the
 celtic dynasty. Weakened by age and injury, bost finished fourth in the east in
 regular season, but rallied in the playoffs to make it back to the nba finals.
 they were heavy underdogs with a powerful l.a. Laker team with elgin baylor and
 johnson. The teams battled through six games, and today we bring you the forth
 quarter of the sixth game. >> 91 -76 , the largest lead held by the celtics in
 this game. >> the interesting thing to me, we see hopkins get the tip and drive
 they're very fresh. We're going into the fourth period, the lakers are standing
 more and seem to be more tired than the celtics. >> am jones, 35 years old,
 playing like a 25 25 year-old. >> he's got the hot hand, that's trouble for the
 lakers only hit 28 28 in that third quarter. I think it's due to the alert
 defense of the boston celtics. >> jones, who had 24 points, has wrestled, tried
 say that the in line, john egan called for the three play. >> we've seen the
 depth of the celtics, lakers came out in the shutout, donn nelson, havlicek,
 when you shut out jerry west and elgin baylor, seldom do you see the other
 three pick up the scoring slack. 24 whistle 24 >> hawkins. A wild hook shot.
 let's see if sam jones 24 24 it is. Jones now with five personals. Sam jones
 with five. Siegfried will replace jones. You look at wilt chamberlain with five
 >> sam's fouls not nearly as critical as wilt chamberlain's fifth foul. 24
 whistle 24 >> fouled from behind. Three on egan. If you just joined us, boston
 led at the end of the first, 28 -25 at halftime, 59 -56 at the end of the third
 91 -76 now it's 94 -78 , 18 points for bryant. >> the celtics with that big
 lead, oftentimes the intent is to blow it up, sit on the lead, work the 24 24
 second clock with the good shot. They didn't get that lead by holding it up.
 elgin baylor driving across the middle. >> 94 -80 whistle. Six points for bill.
 bill russell, age 35 , playing in his 101 st game this year, chris. 101 whistle
 >> and now bill russell has five personals. Sam jones with five, bill russell
 with five. For the lakers, wilt chamberlain with five. Mel counts with four.
 west to the line, looking for his 28 th point. The foul line, lakers have hit
 on 18 -34 >> chris in a situation like this, wilt chamberlain is more po tent
 offensively and more, i think better able to get the sixth personal foul on
 bill russell than bill is able to get the sixth foul on wilt chamberlain. >>
 howe into the boston lineup. 98 -81 wilt chamberlain driving on russell. You
 may see a lot of that now. >> that's what i said. The lakers now will be going
 to wilt chamberlain and wilt will be trying to foul bill out. Gone to bill's
 outside, they have that hot hand. >> bryant, 18 points. 18 whistle 18 >> and
 into the los angeles lineup, replacing johnny egan, ericson. The los angeles
 lineup has tom hawkins, jerry west, ericson, elgin baylor, and wilt
 chamberlain. For boston, havlicek puts the ball in, russell, sigh freed, and
 howe. Chamberlain with the rebound. >> chamberlain not even guarding russell. I
 we'll see the same at the other end. Bill russell completely off chamberlain.
 >> los angeles trailing by the largest margin, 17 chamberlain gets the rebound.
 rebounds for wilt. Baylor. >> you know, the lakers are throwing it up there,
 they have to make up 17 points and they've got to get that ball down quickalism
 throwing the ball up, playing in the fourth period as they were in the first
 period. >> there you see the list of players, jones, russell, chamberlain, with
 personal fouls, a lot of time left, 8 :52 remaining in this championship
 finals. Elgin baylor for los angeles. Jerry west. 8 whistle 8 >> and larry
 siegfried fouls him in the act of shooting. The second on larry. >> los
 angeles, the western division champions with 55 victories during the season,
 boston finishing fourth with 48 in the east. West with 30 points. >> 15 points,
 awful lot of points to overcome with 8 :28 left in the ballgame. The celtics
 are slowing the ball down to eat up the clock. That may give los angeles an
 opportunity to get some quick baskets. There you see them slowsing it up. Their
 is to run. >> bryant guarded by keith ericson. Knocked out by keith. Siegfried
 waiting over here in the middle as havlicek gets to him. Blocked. Chamberlain
 has the rebound. Little more than 8 :00 remaining in the game. Ericson, looking
 jerry west. Howell switches off on west. Now within 12 points. 33 points for
 west and the celtics sense trouble. With 7 :58 remaining in the fourth, here in
 forum in inglewood, california, boston 100 , los angeles, 88 not bad. What are

 lakers get life and sam in that backcourt will keep the lakers' defense honest
 defensively. >> now elgin baylor has four personals. >> i imagine bill ruzz el
 in calling that time-out discussed west quite a bit. West is the one the lakers
 go to to try to bring them back. We can expect the celtics to try to

 103 -94 >> chamberlain can't move. He's down there holding that knee. He really
 that knee on that last rebound. >> but he did get the rebound and quickly
 called for a time-out. Frank o'neill, los angeles laker trainer checking it. >>
 he's doing is putting that freon on the knee, freezes the spot that was
 twisted, not allowing it to swell. Wilt chamberlain really twisted that knee on
 rebound. This could be a big factor in the closing minutes of this game work
 him not mobile. He has five fouls and may not be able to move around quite as
 well. There you see bill russell at the other end of the floor, taking
 advantage of the time-out to rest up a little bit for the closing moments.
 russell also with five fouls. >> chamberlain with 18 points, 22 rebounds, still
 moving in toward russell as the play is started by jerry west. West guarded by

 lakers have renewed spirits with 4 :28 to go, they are within five points of

 offense. >> beginning to see the pressure now. Both teams at 4 :23 to go.

 100 men of the square table, as a culture, do we want to be remembered for this

 man law, not caveman law. Hey, have you done it 100 no 100 then you don't know
 what you're talking about 100 crushing beer cans on your forehead is wrong.
 triple h is right. Cans ain't as thick as they once were. I mean, back in the
 day, you crush a can on your forehead, you were saying something, but now--
 it's lame. You're right. You're right. Man law 100 100 together 100 man law.

 what the lakers have done in this series. Especially in the fourth period. Now
 it's egan and elgin baylor on this side. Ericson on the far side. Mel counts.
 the lakers within one point of the lead with about 3 :00 to go. >> bill russell
 not come out to guard mel counts. Counts is an excellent outside shooter,

 >> once again, the danger of having a big lead, blowing up your running game,
 having trouble here in the fourth period. >> 103 -102 2 :22 to go. >> west
 waves everybody away, he wants it by himself. >> a steal by siegfried to emmitt

 siegfried. There you see the time left,-seconds. This is it. 13 13 46 seconds.
 mel counts drives on russell. Can't get it up, russell takes it away. 34
 seconds to go. >> now at 32 sebbeds, chris, celtics can freeze out the 24 24
 second clock, get it down to seven seconds. With a three-point lead, they have
 a great advantage. >> the celtics at the beginning of this series trailed 0 -2
 , came back to tie it up, lakers then led three games to two. Boston tied it up
 at boston garden, now in the seventh game, ericson commits his sixth foul, and
 leaves the game, it's larry siegfried at the line. Ericson is replaced by
 hawkins, number one foul shooter in the nba. Now a four-point lead with 24
 seconds left. Siegfried with six point burks these are big ones. Seven points.
 now a five-point lead with 22 seconds to go, stolen by havlicek. He can nearly
 run out the clock. Over to bill russell. Foul by johnny egan. 15 seconds to go.
 by five. Fourth foul on johnny egan. And many of the los angeles fans are
 beginning to leave the forum. Bitter disappointment thus far for the owner, the
 manager, and the majority of the 17 ,560 fans. 12 seconds to go, trail big six,
 tries the shot, baylor on the rebound, fouled. Donn nelson has five and going
 to the foul line is captain elgin baylor, who may be playing his last game. 18
 points in this final tonight. Now it's 108 -103 with seven seconds. 108 -104 a
 four-point lead by boston. Seven seconds. Bill russell decides that -104 -104
 to talk it over with the players. They led by three at the end of the first
 quarter, by three at halftime, and then by 15 at the end of the third quarter,
 and at one time, celtics were on top by 17 and we've only had one tie in the
 ballgame. That was 60 -60 we offer major carriers, great plans, and

 sleeping in boston saturday night following that afternoon game, which we
 televised, while the lakers immediately after the game flew to the west coast.
 arriving in the wee hours of the morning sunday morning. And now tonight have
 had their hands full against the world champion boston celtics. So there is sam
 who fouled out. With six perms. His slack was taken up just enough, but their
 big lead was erased, as we look at john havlicek. Havlicek getting it to
 howell, and now counting off the seconds, four, three, it's a steal by johnny
 egan. And time is running out, boston sellics have done it again. Another jewel
 that crown. 108 -106 a two-point victory by boston. There you see donn nelson,
 here comes bailey howell, now tom sanders, who did not get in the lineup. Keith
 son of los angeles, a disappointed will chamberlain in hopes of bringing the
 first title in nine years to los angeles. But the boston celtics, averaging 32
 years of age, lakers 30 , and of course you'll have to say that the celtics,
 greatest sports dynasty in the history of professional athletics. Of course a
 most valuable player award will be given here tonight for the man most valuable
 the entire seven games, and jerry west has won it. Certainly a great performer,
 over 30 points, tonight another big scoring night coming thru with 42 , the
 boston celtics had their scoring pretty much spread around. And the fans down
 on the floor, and in the event of a laker victory here at the forummark, many
 balloons hang in the rafters. They will not be released, because the celtics
 have won it by two points. Since the spring of 1959 >> ok, i'm here with red
 auerbach and sam jones. Sam, congratulations what a great last game. >> it was
 tough, goes to show you, we had to win one on their home court, this was the
 bun, this was the greatest. >> sam, what a way to go out. What did you say at
 halftime to get everybody, i made the remark that late in the ballgame, you
 appeared to be more effective than the lakers. >> i knew it was my last game,
 yf to save up for next year or anything. A lot of pride, i want to thank the
 fans back home in boston. They've been wonderful. >> what about putting you
 into the ballgame, sam work eight minutes to go in the ballgame with five
 fouls, what did russ have in mind when he put you in with that much time left
 1959 >> he put me in to shoot, because we wasn't getting the ball to the hoops.
 west is one of the toughest ballplayers i've played against, i had to go out
 and play my game, i fouled out, but it felt good. >> this is probably your
 greatest win, right 1959 >> yeah. I want to say, jerry west was absolutely
 fantastic. That was one of the greatest things i've seen in my life. I tell
 you, i had to stand up every time he got the ball. >> i know bill russ sell
 right behind us, he wants you in the locker room, we're going to let you go.
 thank you very much. Red, thank you. Now let's go back up to chip. >> we're
 about halfway up, 50 feet high, away from the playing considerate, those few
 fans who were here in the land of the lakers who are boston fns are trying to
 get near the celtics, but i believe the celtics are all in the locker room.
 coach bill russell indicated he wants to close the doors so just the players
 and front office players could have a moment of relaxation and sort of savor,
 sort of soak in their 11 th world championship in 13 years. They have never
 lost in a seven game in a final playoff series. Bill russell, who has been with
 the longest, this was his 165 th playoff game in a 13 will have year career. He
 been in nine series where it went seven game, never losing. Here are the final
 statistics in this final championship game. Jerry west the most valuable player
 the series, 42 points, elgin baylor, 20 , chamberlain with 18 , egan with ,
 counts with eight, ericson with six. The celtics led by havlicek, jones,
 bryant. As for rebounds. Wilt chamberlain with 22 , bill russell with 19 and
 near the end of the game, you'll recall wilt chamberlain injured a right knee,
 taken out, replaced by mel counts who again had a fine game for the lakers, but
 was not enough. A rivalry renewed as los angeles and boston have been in the
 finals for the lasting ayears. Now the lake verse lost all six. It was right
 here in los angeles last year that the celtics won their 10 th crown and
 they've done it again. It's the first time in the history of the nba, dating
 back to 19 19 , 23 years a team has finished as low as fourth in a division to
 come on and win the title. Boston, of course, doing it as they came through
 against philadelphia in the quarterfinals, four victories to one, and in the
 semis, against tough new york, 4 -2 , while the lakers came in winning the
 western division and winning a quarter final playoff series against san
 francisco 4 -2 and the semifinals against the atlanta hawks, four games to one.
 there you see jack wall dren, the executive of -2 -2 waldren, executive of the
 company that owns the celtics. >> i'm here with bill russell. This must have
 been a great win for you. I know it's hard to say what's in your mind, this
 must have been a great win. >> this is such a great bunch of guys you know,
 it's been so great the way they played for me. It sounds corny to start talking
 that, but i told the guys, i don't care what happens, i wouldn't trade you guys
 any other guysed in the world. >> that was really obvious, leadership has to
 come from you and to bring a team from fourth place to the world title, the 11
 th title in 14 yearsering you've got the respect of everybody in the country.
 >> it's my guys. It's just my guys. These guys are such a great bunch of guys,
 i can't say enough about the guys. >> let me get john havlicek. John, send john
 here. What a great game. What do you have to say 14 >> i'm telling you, every
 time we come into this series, it seems like it gets tougher and tougher each
 year and one of these days i'm going to be able to retire and watch someone
 else sit back and work so hard to do it. What we go through is an emotional
 experience that's getting to me every year. >> john, bill, everybody,
 congratulations a great year and a great season. Now back up to chris. >> so
 there's definitely happiness in boston tonight as the final score of the
 celtics, 108 , los angeles, 106 >> with that bill russell and the celtics added
 closing chapter to their remarkable run of 11 championships in 13 years. This
 one perhaps the most satisfying of all as they sent russell, their
 player-coach, off into retirement with one more title. It also ended one phase
 of the laker-celtic rivalry. Boston had won all six of their match yulls in the
 's, lmple a. Would have to wait another 16 years before getting a measure of
 revenge when magic johnson led the showtime lakers into a victory. That's it
 for this edition of "hardwood classics." next time, use fedex.g.g. >> you're
 looking at "pistol" pete maravich, in my opinion the greatest play marek
 playing today. Great passer, great shooter a lot of people don't know this, he
 is wonderful at all these dexterity drilling. Pete, when did you start all this
 >> comes out of a system i started around six or seven years of age, homework
 basketball, it improves your quickness, coordination and your overall ability
 to handle a basketball. >> don't you get the feeling that when you're doing
 these thing, the ball becomes sort of an extension of your hand 16 >> exactly.
 that's exactly how i felt when i was growing up. I dribbled so much, so many
 different ways, learning new types to have drill to dribble with one ball, two
 balls so forth, i never really had to look at the basketball, which improved my
 from a great standpoint. >> a lot of coaches that advocate this, but they don't
 it with any application to the game itself. Now you'd be amazed at some of the
 things that pete will demonstrate to you. Pete, how about showing us a few of
 them. >> number one, i did this for quickness, just to improve my quickness, a
 ricochet drill you stand with your feet apart, throw the ball down, back and
 forth like this. This is just for coordination purposes. Once you get into the
 bullet ricochet, you try to throw the ball very hard. And catch it behind.
 that's one >> beautiful. >> another one, a very good quickness drill that i
 haven't done that much, coach, except in the summertime, the object is to put
 the ball blind your knees, clab your hands in front and catch the ball before
 it hits the ground. I don't know if i'll get it but i'll try. >> how about a
 couple of more pete 16 >> i can take two balls show a short drill which is just
 short figure eight drill using two basketballs. We call in rhythms and out
 rhythms and going around. This really increases your ability to handle
 basketballs. >> when you see a loose ball, and that ball is a couple inches
 from the ground, don't you feel real superior to the next guy, knowing that you
 start a dribble from that low position 16 >> exactly. One of the best moves i
 have, particularly as an individual, is putting the ball out in front of
 somebody, as they go for it dork what i call stutter dribble, back over like
 that >> try that again. >> you've got your hand there 16 16 >> i'm guarding
 him, i have a feeling that i might be able to get that ball burk through all
 this dexterity practice, he knows that he can beat my reaction and go by me.
 now would you advidse young players out there to do those things 16 >> a kid
 needs speed, quickness, and ability to have coordination and through these
 drills i do, particularly, it really helped my game and i can only wish that
 everybody would try to do something with the ball. What it does is gives you
 great confidence in your overall ability when you can do something a little bit
 it really helps you. >> what you've just seen has a definite purpose. Think.
 when you work at it, keep telling yourself how can this help my game 16 you can
 on it hard, knowing that this will improve your game. >> very good. I have here
 bird, everybody knows who he is, boston celtics, retrieving the ball, dennis
 johnson, premiere guard of the celtics. Larry, you're shooting a free throw,
 got to know that a free throw is a free throw. Nobody will bother you. You've
 got all the time. When you've got this time, larry to shoot the ball, what goes
 your mind 16 >> first thing is to get my eyes focused on the front of the rim.
 second thing, to get in position where i feel most comfortable at, and the
 third thing is to get my hand situated on the ball which feels best to me. I
 use the seams as a guide. The fourth thing is, i get my feet set, get down in
 position, fol through with my arm. >> you notice how he mentioned it, the
 seams. This ball is different from a college basketball, because the seams are
 a little wider. Does that help you 16 >> it does in my feel of the ball and
 getting my hands situated better. >> notice how larry said his knees are bent
 and goes up he doesn't go through ho both motions of down and then up. He's
 already down when he shoots it. Now the most important thing, shooting a shot
 of any kind, especially a free throw, he mentioned it, these things don't come
 by accident, your eye on the basket. The position of the head. Now larry, you
 always grab the seams, if i throw you the ball, automatically he'll touch the
 seams and get it and get it back. Now watch, automatically, quickly. Very good.
 more time. This is what we're talking about. The seams. Now why do you have the
 spin 16 why do people shoot that ball like that 16 great shooters. >> well
 because once the ball hits the rim, you've got the back spin on it, you can hit
 rim and it dives and bounces around you can get a better roll on it. >> that's
 why great shooters, it hits the rim, rolls around, and drops in. That's reason
 why it happens. Notice what he said, flole through. Concentration. Position of
 the hand. All the most important things, and remember, the most important thing
 all on a free throw, or a foul shot, whatever you want to call it, is that it's
 nobody is bothering you. You've got all the time in the >> from channel 4 san
 diego, this is, one-on-one. With jane mitchell. >> eric young and mike camer.
 covering ground by leaps and bounds. >> i feel like i was free again because i
 was in the field. There was nothing that could really hold me back. >> that was
 job. Get on base and use these legs. >> eric young and mike cameron, two former
 with postseason experience, are now, adding speed and sizzle to the san diego
 padres outfield and lineup. Both have also rebounded from serious injuries. Not
 because they got lucky, but because their positive energy has helped fuel their
 to get, back in the game. Eric young is, simply electric. Hustling in the
 outfield or on the base paths, he showed little sign of slowing down even at,
 39 >> i always have a lot of energy. I always, just a happy-go-lucky person. >>
 orlando young's story starts with coincidence. His birthday, may 18 th, 1967
 same date, different year as hall-of-famers reggie jackson and brooks robinson.
 admits to being a fair weather yankees and mets span growing up in new
 brunswick new jersey ere he watch ad lot of sports on tv. >> football,
 basketball, baseball i wanted to emulate the player and do some of the things
 he was doing on tv. >> who were some of the players you tried to emulate 1967
 >> more so, willie randolph. That was my favorite. I like the way willie
 carried himself. >> playing baseball first was in the neighborhood. With no
 little league for him two brothers and sister. >> growing up i thought i was in
 rich neighborhood. I got everything i wanted. Which wasn't a lot but we go the,
 had a roof. We had food, that's the way you supposed to live. But we were the
 low income neighborhood. And as we call it the ghetto. >> once joined organized
 at ten he would be consistent mvp of teams and tournaments from. A working
 class family, his parents often told him 1967 1967 >> there is someone out
 there always better than you. I didn't want anybody to be better than me. >> a
 teacher encouraged him to switch to a private catholic high school. >> she
 wanted to make sure i stay on right track. I don't necessarily think being in
 the ghetto, or going to public school would have deterred me at all. I just had
 mission on my mind. At that particular stage of my life and, i wasn't going to
 let anything or anyone get in between us. >> what was your mission 1967 >> was
 going to be successful. I was given a god-given talent. I was going to take
 advantage of it. >> still focused on getting good grades his junior year he
 returned to be with friends and cousins at public new brunswick high school,
 earning all state honors in, football, basketball and baseball. Nearby rutgers
 university offered a football scholarship. More than other colleges a chance to
 as a wide receiver his freshman year. >> and, i'm very happy i stayed home.
 very happy. >> not just for the success he would eventually have there. >> how
 did you feel about that off-season. >> but for his son 1967 >> oh, yeah. >>
 senior young high school girlfriend. Pat eric, jr.. >> i want everybody to
 understand appreciate took a real man to step up at age 18 and raise a son to
 finally, have him follow in your footsteps is probably dream come true for him.
 lot of people might have ran from that situation. You know i appreciate and
 love for him doing that for me. Not leaving me and still, continuing his dream
 as, he has gone through baseball being there for me as i grew up. >> now you're
 to get me emotional talking about my son. Okay. >> what does that mean to you,
 to hear him recognize how important, that is to him 18 he says some things on
 camera and in interviews surprise me sometimes. Because he doesn't really say
 it to me. But, he's a special kid. He's a special kid. >> what was that in you
 that made you want to be committed 18 >> i just remember my dad saying to me,
 you know what 18 okay, it's happened. You just got to become a man faster than
 you wanted to. I will be there every day to help you through. When he said that
 me, that talk, that father-son talk i knew everything was going to be all
 right. And i was determined to make it all right. >> so at rutgers he played
 football, required by his scholarship and baseball, because he loved it. >> my
 first at-bat i hit a homerun. Then came up the next time. I hit another home
 run. I knew right then and there that was my calling. >> as a standout baseball
 showed interest. >> they held off because the fact i was going back for my
 senior year in football that i was more committed to football that i wanted to
 play football. All they had to do was ask me, take me away from this. >> he
 would graduate from rutgers in four years with his name in the football and
 baseball record books. A business management degree. And as the los angeles
 dodgers draft pick in the 43 rd round. Determined he was better than that he
 worked seven days a week at rookie ball in florida. >> sunday was off day but
 it wasn't an off day for me. Because, me and coaches would get out there and
 take thousands of ground balls. I just remember that. You know what 43 that's
 hot. Sweating. Tired. I didn't never think about that. I kept thinking i got to
 better. I got to get better. >> good enough to be called up to the majors july
 30 th, 1992 playing against the padres, and, tony begin. >> i remember him
 looking at me in his eyes, tony said, i never forget that, play hard, have fun
 you will have a long career. >> next stop the colorado rockies in the 1993
 expansion draft. >> that first home game, once i hit the home run, if i didn't
 believe it, the people made me believe it. >> first as an outfielder, into the
 playoffs in 1995 and then 1996 , back at second base. >> that was my best year.
 everything came together. Mentally and physically. >> a base stealing machine,
 a national league high of 53 and being the second modern day player to have a 6
 steal game, all worth thinking being named an all-star. >> when i was a little
 kid, introduce, tipping hat and wearing their nice shoes and everything. So i
 enjoyed that and turning double play which was his last all-star game. >> with
 a trade back to the dodgers in '98, he was the toughest batter to strike out in
 national league in '99. Knowing his goal, was just to get on base. >> use these
 that was my job. >> he act selled at that with the chicago cubs. The milwaukee
 brewers, by 2003 with the san francisco giants. Reunited with his off-season
 workout friend, barry bonds. >> he's an inspiration to all the other guys. I
 try to tell him before we're working out, said you know, you stand next to me.
 we're in lineup people will think i'm the better athlete that's not necessarily
 and you can give a lot to a lot of people. Show size doesn't matter. >> with
 age comes at justments. Signing with texas in 2004 as utility player. >> called
 utility. >> super utility 2004 >> a good fit for san diego in 2005 especially
 when an injury and illness suddenly meant he was starting centerfielder opening
 >> it was funny. I remember, 3 -2 , jason bay. Boom. That's all i thought
 about, going to get it. I got it. I paid for it. >> we hope that shoulder is
 okay. >> rather than surgery and being out for a year, too long at this stage
 in his career, he took his chances with intense rehab. Returning sooner than
 expected. >> reactivated to, play tonight. Eric young. >> young was a big part
 of the second half. And the padres, division title. >> enjoy the moment. There
 is lot of teams wish they was in our place right now. >> ey, with a swing, -2

 and contributing to the game. He's a man with another family plan. That's next
 on" one-on-one". Later mike cameron's amazing comeback from a dramatic
 collision. >> a big league uniform is a long way from new brunswick new jersey.
 his heart and "paycheck", eric young hasn't forgotten who helped him get here.
 >> the thing, that is the coolest in me, was, buying my mom and dad the nice
 house on the lake. >> a proud father with his son a single a all-star with the
 rockies, ey's playing timeline is based on this goal. >> i think it has many
 years as it takes my son to take to the major leagues. That's how many years i
 have left, yes. >> one way to stay in shape for now. A routine far from the
 bright lights and base paths of the diamond. It's off-season and occasional in
 season yoga classes clear his head, keep his muscles limber even at 100 plus
 degrees the calming tones will also come in handy as he's about to reenter
 another zone, fatherhood again. >> yes she is. >> bianca jackson's friend
 invited eric to her super bowl party, when her friend couldn't go, bianca
 almost backed out until she called eric. >> there will be great food, great
 people, why don't you come on over. I was glad i went. It was definitely, a
 great decision. >> now married they're based in houston. She visits san diego

 courtship. >> that's what bought our friendship. We had a bond with that. >>
 they hope to open a day-care some day. Ey on the air as player in different
 cities might pursue tv after baseball. But he isn't done with baseball yet. >>
 makes the catch at the wall 100 0 >> if he and his son could write the end of
 ey's major league story it would start with two of them being on same team. >>
 i would like for them to call him up for me, but give us one day in the big
 leagues together. Then they can release me and give him the spot. >> probably
 bat lead off. He will bat second. First and second we pull off a double steal.
 >> that would be awesome. >> that would be awesome. >> baseball isn't usually
 considered a contact sport but in those rare and often dramatic it moments when
 and speed, meet a wall, or another person, the results are often devastating.
 mike cameron knows that all too well. >> throw is too late. Right center. Mike
 cameron. >> at six two, 200 pounds and. 33 years old, mike cameron is
 comfortable and confident covering his favorite position, centerfield. What you
 of all-star and two-time gold glover. >> makes the catch. >> he is
 unbelievable. >> but for mike cameron, running, leaping, catching, and just
 being able to see are all nothing short of amazing. Must feel so grateful. >> i
 felt grateful even more so now than, you know, things that went through, to,
 play the game. You know, just to play. Lot of guys, have surgeries and
 injuries, they're not allowed, just don't allow them to come back. >> coming
 back seemed unlikely in not unimagineable after one fateful day, summer of 2005
 playing against the san diego padres in petco park. >> it will score beltran.
 >> cameron was the right fielder for the new york mets. Not his natural
 position. He had been moved to right because the mets had brought in carlos
 beltran to play center. Cameron had steadily been making the adjustment by
 august 11 th. Then in the bottom of the 7 th 7 7 >> ball over in right center.
 thought i had the ball. Next thing you know, i got, hit by a freight train. >>
 oh. What a terrible collision. >> oh, boy. >> i don't know where i'm at. My
 mind was, puzzled. I'm dazed. I have no idea but i do know that, only thing i
 know i'm alive. D but, i can't move. My body won't move. >> this is bad as
 collision i've seen. >> i didn't know the extent of the damage or anything else
 that. I just knew that, why didn't i catch the ball. They kept me pinned down
 on my back longest. Trying to move my legs knowing i can get on my side to
 breathe. Because i can't. I'm choking. Blood. And, finally, i think, once
 trainer rey ramirez came out there, turned me on my side. They found out my
 neck was broken or whatever. Everything is in place. I want to get up. I want
 to get up and look around and my body, i want to see myself. Make sure
 everything is okay. But they don't let me get up. Both of my lips split. My jaw
 unhinged a little bit. My face is burning. Extensively. I had a headache, out
 of this world. But i was calm though. I don't know why. I don't know why until
 i got in ambulance they started cutting my clothe off. They only do that when
 there is something serious. I was real seriously in distress inside because i
 knew that, you know, when they took me off the field that may be my last time
 going back on a baseball field. >> how he would eventually deal with his
 injuries is rooted in his history. A guy able to adapt and bounce back, even as
 quiet, yet adventerous kid. >> jumping off back of the house. Jumping,
 bicycles. Trying everything. >> born michael terrance cameron, january 8 th,
 1973 his hometown is, la grange, georgia where he first played baseball in his
 neighborhood at six. >> i was kind of like a little guy in the middle of the
 whole thing but i could run. I could do everything. >> even though his parents
 were in his life he and his brothers and sisters spent a lot of time at grandma
 mae's house after his grandfather died, she adopted young mike. What did you
 learn from her 1973 >> hard work. I mean, just dedication. And she was like a,
 you know, most sound person in our family. >> toughened up from playing
 football he preferred baseball which might have been his ticket to college. But
 couldn't pass up the chicago white sox who drafted him out of high school in
 the 18 th round. >> i didn't know if i was pretty did i to do it but that's
 what i wanted to do. >> just four years later made his major league debut,
 exciting for him and his family. >> i was living some parts of their dream. I
 finally made it to be the, player that they thought i could be but i didn't
 really know yet. >> as a top prospect he started next season in aaa. But once
 called up again, he stepped up. >> whoa boy. Mike cameron. >> finishing 6 th in
 american league rookie of the year balloting. After struggling his sophomore
 year the white sox traded him in nipt nine to the cincinnati reds for paul
 konerko. Of after establishing career-highs in every offensive category, he was
 to seattle in 2000 that was pretty high-profile deal with ken griffey, jr.,
 part of that mix. >> going for the guy probably best player in the league for
 longest. >> the team's advice 2000 >> be yourself. Do what you are capable of
 doing. >> as part of the sensational mariner season mike cameron proved
 himself. >> he does it again. >> earning first of two gold blofs. Picked as an
 all-star in, 2002 against his former white socks hit four consecutive home
 runs. First time that had been done in the american league since 1959 >> feel
 like i had something to prove to them all the time. I didn't know the reason
 why i was traded from there. >> as free agent and seattle not an option cameron
 with the new york mets. >> i thought i was ready for it. >> you weren't 1959 >>
 you don't quite, prepare for, everything that is going to happen there. >> with
 first serious injury, a torn tendon in his hand, and with several players
 already on the disabled list 1959 1959 >> i couldn't allow myself to go on the
 dl i struggled with the game of baseball. I was getting place erred. I was
 getting booed at home. It was everything. I never got booed at home before.
 and, it was a good experience for me. It was character building situation for
 myself as a man. >> even under the microscope, he broke the met's home run
 record for centerfielders. Became the 11 th player in mets history to hit 30

 what's possible now, that type of injury, why did you want to come back 0 >>
 that's a good question. I think i needed to come back just for the sake i
 always came back through everything. And, i don't think there was a particular
 reason why i couldn't. Smooth like the ocean on a peaceful night. Yes yet so
 powerful and thunderous as wave crashing into land not only for but my little
 one toss show a little bit, they saw me go through everything too. They saw all
 those different days that i had to go through and, couldn't he see. Couldn't
 eat. Losing a lot of weight. To get, my strength back, to get back on what i
 always do. I just, i think it was a good, good opportunity for me to show them
 that, you go through certain things in life, there's a lot of different
 obstacles in life that we go through. As human beings. If you're able to live
 through it, then it's only going to make you stronger. >> my swing, my swing,

 matt: formerly the ballpark in arlington now going by america quest field. A
 little earl, "prime time padres" as your padres get ready for the texas rangers
 welcome back, matt vasgersian along with mark grant, and fans ready to put this
 thing behind them. Mark: the mavs lost to the heat last night. They had their
 chance. I don't feel sorry for them. Matt: people riding off the mavericks
 after the season now, and some may have written off vinny castilla, but look at
 now. Mark: 14 games in june, the slugging percentage, 0.591 is the one that
 sticks out. This ball over the heart of the plate and southwest airlines,
 vinny, you are now free to move about second base, thank you very much. Did you
 that swing 0.591 mostly upper body, staying back on it, going to right center
 field. Two times, vinny to left center and right center field. This is one guy
 that the padres need to keep hot in they want to stay in the race with. Matt:
 got a deal going on with southwest airlines, now, too 0.591 mark: nonstop to
 chicago. Matt: ben johnson returns to the big league level and he made an
 impact last night. He has a conversation with mud next. We'll see how many not
 so modest plugs my partner with throw in there. Mark: welcome back to hot,
 windy, sticky texas and we're going to be joined with the memphis flash, ben
 johnson and he paid dividends yesterday, back to the big leagues. Great to be
 back, i would suppose, ben, and the first question is the differences. You've
 been back and forth a couple of times. Psychologically how do you deal with
 that 0.591 >>ben: you have to step into a different routine when you get called
 the major leagues. Different bus times, hitting times, it definitely 0.591
 0.591 there is a transition period. I know it helps, though, knowing what to
 expect firsthand. It helps me with the transition, make it a little easier, i
 guess, yeah. Mark: the minor leagues in portland you're playing every day. You
 can come to the ballpark and come geared to play every day. In the big leagues
 how does that work mentally, when you know you're not going to 0.591 >>ben: i
 try to get swings in and working out in the outfield. Today i got to the
 ballpark earlier, and boch told me i wouldn't be playing, so came here, got a
 good work out in, lifted weights for 35 , forty minutes, and you can make every
 productive. Mark: talk to me about the team in portland, how is everybody doing
 35 >>ben: everybody is doing well. Bats are started coming afrnltd and we were
 scuffling a little bit there for a while but there's a good ball team there,
 too. Mark: talk about the difference in the bats between triple-a and the big
 leagues. You've got guys coming up and veterans coming down. Talk about the
 scouting report. Is it as advanced as it is here 35 >>ben: no, way, a loot of
 times you don't know who is pitching that day until he steps on the mound.
 totally different. No video work. You can't go to the ballpark earl and expect
 to see pitches from a guy. You have to take your notes and word of mouth is the
 way to get a scouting report on the guy. Mark: talk about boch because he likes
 fill everybody in in their role and what you were called up, what des to say 35
 when he puts me in there he wants me to give it all i got. He's told me that
 from time to time, i want to see how fast you can go. He hasn't said a whole
 lot since eye been here yet. Mark: talk about growing up in memphis examine
 playing here in texas it's something you're used to. I know you like playing in
 diego, because that's probably the best weather in the united states, but
 growing up in the memphis area and here in texas. >>ben: you can have the
 humidity, mark, and there's no better weather than san diego. It doesn't take
 much to get loose, here, i guess, sprints, you got sweat going, but i'd rather
 take the dry heat over the hu heat. Mark: ben, when do you feel like 35 35 do
 you have the sense now that you're like, man, there is a learning curve but
 when do you get that feeling that you're doing what you need to do. >>ben:
 breaking camp with the team i thought there was a chance that i would be here
 for the long haul, but things happen, guys get hurt and that affects me in the
 chain, you know what i mean, but i feel like i can play here, i want to get out
 and get some at-bats. Do i belong 35 i'd say so. I think i'm a major league
 player. I try to go out there examine prove that from time to time. Mark:
 you're going to be on the bench tonight but that doesn't mean you won't get an
 at-bat, a guy like kefb millwood, what would what would you do to prepare for
 the game 35 >>ben: i would see how he is working all the other right-handed
 hitters, mike cameron, mike piazza, how he's going after those guys and make my
 from there. Mark: talk about merv, the hitting coach, merv rettenmund, have you
 a chance to sit down with merv and go over your tendencies 35 >>ben: merv and i
 spoken the last couple of days, and basically he's trying to get me to slow
 everything down. That's what everybody is trying to do that's worked with me.
 him and i 35 35 i'm listening, and things are work out. Mark: you and i crossed
 yesterday and you had a cup of coffee in my hand. What did i say to you 35
 >>ben: what did you say 35 mark: i said that cup of coffee is always better in
 the major leagues than it is in the minor leagues. >>ben: yeah, you did, and
 hopefully it will be. Mark: more coming up. Game 2 from arlington, coming up
 after this. 2 g 2 k matt: in san diego matched up with one of the american
 league's top offenses last night it was a 6 -5 win over the rangers for the
 padres. Tonight one of the brightest stars makes his return to the loan star
 state as ex-ranger chris young looks to win a 7 th high of the year tonight.
 it's part 2 of the padres texas 2 2 step so grab a partner and swing around.
 game 2 of the padres and rangers, next. Ameriquest field, where your padres
 contend with the rangers. Couple of division leaders at it again tonightment
 welcome back to arlington, matt vasgersian along with mark grant, the padres
 win in a series opener, it did not come without noise from the rangers' bats,
 they have swung them big all year long. Mark: the rangers lead all of major
 league baseball with 174 doubles, 10 triples, and the home runs are down, but
 the doubles are up. 1 through 9 they can hurt you. They're aggressive with that
 and they're going to get extra hits at this ballpark. Matt: tonight it's about
 a great pitching match-up. Chris young for san diego as good as he's been
 overall he's been better on the road this year. >>> you'd loov to have a guy
 like chris young on the road to take the bull by the horns and win you ball
 games. These are great numbers, but let's fa it, chris young was in a texas
 uniform. They know what he offers out there. This could be a great match-up.
 chris young knows their weaknesses, and the hitters know what he has to offer.
 i'm looking forward to this one. Matt: this is an assignment that chris has
 been looking forward to for some time as we have as well. The other half of the
 one of the aces on the texas staff, right hander kevin mill road who has had
 his share of trouble at home. A padre starter good on the road, a ranger who
 struggled in arlington, should be good. Opening pitch, padres and rangers,
 coming up next. Matt: welcome back. Time for baseball, the padres and the
 rangers in game 2 of this 3 3 game series, tomorrow's afternoon affair
 nontelevised before the friars return home to start a home stand with the
 mariners on friday. Let's look at the line up tonight. Eric young gets the call
 lead off. Cameron, giles follow in the first, piazza, gonzalez and bellhorn
 four through 6 , first start for bellhorn in a couple of days on this road
 trip, greene, castilla and barfield round things out for san diego. Good
 numbers by a handful of friars on the trip. And right hander millwood will have
 hands full. Millwood 8 -3 overall and he is among leaders in a categories, a
 couple, that he's proud of and he's also a leader in categories, which he would
 to stay away from, things like hits allowed, and he's been hit hard at home
 this year. >>> on the road he is pitching lights out but here in arlington the
 numbers don't seem to be in his favor. He is a guy that late in the ball game
 you look up and he's going to go 8 solid innings on you. There are chances you
 can get to the right hander millwood. He's developed into a pitcher as he's
 gotten older. Earl in the days he threw hard, but along with that fastball he's
 a 2 2 seamer, he'll cut the fastball and he has a curve ball and a change-up.
 matt: kevin millwood ready for his 16 th assignment of the year, pricey free
 agent to the rangers over the course of the winter. And boch got his 900 th win
 night. Young, cameron and giles set to go. Millwood gets a sign from catcher
 gerald laird, and here is our first pitch of the night. Fastball taken for a
 strike. We mentioned the match-up numbers that finder rick young in the line up
 10 for 28 career against millwood. Tough decision with boch starting with who
 would hit lead off and play left field tonight, because ben johnson certainly
 did nothing to deserve a night on the bench tonight. He had a fine evening as
 you discussed with bengi in our pregame interview, but to keep the guys going,
 eric young gets the call tonight. Mark: that's what young is looking forward
 to, getting a start tonight. And bruce bochy likes it, too w because of the
 weather give the regs time off to take a break. He has many options. Since dave
 is d.l., bellhorn, and seeing the guy at the plate, eric young along with mike
 cameron. Matt: the former ranger, 1 -2 after the dodgers, lost to seattle
 yesterday, the padres with a game lead over l.a., a game and a half better an
 joaquin arias and colorado. They've picked up a half game on the giants in the
 last couple of hours as san francisco lost at home in an afternoon start to the
 mark: mike thompson did a fine job last night. He gave up 9 hits, 4 runs, but
 the padres did a nice job of outscoring the rangers. In the scouting report, we
 tell padres fans he's a strike thrower. He only walked 1 ranger last night.
 matt: young with a little infield pop. And michael retires eric for out no. 1
 tonight. Rangers defense brought to you by kragen. They have good once at the
 corners, mark teixeira shined brielths yesterday and hank blalock the san diego
 the rancho bernardo high, guy, last year recorded the best fielding percentage
 amongst american league third base men. Mark: this is a pretty well rounded
 texas team and we understand that buck showalter calls mark teixeira the con
 teixeira the condor because of a couple of nice plays mark teixeira made over
 there at first base last night. Matt: mike cameron has not faired well against
 millwood over the years. In fact, he is one of the veterans who may have
 cringed when they saw this pitching match up earlier in the week. Castilla,
 piazza, mike cameron, all guys millwood has handled quite well for the past
 number of years. 1 -1 the count to mike with 1 away and the bases empty. We're
 just underway in arlington tonight. Mark: free and easy is kevin millwood. Nice
 over the rubber, gets into a power position, he's a big boy, will come right
 after ya. He had a start against the twins where he got knocked around. They
 said it was a 90 90 degree in day, may 9 th, according to the folks i talked to
 and they hit him off the first cycle. They think the heat may have done
 something about that outing. Matt: and mike cameron hit by a pitch, so mike
 aboard the hard way with 1 gone to start t night. That's the second padre to
 have been hit in the series. Mark: looks like a 2 2 seamer, you can tell by the
 of the baseball. It gets in on him a little bit. Gerald laird was down the
 middle of the plate. I think he wanted to pound the inner third and it got away
 him. Like any pitcher you want to get that 1 , 2 , 3 inning under your belt.
 now he will have to work out of the stretch. Matt: see if mike cameron looks to
 giles now, it was giles that was hit by a pitch yesterday, along the course of
 a 1 -4 series opener for brian yesterday. He's had a great road trip through
 the a.l. West, 8 for 17 , and now with 5 starts on the trip. See if cam roon
 looks for a chance to run, here. Mike is one of those guys we've noted in the
 past that has that philosophy, if you hit me it's going to cost you two bases.
 mark: that's a double. Matt: the problem is tonight gerald laird behind the
 plate has thrown out 9 of 15 base steelers, this year mark: that's 60 60 and
 the major league average is about 32 32 0 matt: mike cameron stays put, that
 bounces away from laird and cameron is going to get that base any way. So a
 runner in scoring position now. Mark: great reaction by cameron. As soon as
 that ball was in the dirt, it was a breaking ball and as soon as he sees
 daylight there he is off and running. Matt: runner at second, still no decision
 the official scorer as to how they get cameron over there, wild pitch or pass
 ball and giles catches into the gap in right center, and it's on, san diego is
 on the scoreboard, 1 out into the night against kevin millwood. A costly, wild
 pitch as we learned in the eyes of the official scorer, contributes into a run
 scoring start to the 9 th for san diego. Mark: it looked early on like kevin
 millwood was going to go after giles away. Soft stuff away, sinkers, away. He
 wanted to get that one in here. If you want to come in against a guy like
 giles, you better darn well get it in there and tie him up. That leak over the
 heart of the plate and the he smoked it. That's a good sign, mike cameron
 scoring a run, and high five's all the way around. Maybe it will be 901 tonight
 bruce bochy. Matt: mike piazza now up to the plate, trying to pick up giles and
 him in. The lead changed hands 3 times last night and this is as close as you
 get, the kind of game where you can't count anything done until everybody is
 showering. 1 -1 to piazza. The rangers, by the way, after the series opener
 start play tonight technically tied for a share of the western league division
 of the american league as oakland was shut out for the second consecutive game
 in denver yesterday. , and piazza bounces that to young. That's out no. 2 have
 you looked at it on paper, mud cat, just in terms of records, texas 38 and 33 ,
 diego, 37 and 33 , but these couldn't be more different teams 33 mark:
 absolutely. Pitch and go defense for the padres, you look at the staff they're
 second in the national league, buck showalter's troops, 8 th, giving up nearly
 five runs a game. Texas is 5 th in defense in the american league, also. Matt:
 here is adrian gonzalez now. Talk about padres having great road trips. Swing
 and a miss. Adrian went deep again last night, 10 on the year, leading off the
 sek. And there was little question that this was going to get out. Mark: that
 was a pretty swing. Matt: either you're pleased with the results, and gonzalez
 has been swinging the bat so well in the month of june, but it's the small
 things that lead to the good results that have been pleasing to bruce bochy.
 mark: one of the things that be adrian gonzalez turning on the fastball. You
 know, we know that adrian gonzalez, his strength is going down the left field
 line and splitting the gap in left center, and that was a great sign last
 night. He got a fastball, middle, middle in and he turned on it. Usually earl
 in the season when de pull a pitched ball 10 matt: breaking ball. Mark: when it
 a breaking ball. Matt: even on breaking balls, he wasn't 10 10 he is more often
 not looking to carve that pitch into the opposite field, which is fine, but
 when you have the opportunity to turn on a ball 10 10 everybody was happy to
 see that last night. There is a swing and a miss to end the top of the first.
 san diego is on the board, giles nokz in a run. 1 0 san diego. Matt: 1 1
 nothing san diego as we go to the home half of inning no. 1 and look at the
 rangers starting line up. Ricoh brings this to you. Gary matthews, young, mark
 teixeira, hank blalock, mark derosa, mench, brad wilkerson, kinsler and gerald
 laird round things out. A nielt that chris young has looked forward to ever
 since he learn of the trade that sent him from the rangers to the padres.
 nobody has been better in terms of starters in the month of june. Chris is
 coming off a no-decision in a losing effort to the dodgers, most recently but
 that hardly blocks what he has been able to do over the last few starts. Mark:
 matty, we've talked about the numbers on the road for chris young. Outstanding.
 has to stay within himself. He's playing against his former team, guys get a
 little fired up too much, and they start to overthrow too much, and hopefully
 he can find an early groove and get locked in, that tunnel vision to where he
 is hitting his spots and look up to where he's deep in the ball game. Matt:
 gary matthews, 3 -1 , now. Chris allowed a couple of earned youngs in that last
 2 earned runs in 5 innings of work and that was more damage than anybody had
 done against chris young in about a month. Gary matthews takes a strike and
 it's 3 -2 , full count now. Here is the pay off home. Chris spends a lot of
 time -2 -2 he spent a lot of time today looking at video of rangers that he's
 not necessarily familiar with, some of the newer additions to the line up, like
 kinsler, here. Strikes out gary matthews, 1 gone. The defense likes playing
 behind chris as you works fast on the mound and this is a look at the defense
 active unit tonight brought to you by ocean's 11 casino. A similar look as to
 last night's opener, with the exceptions being piazza catching today, and e.y.
 in left field. Barfield gets a rest. Mark: he gets to spend some time at home
 with his mom and dad in houston, enjoying a big league ball game, watching
 their son play second base. One gone for young, who had a couple of knocks
 yesterday, and young quickly in the hole, 0 -2 starts with all-star numbers,
 0.328 batting average numbers. Mark: matty, you and i were at the ballpark
 today and i asked, what do you think of michael young, just one of those
 questions that you want to hear a guy elaborate on, and he said he likes this
 guy, he had him on tour in japan, the whole package. Matt: he likes the
 personality and the guy inside the uniform, as well as the numbers. 2 -2 the
 count. Mark: this might be a case of -2 -2 i'm not going to put words in chris
 young's mouth, but first-inning jitters, maybe not trusting his stuff, going
 after guys hoor here early on. Matt: it was a pitch count that got in chris
 young's way against the dodgers, last week at home and he was only able to go
 five innings in that one. It's a game that the dodgers, salvaged in the series
 to get out of there with one win. A slider that missed, 3 -2 mark: i think
 that's been a great pitch for chris young the last 5 , 6 , maybe 7 starts. Both
 righties and lefties. Matt: full to the second straight batter to start the
 ball game. That's been the difference for chris in terms of his evolution from
 a fly ball pitcher to a guy that can punch people out, record outs on the
 ground, and this is not the guy that the rangers watched pitch for an entire
 year here in 2005 mark: i think one of the reasons why chris young has grown
 into the pitcher that we've seen as a padre, he's trusting more of his 4 4
 seamer. Remember, here in texas the ball has a ndency to fly. A lot of pitching
 might say, oh, you got to go to a two-seamer, we've god to work grounders,
 grounders, grounder is, and you forget about the fact that he can throw the
 ball 90 , 92 mile-per-hour. Matt: singled in to left field. Curious to look at
 that again. I don't know if that was a slider that he missed with. It was a
 fastball. Mark: yep. It's good location, that's one of those situations where
 michael young has to protect, right 92 he goes down to get it. He's so far back
 holds his hands, there, to keep them back. He found a hole on the left side
 there for a base knock. Matt: so a 1 1 out batter as the bottom of the second
 starts out in similar fashion as to san diego's run-scoring top of the first.
 and now mark teixeira 2 for-5 yesterday, numbers that are down substantially
 from last year. The switch-hitter teixeira, and then the left-handed hank
 blalock up next. He doesn't get cheated up there, does he 2 a big swing ask a
 miss. Mark: did you see that upper cut, that aggressive swing. One ball, no
 strikes, what kind of a swing are you going to take 2 oh yeah 2 i love that.
 how many people did you talk to today, matty, that thought that ball was fair
 off the bat of teixeira last night 2 matt: funny the way that broke down, a lot
 people at the ballpark thought that ball was fair and others, those that work
 here that have been involved in baseball for a longer time, less knee-jerky,
 they agreed with us, they didn't think it was anything but foul from the moment
 left the bat. Mark: trevor said he was surprised the ball didn't hook more than
 did. From his vantage point he couldn't see how it would have been fair. He
 thought it was foul. Matt: young runs and teixeira bounces it to second base,
 they stay out of the double play by starting a runner, and they get teixeira on
 ground ball. Mark: that ball was hit hard. If he hits that baum 10 feet either
 side of josh barfield, there is a chance that ball squeaks through. He hit it
 hard, but you know what, chris young hit the spot and muser aligning the
 defense there in the infield. There's tony muser. Matt: so now hank blalock, 49
 batted in lead the rangers, 2 for-5 with an rbi yesterday, he's trying to pick
 up young at second base with 2 gone, and he takes a strike. Mark: first pitch
 breaking ball. Piazza went out and had a chat with young before blalock got
 into the box, and he said, hey, let's put something on this guy. Matt: that's
 part of the luxury of the 3 3 catcher equation, is that, you know, by the time
 you get through the 5 starters, the guys in the bullpen, there is going to be a
 that everybody likes. Big swing and a miss. Boy, they are up there hacking.
 mark: grip it and rip it. You saw mark teixeira, hank blalock from the left
 side, also. Big guy, big swing. Once in a while they're going to run into one.
 matt: so nothing and 2 on hank blalock, mark derosa next. The 0 -2 pitch is
 popped foul, that will be out of play. When we got to the ballpark today and
 looked over the starting lineup for san diego, you notice piazza catching
 because we were all under the assumption that he was going to d.h. The entire
 road trip. Bruce bochy told us there are a couple of things working here, bard
 still tender, and he hopes to have bard tomorrow, but he wanted mike catching
 at least one day on the trip so as not to get completely rusty behind the
 plate. So a good opportunity, today, with bard a little banged up, and boch
 wanting mike to get some work behind the plate to have mike catch chris young,
 and chris likes working to mike, to make it even a better fit tonight. No swing
 blalock on the appeal, 2 -2 mark: first base is open sxufshgs a right hander on
 mark derosa, you might see another breaking ball here, maybe back door or down
 and in to blalock. Matt: -2 chuckles -2 up around the lips. I'm telling you
 these guys do not get cheated and you know what's amazing, when you look at the
 numbers the rangers put up, you would think they punch out like freaks, you
 would think they would lead the league in punch-outs, not the case. They're
 among trailers, in strikeouts in the american league. Aggressive, yet
 disciplined. Mark: yeah. Matt: if there can be such an animal. On 2 -2 again.
 and a dive and a smater by barfield, here going to wave young around. Mark: tag
 tag him, tag him, mike, go tag the runner. Matt: home plate umpire filled mike
 in as he applies the tag. Mark: yes, sir. Matt: i would love to be a fly on the
 in the conversation between wilkie and piazza. Take a look at it again. Never
 touched the plate. How did that go again -2 matt: somebody get mark cuban on
 the phone, more controversy from a sports team from dallas. We'll look at it
 again. Mark: young thinks he tags the back point of home plate, and quite
 honestly, i think the padres catch a break, you see it, his hand covers it.
 matt: no, no, he missed the plate. You're being a reverse homer. Look, watch.
 he misses it, mark. Mark: no, i think he got it. Matt: this is where it gets
 interesting. Piazza, he assumes that young tagged the plate. Meanwhile bellhorn
 things off and then it got fun. When mike wanted to put the tag o watch the
 move. This is, again, the missed tag, young thinks he touch the plate. Watch
 the move. This is from mike's street roots playing pickup basketball. -2
 chuckles -2 what was that shoulder move he put on him -2 mark: that was funny.
 matt: 2 balls and a strike, the count to bellhorn leading things off in the
 second. Mark: you know, when a team is going good, you get those calls, right 2
 yeah. Mark: once again, i think the umpire was blocked. He couldn't see where
 his hand was touching home plate. Matt: un, after michael young slid, he almost
 himself up by turning back to look at the umpire. I think. Bellhorn lines into
 right. And he stops around first, wisely so, as mark derosa got on it quickly.
 a lead-off base hit in the second. Matt: watch young after the play, i'm safe,
 right 2 right 2 little cup check there, and mark: and he knows he's going to be
 but he's going to talk to the umpire, like, "dude, what's up with that 2 "
 matt: i love that move. Here is khalil greene with bellhorn aboard. Greenie
 yesterday 1 -4 and a fastball starts him with a strike. Mark: that's a way to
 hang him, matty. Matt: a pair of controversial calls yesterday in the 9 th.
 woun a ground ball out off the bat of gary matthews, and then, of course, the
 home run or foul ball call that was contested by the rangers. I think the
 cowboys open in jackson ville this year as greene grounds to third, hank
 blalock to ian kinsler, back to teixeira, no controversy on that one, score it
 5 to 4 to 3 and there are 2 gone in the second. Mark: pitchers know when
 they're on the mound and you have guys struggling, you try to throw quality
 pitches and take the sting out of the bat. He tried to force that and pull that
 khalil did, and he hit it for the double play. Matt: so 2 gone now for the red
 hot vinny castilla, 3 for 4 yesterday. Where was i going with that, yesterday,
 you asked 4 the cowboys, opening in jackson jackson jackson jacksonville 4
 let's see if it. O. Is involved in a controversial call coin to say or
 something. So as we talked about, when we went on the air, vinny castilla who
 has gotten red hot here in june, we learned today in speaking with bruce bochy
 that vinny was hours away from becoming a bench player. When he started to get
 hot and really when people took notice in anaheim, boch had a conversation with
 and told him, i got to make a change, bell more than is going to be our third
 baseman, and vinny said, what if i get a couple of hits tod >> 1 1 nothing san
 diego as we go to the bottom half of inning no. 2 chris young goes back to
 work, he gets mark derosa, mench and brad wilkerson as he goes to work. Mark
 derosa ha three singles in yesterday's ranger loss to open the series. 1 ball
 and 1 strike. Such a great turnaround for mark derosa this year as a ranger. A
 good player during his time in atlanta, but never with the kind of numbers even
 to what he's in the midst of now. Digging in, hitting 0.343 as you saw a moment
 mark derosa's previous high a 0.297 average over 72 games, his first real taste
 big league pitching with the braves in 2002 big hack and a miss, 3 balls and 2
 strikes. Man 2 mark: you know what 2 that's the kind of hack you want, 3 -1 you
 a fastball, sure, it's outer third and it's up, trying to carve that ball the
 other way or whatever. Matt: struck him out. Mark: got him off ball and out of
 the box after swinging off ball. Matt: second of the game for chris young. The
 a's come to town starting the 27 th. Tuesday and wednesday's games are at 7 :05
 thursday's at 12 :35, check out padres.com. Mark: i here campy has been
 swinging a hot bat. Matt: yeah, and he billy north at the top of the a.'s
 order. Here is mench now, yesterday, 0 for 4 he has had much more success when
 starting in right field as opposed to starting at d.h. Men mench getting the
 call tonight, and 4 4 mark: this guy will hit 20 plus home runs, pretty much
 mark it down. If he stays healthy. Matt: young behind him 3 0 chris has fallen
 behind now 5 of the first 6 hitters that he's faced tonight. And he loses his
 first of the ball game, there's mench, walk no. 1 chris walked 3 against the
 dodgers on thursday. 3 walks is his season high, he's done that on a handful of
 this year. So for the second straight inning the rangers have a 1 1 out base
 runner to work with. Now it's the left hander, brad wilkerson. Wilkerson was
 among those that chris young was trying to familiarize himself with before the
 game tonight as brad wilkerson is in his first year as a ranger. He and chris
 were never teammates, so the 13 home runs and with a stroke that's a by the
 unfamiliar to c.y., chris was paying attention to him on video before the game.
 the corner there, 2 0 mark: you mentioned last night that brad wilkerson
 strikes out a lot, so a pitcher takes that into consideration. He's fallen
 behind, 2 0 , wilkerson is showing patience, here, and he knows he will chase
 out of the strike zone, especially with 2 strikes. He is getting there quickly.
 out of stretch with mench aboard. A swing and a high fly ball into right field
 for giles. That's out no. 2 first time through the order, and the rangers are
 taking some big swings against chris young tonight. Mark: and, you know, here
 at arlington, the flies are going straight in with some authority. You would
 think by these hacks, because of the wind here at the ballpark, be wa w 2 2
 beware for the wind at the ballpark and hang onto your hat. Matt: there's a
 strike to start the at-bat with ian kinsler. Chris has thrown 42 42 pitches and
 not yet completed with 2 innings. That pitch count may stand in the way of a
 long start. Mark: he needs a 6 or 8 8 pitch inning. Matt: bullpen got a lot of
 work yesterday, and for san diego, after the day off monday, a we will-rested
 bullpen was utilized. 5 guys pitched after the starter yesterday. Mark: boch
 today in the office said everyone is good to go. After his 900 th win last
 night. Walked into his office, there was a baseball sitting on his desk. Trevor
 who usually keeps his save balls, he collects them, each and every save 900
 after that ball game, trevor hoffman marked it up with 900 th victory and
 presented it to manager bruce bochy. Matt: that's neat. Mark: very nice. Boch
 was very impressed. Matt: tell you, i mean, trevor is very much aware that he
 has boch to thank for a lot of his career success. Mench runs. It's lined into
 the seats foul. Trevor coming off injury and boch having all the confidence in
 the world in his closer. You know, what totals get to be at the point where
 trevor's are, there has to be a relationship with managers. You're not going to
 that many opportunities if managers aren't confident in you. Big swing ask a
 foul ball. Mark: you know what, trevor got the save last night, for his 17 th,
 and that's good news from the skipper that he's good to go again tonight. Gave
 up a hit last night and that was it. Matt: the angles, beat the giants earlier
 this and a couple of other games begin shortly, seattle at l.a., one of those.
 we'll continue to keep our eyes on those. By my unofficial count this is the 4
 th full count against chris young in 8 batters faced. Mench runs on 3 -2 and
 it's fouled back. Mark: he's going to throw 50 pitches in 2 innings. Matt: and
 shut out innings. Mark: i was going to say from an offensive standpoint from
 texas i haven't seen one guy try to carve the ball the opposite way. Even with
 the runner going right there, 2 outs. You know 2 matt: swing and a miss, strike
 , no carving tonight. 3 punch-outs by the ex-ranger. Matt: take a guided behind
 scenes tour of petco park, offered on sundays sunday tuesday through sundays,
 visit padres.com. Kevin millwood goes back to work, 1 1 nothing friars, and
 josh barfield has been sitting around watching these big hacks and says "i want
 un." mark: do you think it's psychological, some guys see that and get up there
 get froggy 1 do you think it carries over a little about 1 matt: why not 1
 sure. Josh behind, 0 -2 ball and 2 strikes to josh barfield. Kevin millwood
 knows what it's like to make guys swing and miss. He has struck out 66 on the
 year, only 17 walks and he annually has good strikeout to walk numbers. Misses
 high again, so 2 -2 now after being behind nothing and 2 to barfield. Last year
 millwood won only 9 games and i say "only" because he led the american league
 in e.r.a., 0.2 e.r.a. E. E.r.a. E.r.a., 2.86 0 he is an active big leaguer to
 have accomplished that areaest of hitting hit fe ting feats, no-hitters, back
 in philly. It's incredible, there have been no no-hitters, johnson's '04 being
 the most recent. Mark: really 0 matt: yeah. According to "chyron bob"
 wehrsdorfer. Young throwing to first to retire eric young by a step. It's the
 second time e.y. Has grounded out to his name sake and on that occasion it was
 very close. Mark: did you see how michael young, the shortstop, once he gets
 this baseball, and then he knows he has to gear up the arm, load up that hose,
 bang 0 got him by what, maybe a foot 0 that's a nice play. Matt: so now mike
 cameron with 2 gone and the bases empty. You know how whenever a guy throws a
 no-hitter on that rare occasion, it gives the stats people the numerologist,
 the trivia fanatic particularses particulars 2 2 fanatic particulars, they sink
 teeth into it. Matt: the last 3 pitchers, to no-hit the giants, all named
 kevin. Kevin brown, kevin millwood, and kevin johnson. Both of them against the
 terry mullholland did the first. That's that jason stark stuff that comes out
 that we, frankly love. Mark: it's good stuff. Does he label that as useless
 information 3 matt: that's right. Mark: it's good stuff. Matt: san diego
 scoring on an rbi by giles in the first. Mark: chris young has pitched well,
 because kevin millwood when he's out there starting for texas he is getting 5
 and a half runs of support, so first time through the line up, looks like chris
 has done extremely well. Matt: full count now, 3 -2 talking about the deal that
 millwood over from cleveland in the off-season, rangers were thrilled to be
 able to poach the reigning reigner reign leader in the field. Mark: beautiful
 approach. Talking about making adjustments, opposite side of the plate, not a
 lot of upper body movement, he just threw the hands that way. We've seen him a
 few thems this road trip going to right center field and to right center
 safely. Matt: so now brian giles with a runner aboard. See if cameron looks to
 steal a base here. Mike, after being hit by a pitch advanced on a wild pitch in
 first. Cameron has only been thrown out once all year and that was saturday in
 anaheim. Giles is responsible for the games only run this far with an rbi
 double and that hit like a shot a fair ball into the right field corner,
 cameron to third. That ball was absolutely smoked. Giles has a laugh about it.
 mark: just out of the reach of teixeira, and nearly hitting first base umpire
 tim mclellan. A 2 2 out knock for the friars. That's a dangerous area when you
 throw that breaking ball down and into the lefties, they're looking for it.
 matt: so now big opportunity for piazza, runners at the corners with 2 gone.
 mike bounced out to shortstop in his first try tonight. Kevin millwood very
 quietly has amassed a rather high pitch count. Bounced to hank blalock and
 millwood will escape this jam. Nothing comes of back-to-back two-out singles, 1
 nothing san diego. Matt: we go to the bottom half of inning no. 3 and take a
 look at our esurance comparison of the game tonight. Quote and compare
 instantly at esurance.com. Take a look at the numbers of adrian gonzalez and
 mark teixeira. It's a surprise that adrian is outslugging and outhomering a guy
 beat up on the big leagues last year. Mark: yeah, he split time being hurt in
 texas and 38 home runs. Teixeira proved he can put up serious numbers 38 38 oh
 my gosh, what happened there 38 matt: got in the wind and adrian didn't have a
 play on it. Happy birthday to gerald laird, you'll have another chance in an 0
 -1 count. Mark: adrian anticipated that ball being hit a little farther. He
 needs to go down a by the to get that ball up to adrian. Matt: popped it up
 again. See what the wind does to this ball. Barfield hangs with it to make the
 catch. Mark: tell you what, this is candlestick-like , huh -1 have to keep your
 moving. Matt: we talked about it yesterday. It seems to change directions not
 by the inning, not by the at-bat, but by the pitch. Here is gary matthews,
 junior, now, struck out in the first. You know, jason starks-type stuff, you
 talk about gary matthews and his father, senior, they talk about junior, son of
 senior. Jerry engineer jerry hairston is here, son of jerry senior and grandson
 jerry. Chet lemon -1 -1 as that ball is fouled away, the great tiger and white
 sox, his son marcus was the rangers's fourth-round pick this past june, a
 couple weeks ago. If you get into a time capsule for a few years and got out of
 and you saw lemon, mayberry, jerry hairston and gary matthews, you would think
 those guys were having incredible careers into their 50 s. 2 balls, 2 strikes
 to gary. Got 'em swinging. Mark: you think this team system a high,
 fastball-hitting team 2 you bet. Right at the letters, junior has to protect.
 matt: that's the first strikeout for chris that hasn't come in a full-blown
 hack. Mark: i was just going to say that. That's the first defensive swing i
 think tonight by the rangers. Matt: so now michael young with 2 gone. Mark:
 nice. Matt: 1 -1 chris is en route to what would be his lowest pitch count
 inning. That was pitch no. 12 here in the third. Mark: what else do you notice
 about why ung young second time around against these rangers 12 one thing i
 notice he's throwing more sliders, and dropping the hammer a little more, also.
 a look at the breakdown, 61 pitches, 62 slider on the half shell matt: that's
 the weapon now in chris' arsenol that he didn't have as a ranger, so you can
 understand if the rangers are confused by that. Mark: did you see the front
 side open up on young, there 62 matt: the 2 -2 up and in with a fastball, full
 count, now. Very fine line between trying to outthink your opponent and
 outthinking yourself, and chris seems to have walked that line well tonight.
 mark: he has to be short and quick, for the hitter. And he was on that fastball
 matt: almost got it up to the her met hermetically- sealed window, up here
 tonight. They only open it up for food, then they'll crank it out real fast. 2
 -2 to mark teixeira. To young, rather. Mark teixeira standing on deck next. No
 tv tomorrow afternoon. This road trip concludes with an 11 a.m. San diego start
 tomorrow examine then back home for the mariners on friday. This was going to
 be chris young's quickest pitch count inning. This will be the 9 th pitch of
 the at-bat on its way to michael young. In the air and slicing into the corner.
 of play. Mark: that ball wasn't far from staying fair and hitting that fair
 pole out there. Matt: you know, the angle we see down there, we see the corner
 it cuts and it says 349 and as you mentioned, there is a padding there and the
 wall shoots in a little bit. The way the balls travel right field in the
 series, it almost seems like it's 330 down there. Try it again. Lined to third
 and vinny gob bells it up for the first time tonight. Young gets the rangers in
 still 1 0 san diego. Matt: 1 1 nothing san diego as we go to the top half of
 inning no. 4 back with mark grant, matt vasgersian, padres scoring a run in the
 and that lead has held so far for chris young. Here is adrian gonzalez leading
 things off in the visitors' fourth. You know, we were talking today with our
 associate producer "chyron bob" wehrsdorfer, as we started running down active
 big leaguers, from san diego. We started to thinking about that's a good team
 you could put together. As gonzalez sprays to center field for matthews. And
 doing it off the top of your head as "chyron bob" wehrsdorfer did in about 3
 minutes, this isn't everybody but this is the kind of team you could put
 together if you want to take guys who have their roots in san diego and put
 them on the field together. First of all it's a heck of a staff, prior and
 harang, third base we put perez there but you could put hank blalock on there,
 too. Mark: sure. Matt: we hear a lot, especially when you come to texas, of
 texans in the big leagues. You know, yesterday jennings shut out the a.
 sxaeshgs they started off by saying, baylor grad and such and such high school,
 jennings shuts out the a.'s. Mark: how about darren balsley leading the
 pitching staff as coach. Matt: sure. Strike to bellhorn to make it 1 -2 how
 about the coach, john caterra -2 mark: nice. Matt: swing and a miss, strikeout
 for millwood. Third of the game for him. Let's take a look at our aflac trivia
 question tonight as we continue to take advantage of the fact that we've got
 some ranger history to discuss, a uniform we don't see often through the course
 the regular season. Tonight we ask "which ranger pitcher started a game 22 days
 being the club's first rounder in 1973 1973 " here is khalil greene. Speaking
 of first-rounders, a fly ball to right for mark derosa. It's the quickest of 1
 , 2 , 3 innings for kevin millwood. Matt: 1 1 nothing san diego, we go to the
 bottom half of the 4 th and answer the aflac trivia question. The pitcher that
 started the game here for the rangers 22 days off being a first-round choice in
 73 , david clyde, a texan, houston native, and then bob short ordered
 management to draft him but put him right in the big leagues, and he thought he
 a genius after clyde won a few games, packed a few houses, but the story did
 not have a happy ending, necessarily, he pitched here for three years and he
 was done. You talk about rushing a guy, that became a verb, to david clyde
 somebody was to rush somebody to the big leagues. Mark: i remember hearing
 stories of him throwing 140 , 150 pitches a game, they just left him out there.
 the consensus opinion by the baseball people was he wasn't ready, but owner
 wanted a promotional pop, and they blew the kid out. Mark teixeira leads things
 in the 4 th, teixeira, blalock and mark derosa for the rangers. Those earl days
 the rangers are chronicled in what is still one of my personal favorite
 baseball books ever written and i'm remiss for not recalling the name of the
 author, but he was a former beat writer that followed the rangers in their
 early days when they came here from washington and relocated as the senators to
 rangers, the name of the book is called "seasons in hell" and it documents the
 first two years of rangers history replete with stories of guys babyinging
 curfew and all that fun, off the field stuff that we've come to expect in
 sports stuff. Swing and a miss for teixeira, and that's strikeout no. 5 for
 chris young tonight. Mark: how was he going to miss that 5 that's a good
 fastball down the middle of the plate. You can get hurt there many times. Not
 that time. Matt: so now hank blalock, 2 for 5 yesterday, and he's singled
 tonight. Use used to imitate tony gwynn as a kid. Hank has said he was never a
 big guy growing up, and he's filled out as a major leaguer, but as a small guy
 that wasn't able to grip it and rip it, he learned how to carve and hit like
 tony gwynn. Into left center, cameron calling off young to make the catch.
 mark: there we got channel 4 fans, matty. Matt: that clearly got the check
 yesterday, that guy. Mark: the akimas that live in texas, family lives in
 oceanside. I got the letter right here, hi from beth marshall, you people out
 in oceanside. What do you think of that, matty 4 matt: think it's great. Here
 is mark derosa now with 2 gone. We've seen a lot of padre fans here in this
 series. Mark: did you get your letters sent your way 2 matt: no. It's okay.
 mark: i didn't think so. 2 chuckles 2 matt: 2 balls and no strikes the count to
 derosa. Matt: into right center, cameron has to move and it gets up and over
 his head, mark derosa rounding into second base. Having a heck of a series,
 here. Inch you know, we've talked about how the ball travels here in right
 center field. If you look at the route for mike cameron, i don't think he
 anticipated that ball going over his head. He thought he had a bead on that,
 and that ball was hit harder than mike thought. You can see mike smiling there
 and shaking his head. Matt: take a look at the swing by mark derosa, and watch
 how soft he is on the front foot. Kept all of his weight back there and those
 are among the adjustments that he has made with rudy jaramillo, the fine
 batting batting batting instructor here. The rangers are proud of what he's
 accomplished. Mark: the hard landing messes everything else on your body,
 matty. Matt: nothing-1 the count to mench. Apparently mark derosa used to dive
 a lot. And he would get caught out his front foot and that would make him
 vulnerable inside and pitchers would find it easy to bust him in, and the
 results are great, hitting 0.345 0 mench slices a fly ball into the right field
 1 -2 mench lines up the middle, and here comes mark derosa with the tying
 strike. -2 cheers and applause -2 matt: a 2 2 out ranger rally evens the score
 at 1 apiece. Mark: looks like mark derosa and mench and their approach the last
 up just shortened up a little bit. This ball is a high, hanging cutter or a
 slider, and you can see you can't take that big hack. He cut back, and both
 guys cut back on their approach. Matt: the inning started out innocently
 enough, hank blalock lined out, mark teixeira lined out, that was 7 in a row,
 then mark derosa's double, mench singles him home and we're back at 1 apiece. 0
 to brad wilkerson. A big swing ask a miss there. Nothing-2. Brad wilkerson will
 out. He leads big league baseball with 84 strikeouts on the year. And he ian
 kinsler ian kinsler the second baseman, next. That was the kind of pitch you
 throw what you want a new baseball, and you call time. Mark: i'm surprised they
 a pitch-outright there. Matt: mench runs, they smelled something but it doesn't
 as brad wilkerson swings and misses, it's strike 3 mark: that's why because
 he's vulnerable to the strikeout. Matt: rangers tie it. Not too close; whatta
 ya' think i got that insurance 3 what insurance is that yogi 3 aflac. 3 duck
 grunts 3 the one ya' really need to have... If you don't have it. That's why
 you need it. Need what 3 aflac. Well, if you get hurt and miss work it won't
 hurt to miss work. Huh 3 and they give ya' cash which is just as good as money.
 ask about it at work. 3 duck grunts 3 matt: your viejas mid game recap, a 1 -1
 draw through 4 , top of the 5 th, and vinny castilla, swinging through
 millwood. Mark: good old-fashioned pitchers' dual, in a ballpark where the ball
 and chris young pitching well on the road, and kevin millwood, who is
 struggling at home. Matt: not the case tonight. 1 gone for josh barfield.
 there's a knock back up the middle. Matt: kevin millwood with 8 -3 , and 3 -3
 with a 6.65 e.r.a. Here at home and for the guy that's in the first year of a 4
 year, nearly 4 50 million deal, i think that's a business disconcerting for the
 mark: absolutely. He was getting 5 and a half runs of support each start, and
 one of his pitches in his rep in line up, is a cutting slider, and he learned
 that from maddux. Matt: e.y.'s jam rolled out to young. Michael has really made
 night miserable back here at his old hounts. 6 -3 , nothing in the friar 5 th,
 middle of the night, still tied at 1 1 1 matt: 1 -1 tie through 4 and a half,
 ian kinsler leads off for the rangers, kinsler, laird and matthews for texas.
 rangers got a loan strike in the 4 th. Ian kinsler a strikeout victim in his
 first at-bat tonight. One of six posted by chris young. We have a freply wager
 out on the line tonight that we should probably bring fans into. The rangers as
 mentioned are 38 -33 , padres 37 -33 , statisticly, almost a dead heat. So as a
 of tonight, one of these two teams will claim a slightly better record and we
 got together with our friend and colleague, who is the radio voice of the san
 diego chargers, josh lewin and we were going to do one of those betts where
 it's a box of fish tacos in exchange for a brisket eater -33 -33 mark: go
 bolts. Matt: and we kachl up with if the padres beat the rangers, then josh is
 going to have to carry around hank bauers bags during the chargers season.
 mark: he does that anyway, doesn't he -33 matt: you're right. Whoever loses
 this game has to wear a big hank bauer button around for at least 24 hours,
 which for me would be a big honor. For josh it would be awkward, given the next
 he will be in san diego would be at a chargers practice. I think josh should
 have to wear a hammer button around all the time anyway. You know what 24 betts
 he should be glad to wear that button. Fly bought out to short right field,
 giles calling off garfield and that wind has been a real problem tonight,
 folks. Not to make any excuses 24 24 mark: that's a ball that's got to be
 caught. There was communication difficulties out there, in shallow right field.
 barfield, now he squares up, back pedaling, still, but he calls off, but
 judging by looking at these two players, i think that's giles ball, he has to
 take charge because josh barfield did peel off. Matt: so ian kinsler is aboard
 on a wind-blown double that was lost in the dusty texas night and now gerald
 laird has a chance to knock in that run. Kinsler at second, nobody down. Mark:
 now the big boy is going to have to reach back and do some big league pitching.
 ian kinsler tags up and gets to third. Wow 24 that ball was not hit very deep,
 mud cat. Mark: heads-up play by kinsler. As soon as that ball was hit he was
 immediately back to the bag to tag up and he's challenging the outfielders of
 the padres. Brian circles the ball, he comes up throwing. All they need snou a
 fly ball. Matt: they're going to change the scoring sdwigs on that ball that
 kinsler hit and hang an error on giles, so it's an e-9 that put the lead-off
 hitter at second, that man at third with one gone for matthews who struggled in
 series, 0 -6 , he's punched out twice tonight. Mark: infield about halfway in,
 matty, did you see that -6 hopefully a one-hopper at one of the infielders,
 trying to cut down that run. Not all the way in and not all the way back. The
 way the scoring is going tonight you want to get that run at the plate. Matt:
 into right field for giles, does he see it -6 he does. And that's more than
 enough to tag and score kinsler with the go-ahead run. Credit gary matthews
 with his 38 th rbi of the year. Texas takes their first lead of the night.
 mark: matty, did it seem like that ball was hang ng up there forever and ever
 38 matt: it was hard to read his body language out there, it appeared for a
 minute like he didn't see it. It. Mark: it looks to me like the corner is dark,
 it looks like there's not enough light out there. He may have lost it there for
 second. That's got to be the worst feeling. Matt: michael young now with a run
 in. Mark: matty from our vantage point up here in the booth, look at how it has
 lot of light there and you look at the corner outfielders, and it's dark. Matt:
 looks like a dark spot, especially in right. That will get out of 38 38 into
 the stands. 0 -2 to michael young. Mark: bad candles in the outfield. Matt:
 that's a good shot that illustrates that dark spochlt i'm not sure if it has
 something to do with the roof in right field or the pavillion. Mark: who knows
 -2 i think we should call hank bauer and ask what he thinks. Matt: what are the
 if the things were reversed that hank would wear a josh lewin button around -2
 mark: hank would do it anyway. Matt: he would say why do i need to wear a josh
 lewin button every night when i just pack him up and take him with me every
 night. Has the hammer donnie jail time -2 -2 chuckles -2 -2 seriously, unthe
 guy better than i do. He's a treat. Redefining political incorrectness with
 every word. A called strike 3 taken by young. Another strikeout for c.y. But a
 run for the rangers and for the first time tonight texas leads. 2 -1 matt:
 padres take on the mariners on friday night, and everybody gets a beach towel,
 tickets are available at padres.com or call 877 877 friars-tix. Mike cameron
 leads off inning no. 5 and for the first time tonight the padres trail texas.
 mike has scored the only san diego run thus far. Mark: this is the good part of
 line up for the padres if they can get to millwood. 2 hits for giles, 1 for
 cameron, mike scored a run, also, as matty mentioned. Millwood with the
 fastball, getting it up to 94 we know if he hits the sweet spot of the plate,
 padre hitters can do some damage. Matt: kevin millwood yet to walk a batter
 tonight. Mike cameron lines to left. That ball was hit hard but mench is in
 front to make the catch. Probably overuseded the term "strike thrower" and when
 speak of "we" i speak of us as an industry. He is always around the plate, only
 walks this year in almost 100 innings. His walks per 9 9 inning ratio is among
 the best in major league baseball, around fewer than 1 and a half per start.
 giles now with 1 gone. Mark: you love that as a manager, of course as a
 pitching coach, but also your defense. We talk about it so many times. You want
 guy to be around the plate and you want action in the infield and in the
 outfield. Make them earn their way on. Matt: giles grounds to shortstop,
 michael young has it and throws him out. 2 away. Well, in stark contrast to the
 fes the padres enjoyed last night, only 1 extra-base hit, and this coming on
 the heels of last night, where we saw them hit 6 extra base hits last night.
 and that has everything to do with kevin millwood. Mark: he's gotten grounders,
 he really needed it, couple double plays, 2 turned by texas tonight. Matt: 0 -1
 count to piazza. Mike is hitless tonight, 0 -2 swing and a high drive into the
 opposite field, mark derosa on the move, looking up and it's gone -2 -2 cheers
 and applause -2 solo shot for mike, his 9 th of the year and san diego gets it
 right back, tied at 2 apiece. That's why the big boy is in there. Mark: i love
 the follow-through of mike piazza when he goes to the opposite field. Watch the
 head down, oh, yeah 2 that's some kinda nice. 395 395 foot shot for the big boy
 matt: no. 406 in the hall of fame career of piazza, next up on the all-time
 list, do you come snyder and 40 th place, all-time. So now adrian gonzalez,
 with a 2 0 count. Mark: matty, only the 9 th home run given up by millwood this
 matt: he is still some kind a strong. 2 -1 the count to adrian, now. 3 -1 to
 gonzalez. Bellhorn next, 2 2 out bases empty, tied at 2 after the piazza shot.
 now it's 3 -2 to gonzal. Turning into a pretty good series for mike. 2 runs
 batted in yesterday, one in a home run tonight. He'll be in there tomorrow at
 the d.h. Spot. Gonzalez follows with a drive into the opposite field. Gary
 matthews read it well off the bat and runs it down. Rare long ball success
 against kevin millwood, mike piazza goes deep for the 9 th time this year.
 we're tied at 2 matt: 2 -2 tie as we go to the home half of inning no. 6 , san
 diego countering the rangers 5 th inning run with a piazza solo blast and we
 are tied once again, a 2 -2 draw as chris young goes to work on mark teixeira.
 mark: matty, the ideal situation here for chris young and the padres, after the
 th spich a quick inning here in the 6 th, keep it tied so he can be the pitcher
 record and hopefully the padres the next half of the inning can add on and have
 man, the big, 6 -10 right hander get them to victory. Matt: 2 -2 to mark
 teixeira, 0 -2 tonight. We talk about this often, getting in ask out of town
 while a team's premiere power guy is hurting a by the. Mark: oh, my. Matt: he
 discarded the bat thinking it was 0 -4 , he'll have a slice of humble pie.
 mark: what did i tell you about getting breaks, matty -4 look at this pitch. I
 think it's a ball. But you know what -4 chris young is getting another crack.
 matt: we talked about the drop-off between last year and this for mark
 teixeira. Batting average is a wash and in the same number of at-bats after 71
 games the real difference comes with power. 20 home runs at this point of the
 season last year, and only 6 as we stand today. Matt: 3 -2 dramatic upper cut
 on that swing as he pops it into short right for josh barfield. 1 gone. Keep
 'em quiet. Be sure to tune into a brand new edition of "san diego insider"
 tonight. Some say miramar is the answer for the airport, but the military says
 no. Will joint use work 1 some surprising answers on the issue on "san diego
 insider magazine." right after the game tonight. Hank blalock with 1 gone now.
 talked about it earlier, the fact that hank blalock grew up watching tony gwynn
 his swing. You could fill out a team of current big leaguers who initial
 watching of swings came from watching tony gwynn. Mark: hey, look at that 1
 chris young finishes up in a nice fielding position and makes the snag. Matt:
 look at that. He's an athlete, now. Up to 116 pitches, here, and with 2 gone
 he'll go to work on mark derosa, a guy whose given everybody trouble this
 series, 4 for 6 gotta figure, mud cat that with the pitch count getting to 1200
 chris young will not be back. Mark: yeah, and that's why i was saying. John
 adkins, low carb there in the padre bullpen. Matt: 0 -2 to mark derosa. Mark: i
 he might drop the hammer on him right here. No, high heat. Matt: ball and 2
 strikes. Mench next, in fact, the 5 and 6 spots have been productive for the
 rangers tonight. And the 1 -2 another high fastball fouled back. Young's
 numbers in this ballpark last year were slightly higher than his overall
 numbers. Whether that had anything to do with the fact that the rangers thought
 was expendable or not, we don't know. He had a 4.86 e.r.a. Here last year and
 of his 31 starts 20 of them came in this ballpark. The guy won 12 games and
 twha tied a rookie ranger's record. Mark: i heard that the padres were
 interested in gerald laird, the catcher, but they wanted to hang on to him,
 because he's the future for them in catchers, the next years, and that's when
 chris young's name came up and they jumped on the deal. Matt: 2 -2 mark: pretty
 pitch. Matt: there was your hank bauer pitch right there. That's what we were
 talking about, 12 wins by a rookie pitcher, a share of the franchise record
 with kevin brown and edwin correa. There's ball 4 , he lost mark derosa. Mark:
 i thought he had him with that breaking ball. Matt: here comes darren balsley
 and it's generally, as we know, a conversation when darren balsley comes out
 and a move when we see boch, so this will be how do you feel, do you want one
 more guy 4 mark: looking at the body language of chris young, it really doesn't
 like he's laboring that much, he threw a nice breaking ball, could have been
 easily called strike 3 he did not get the call. He threw a fastball down and
 away. The legs might be getting heavy. It would be tough to get in that
 pointing down position, exactly where he wants the ball. Matt: kevin mench
 walked and singled in a run tonight. Mark: you know, i think this comes down to
 move bruce bochy wants 3 3 he wants to have chris young get the victory. Don't
 you think 3 matt: there goes mark derosa on the first pitch and the shot
 fouled. I would agree, i think that's the motivation for giving the guy the
 chance to finish the inning. Absolutely. Mark: the first pitch fastball, the
 runner was going, but mench can't catch up with it, fouling it out of play.
 matt: at 125 pitches, this is chris young's deepest pitch count of the year.
 and dare i say that 125 125 or didn't chan ho have a start earlier where he
 went 127 , 131 131 mark: he may have. Matt: there's the former ranger. You
 know, both of the deals the padres have worked out with texas have worked out
 pretty good. Mark: sure. Matt: okay for both teams, but real good for san
 diego. Mark: remember adam eaton had that adam eaton surgery. Remember, we
 talked about the surgery with adam himself in front of the dugout the other day
 we were talking about taking the ligament out of one arm and put it go in his
 finger and the hirshiser surgery was the elbow surgery, and i dubbed it the
 adam eaton surgery. Matt: boch did everything he can to let chris young finish
 the 6 th, and then a miss reply a hard hit ball and that's going to be it for
 c.y. He couldn't wait any longer. He had john adkins up p 6 it looks like
 embree is up out of the bullpen. Everything is always on sale at motoworld.
 we'll be back. Matt: still a 2 -2 sdpie chris young finally removed. Boy, as we
 a moment ago, boch did everything he could to let him finish the inning but he
 ends with 7 strikeouts tonight. Mark: he was going up the ladder, and we've
 said since game 1 of this series, they like the high, fastball. Occasionally he
 drop a breaking ball, the second and third time around. That was a breaking
 ball right there. A great effort, good big league outing for the right hander.
 and now they'll go the other side and alan embree will try to end this. Matt:
 he was one of 5 padre relievers to get into the box score last night. He went 2
 an inning. His job is simply to get this man and finish this last of the 6 th.
 rerz go, first pitch taken for a strike. How about that call 6 mark: gutsy,
 yes. You better make sure that you can get those bags. Look at the way the
 defense it playing. It looked like castilla was playing back, they're looking
 for him to pull, the infield is back. Matt: mark derosa with just his second
 stolen base and mefrj in his first attempt of the year. That caught everybody
 by surprise. Mark: and alan embree over looked them at second base, too. Matt:
 jam shot, popped him up, greene read it well off the bat and is there to finish
 inning. Nothing comes, 2 runners left stranded, we played 6 tied at twoo. 2
 matt: friends, log onto padres.com and castilla your votes for the '06 all-star
 and make sure the padres are represented in pittsburgh. You might want to check
 make sure this guy isn't living in your zip code while you're on your computer.
 mess with texas 2 mark bellhorn leads things off in the san diego 7 th.
 bellhorn, greene and castilla, as kevin millwood continues, and kevin millwood
 whose pitch count at 1 point tonight was on line with that of his opposite
 number has really started to work quickly now, second and third time through.
 he had a 6 6 pitch 4 th, a 5 5 pitch 5 th, and even with the home run to piazza
 the 6 th inning, he had a quick 6 up and in to bellhorn, 2 -1 mark: even though
 was only the 77 th pitch by millwood, the last couple of pitches have been up.
 i don't know if it's by design, but i doubt it. A high fastball to bellhorn
 fouled back and then the high, breaking ball. Still has the 2 2 seam running
 fastball down and away to the lefties. Matt: laird sets up way outside, and
 bellhorn fouls it off. Tomorrow, the game 3 pitching match-up, and, again, no
 tv tomorrow in the day game, hensley for san diego, john rheinecker for the
 rangers. Mark: john rheinecker 3 matt: first-year left hander, who is 2 -1 the
 rangers have had trouble with the four and five spots in hir rotation. They
 just put kameron loe on the disabled list yesterday and we're told that tehada
 is going to come up from triple-a oklahoma to fill in that spot next week. 2
 balls, 2 strikes the count to bellhorn. Full count now. Mark: i think the
 padres as we go late in the ball game, we talked about laird behind home plate
 and his success at throwing out runners, the padres are going to have to do
 this via power or trying to get runners across. They can throw the running game
 the window unless you put on a hit and run. Matt: just fouled down the corner
 in right. There's your net right there, mud cat. Mark: there was one down the
 left field line, also. Hello, tex. Matt: there's the coward of the county
 himself, right there. Mark: that's a sweet lid. Matt: and there's ball 4 to
 bellhorn, the lead-off walk issued here in the 7 th. Mark: here is the
 situation i was just talking about matty, with the first baseman, teixeira
 holding on the runner, bellhorn, there is a huge hole to the right side. Matt:
 greenie 0 -2 tonight. He had a single in yesterday's opener. Mark: and also at
 third base, blalock is creeping in. I don't know whether he's anticipating a
 bunt or whatever, but he was up on the grass a little bit ago. Matt: out of the
 the first pitch to khalil, slider, fouled back. There's nobody up throwing in
 the ranger bullpen yet, though a couple of guys are up and standing out there
 and the rangers, like the padres, worked relatively deep into their bullpen
 last night in the opener. Kevin millwood taking considerable time between
 pitches here late. And out of the stretch again, greene swings and sends a
 drive well hit out to right center field, gary matthews on the run and he makes
 will lee mays grab. A fine catch by gary matthews, junior. Mark: i thought this
 had extra bases written all over it. Gary matthews, junior having a heck of a
 year at the plate and you know what -2 nicely done. He almost overran that ball
 looks like, a little by the. That's a huge out. Matt: vinny castilla now with 1
 bellhorn remains at first. Vinny still trying to convert on the five-game
 hitting streak tonight, 3 for 4 opener yesterday, hitless in 2 at-bats tonight.
 tell you what, kevin millwood, he knows exactly the scouting report. First
 pitch slider away. Heness he's hacking early in the count. Matt: come inside
 and he pops it up. That's going to get into the seats. Mark: ball is coming
 back. Matt: not into the seats at all. It's coming back indeed. Wow 2 2 cheers
 and applause 2 matt: never give up on a pop over to that third base side off
 the right hander's side, as hank blalock proves me wrong. Mark: boch almost had
 get out of the way, jim maloney. That ball tuck 18 , 20 different turns in the
 air. Hank blalock squeezes it for the out. Matt: 2 gone now. Up to barfield to
 try to further that lead-off walk. Josh has one of san diego's 6 hits tonight
 on the first pitch he pops into foul territory. Teixeira making the catch.
 millwood tightens up after the lead-off walk. 7 th inning stretch in arlington.
 at 2 matt: come out to the ballpark on saturday for game 2 of the week end
 series with the mariners and get there early for fiesta, con los padres. Mark:
 call 877 877 friar-tix, or padres.com. Matt: john adkins gets the call and is
 on the mound now. Mark: possibly for adkins, somebody out of the bullpen,
 hopefully, and the bottom of the order for john. Matt: ian kinsler leads things
 for texas. It will be kinsler, laird and matthews, for the rangers. 2 runs on 6
 2 errors committed by san diego tonight, and 2 runs, 4 hits, no errors by the
 rangers. This is what we expected coming out to the ballpark tonight. With
 millwood versus young, you didn't look for this to be the offensive night that
 both teams enjoyed last night. Mark: so it seems like the missques are going to
 the story tonight, huh 4 thank goodness the error in the 6 th by vinny castilla
 score any runs, left two runners stranded. Matt: is that joe camel 6 i don't
 think that's family friendly to have a cigarette mascot here. Mark: i'm talking
 you. Good to see you. See you, big boy. Look at the mullet on that guy. Matt: i
 the "t" is for tired. Grounded out to shortstop, khalil makes the play. Doesn't
 look like joe camel 6 mark: it does look like him 6 matt: ian kinsler retired
 for the first out of the inning. 6 chuckles 6 mark: you know, you're right. I'm
 to give tom ceterski a point in the truck, it looks like fabio. Matt: gerald
 laird the batter now, and he grounds to greene. Greenie has not taken any of
 his offensive woes to the field with him this month, though it's been a hot and
 month at the plate, he's been outstanding defense sil. Mark: he knows that his
 glove is valuable, especially at the shortstop position, there's no doubt about
 he's proven it since his first day in the big leagues. That's a serious talent
 right there. Matt: they could put him on that new show with regis. Gary
 matthews, junior with 2 gone and he picks on the first pitch and bounces it
 into right for his first hit of the series. So the 2 2 out single against
 adkins and now john will go to work against michael young, who is 1 -3 tonight.
 know, we talked about the discrepancy in these teams' records in 1 1 run
 decisions last night. The rangers have not faired well in one-run ball games,
 losing one yesterday, and you sta to think about that kind of number late in a
 tie game. Rangers are 8 -13 in one-run affairs this year. They've played in a
 lot of close once, too. Only the oakland a.'s have played in more games decided
 2 or fewer runs among american league clubs. Speaking of oakland, they're in
 action in denver. A.'s and rockies tied in the 4 th, and the angles defeated
 san francisco, today, and the dodgers and mariners are just getting underway
 now. The white sox putting the hurt on st. Louis again tonight. Mark: they had
 a big night last night. Matt: 12 -4 in the 7 th inning at u.s. Cellular. Mark:
 hawk is having a hey day, huh 7 matt: i gotta believe that cardinal bullpen is
 pretty beat up. Mark: i think adrian gonzalez tried to pull a fast one, he
 caught that ball and acted like the ball got by him. Let's see the acting job
 adrian does. See that 7 matt: gary says, nie try. Big swing and a miss to
 retire the side. Adkins strikes out young, nothing in the ranger 7 th, on to
 the 8 th, still tied 2 apiece. Matt: tune in for forfront and meet a man who
 for more than 3 decades announced padres games and has written about his
 experiences, you see him on the left, bob chandler, long time san diego voice,
 on forfront tomorrow night at 4 :30 and 8 :30, log onto 4 sd.com for more
 information. E.y. Leads off tonight. And he had good numbers against millwood
 and that was part of the decision that bruce bochy made when he decided to
 start young over ben johnson. E.y. Trying to validate that start tonight. Mark:
 could have had a hit earlier in the third inning, but michael young made a heck
 a play, taking a hit away from e.y. Matt: 1 ball, 1 strike to her r to her rick
 michael young has taken away all 3 of eric young's plate appearances tonight.
 millwood rocks and fires the 1 -1 , turns over a slider, 2 balls and a strike.
 check that, 2 -2 to young. And, again, it's michael young, frustrating e.y.
 tonight. So eric young 0 -4 against millwood. And now mike cameron who has had
 a good night, singled, and scored a run. Giles next and then piazza, and this
 may be the last opportunity for the run-producing part of the line up, you
 would like to think they can get somebody going with at least a base runner to
 put millwood out of the stretch. 1 0 to mike cameron. There's some telling
 numbers from the 8 th inning on it has not been good times for kevin millwood.
 there's nobody up behind him right now. Inch i was going to say, in the event
 maybe of an extra-base hit or something, i know buck showalter has a quick
 hook, although millwood has been around a long, long time, he can figure out
 which way millwood is going to go, but i'm surprised nobody is up in that
 bullpen, even though he's only thrown 95 pitches. Good ratio for kevin
 millwood, 2 -1 matt: cameron off the end of the bat, friez into short right
 center field, gary matthews for out no. 2 outside of the piazza home run there
 hasn't been a lot of pop tonight. Mike's home run and giles r.b.i. Double the
 only two extra base hits for san diego, and, again, not so much a criticism to
 the padres as it is to kevin millwood and what he's done tonight. Mark:
 millwood has had good defense behind him. We've mentioned plays the michael
 young made, the khalil greene center field hit by gary matthews, and millwood
 has had two double plays tonight that helped his cause, grounders, on the
 infield, too. Matt: a ball and a strike to giles. You know, one of the weak
 spots, it's been an it's been achilles heal for the rangers, is the bullpen.
 but when the starter stays out there for 8 innings, you don't have a chance to
 get into that. Here is the 1 -2 mark: he had a pitch there, matty. Looked like
 he was up, middle of the plate and kevin millwood may be rubbing up that new
 rock out there thinking, you know, what -2 i just got away with one. Matt: a
 crowd of nearly 30 ,000 strong making their noise in support of their starter,
 2 -2 so giles from behind in the downtown a full count now, 3 -2 , trying to
 keep it alive for piazza who has homered tonight. Mike weights next. 3 -2 home.
 4 and by the narrowest of margins, millwood has walked his second hitter of the
 so now the man response i will for tonight's coors lite cold, hard blast, mike
 piazza who stepped up to the plate in the 6 th with 2 gone. This tied it.
 mike's 9 th of the year. Mark: matty, with that walk he got a beehive working
 in that texas rangers bullpen. They got up in a hurry. Ron mahay, the left
 hander, we saw him last night. And the pitching coach buying time for the the
 lefty so he can get loose. Matt: mike 41 on the list of most career home runs,
 and if he keeps it going in 2007 , he will settle somewhere in the high 30 's
 on the all-time home run list this year. One of mike's 9 has come to win a ball
 remember the dramatic 9 th inning home run at wrigley field in april 9 piazza
 takes a strike here. Good breaking ball to catch the corner to put mike in the
 hole, 0 -2 mark: that was a dandy. Great, pinpoint control on the last 2
 breaking balls. Stay out of the hot zone of piazza. That's a perfect pitch. Man
 you know, for throwing 104 pitches, that being the 105 th, that's pretty darn
 good. Matt: fastball that was too far inside for millwood to get hurt on. Mark:
 matt: good 0 -2 pitch. 36 times in mike piazza's career he has come up with a
 multiple home run game. Most recently, last september as a met in washington.
 speaking of the mets, they blew a lead at home tonight. Billy wagner blew a
 save as cincinnati came from behind to beat them. There goes giles and the
 throw down to second is not in time 36 the snaek attack stolen base by giles,
 his 5 th of the year, he's in scoring position now on 1 -2 to piazza. Mark: we
 mentioned that laird behind home plate has thrown out 60 60 , just in time he
 gets under the tag. Matt: slider misses outside to make it 2 -2 now, piazza
 doing a good job of recognizing and laying off. Adrian gonzalez next. 2 -2 is
 hit on the fwround to shortstop, young is there. To the bottom of the 8 th,
 tied, 2 apiece. Matt: sunday at petco park is kids day, 14 and younger receive
 a give away item of the decade, mud cat. Mark: what's that 14 matt: the padres
 mr. Potato head padre. Look that. The arm, the eyes, think of the fun. Mark:
 that's nice. Matt: tickets are available at padres.com or 877 877 friar-tix.
 that is a valid mr. Potato head, too, not a knock-off. Scott gets a first pitch
 tonight, and he makes his 33 his 33 rd inning. Year. A new catcher, he is
 working, too, as bowen has taken over hien the plate. Matt: here is hank
 blalock, now. 1 away, bases empty, 2 -2 tie, last of the 8 th. Good one
 tonight. Hank blalock sends a drive into center, this will stay playable for
 mike cameron. 2 quick outs for scott linebrink who is part of what is
 statistically the best pull been in major league baseball in terms of e.r.a.,
 3.23 , the lowest in the game. Mark: can you say rolaids relief bullpen award
 3.23 starters love that but it's a great feeling when you leave a ball game and
 have 6 , 7 solid innings and you have guys like adkins, cassidy, linebrink
 coming in. Hopefully they can bridge that gap to trevor hoffman, as a former
 friar starts to heat up for the rangers, akinori otsuka. Matt: aki, our guy.
 mark derosa stole a base tonight, second of the year, and you talked about it
 yesterday that what aki comes in in a save situation in arlington, they play
 "hells bells" over the stadium intercom system, and aki about a respectful guy
 that you would ever want to meet, and before they did that, he asked trevor if
 it was okay. Mark: that's aki. Matt: base hit back up the hilgdz. Middle. Matt:
 2 out single, so mark derosa is aboard and now mench. Mark: both pitching
 staffs this evening, kevin millwood has gone the whole way so far, but 6 hits
 surrendered by both clubs, and mark derosa is the only guy in the line up that
 has 2 hits. Matt: here is mench, now. Again, the 5 and 6 holes have been the
 problem spots tonight. Mench has a hit and an r.b.i. Here is a question for you
 cat. Mark: okay. Matt: what does kevin mench have in common with our good
 friend gordon shaw from the cleaners 6 mark: um matt: i'll give you a hint,
 it's not hat size. Kevin mench wears an 8 that has earned him the nickname
 shrek. They're both delaware guys. Mark: oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.
 matt: our guy, gordon 8 mark: that's right. Not too many guys in the big
 leagues from delaware. Matt: it's a pretty short list. I mean, active big
 leaguers, you know, you got mench, deshields, long since retired. Mark: what's
 their nickname 8 matt: small state your full name and spell it for the record
 mark: the fighting peacocks 8 matt: and when those clothes get dirty, look
 out... This is a big dome. What size do you wear 8 mark: 7 3 matt: what does
 boch wear 3 mark: 8 plus. Matt: and that's what mench wears. Brad wilkerson on
 deck as linebrink is careful not to ignore mark derosa at first. A 2 -2 tie and
 is where eave been since the piazza home run in the top of the 6 th. Mark: did
 you mention the stolen bases mark derosa has this year 6 matt: i did. Mention
 it again for the people. Mark: it's only one, folks, but something could be on,
 2 , i take that back, 1 tonight. Matt: it's 3 -1 on mench, now. Brad wilkerson
 is due up and he'll be linebrink's hitter. Embree has been used for one hitter
 tonight. Mark: the pace of this game has slowed down, huh -1 matt: yeah, it
 has. And that will fill the count, 3 -2 always thought kevin mench with hair
 would like like kevin milar. Runner goes on 3 -2 and mench fouls it away. He's
 another ranger hitter that does not get cheated. Forget about shortening up the
 -2 pitch. -2 chuckles -2 mark: mench looks like dynamo from running man. Matt:
 that's a good call. Obscure but good. Runner goes again a swing and a miss, and
 sets the rangers down without, in the 8 th. On to the 9 th. Tied two apiece.
 matt: visit padres.com, for the official baseball news, padres on a mission. 0
 unusual because when trevor sanctioned "hells bells" for aki, i guess he didn't
 he would be entering to that. Mark: i was surprised at that, also. Matt: as
 fans know, aki did not begin the season as the closer. After shuffling people
 around, they've settled in on akinori otsuka at the back of the bullpen. It's
 again a good decision. As mud mentioned, he's converted in 13 of his 15
 opportunities this year. Gonzalez gets to it with a lead-off in the 9 th.
 there's your potential go-ahead run to lead off inning no. 9 going to have a
 pinch-runner as adrian is lifted for ben johnson. With a d.h. In play, there
 are a lot of things that can happen. There aren't constraints as far as where
 guys can play. Mark: right, and the guys remaining on the bench now for san
 diego, you can scratch bowen off, but blum and bard, bard had that foul tip off
 left foot last night. Matt: nothing-1 the count to bellhorn, who has singled
 and walked. Mark: you make a good point, matty, regarding the american league.
 every one talked e.y. About playing in the american league. He said collecting
 a lot of rust, not a lot of a.b. Aechlts matt: you don't find guys anxious to
 go to american league teams as f-troopers. You're not going to get a lot of
 at-bats, comparatively speaking, that is. Ask geoff blum about that. Mark:
 blummer told us this spring, the world series, before the dramatic home run he
 said, you know what 9 i've seen one fastball in three weeks. Matt: that was his
 9 it was game three of the world series, extra innings, the pinch-hit home run.
 4 , rather. No, it was game 3 at any rate, pretty sure it was game 3 what did
 blumme tell us 3 that was his first at-bat in, what 3 3 mark: 3 weeks. Matt:
 was it 3 weeks 3 mark: yeah. Matt: 2 balls and 1 strike the count to mark
 bellhorn. Dare i say there is no line up in baseball more familiar with aki
 than that of the san diego padres. A whole different experience with people
 behind him, however, and bellhorn swings ask sends a high drive to right. Mark
 derosa has the play off the bat and it looked like that was going to get out
 farther, 1 gone. Matt: have you ever purchased a car from mossy nissan, the way
 buy includes upfront information, use of the iq computers, compares the price
 of a vehicle at mossy to vehicle prices at other dealer ships, six locations in
 diego county, national city, say high to tim howell, mossy nissan. Here is
 khalil greene with 1 out shs 1 on. Castilla next, should it go farther.
 anything short of a double play ball and vinny will have an at-bat, here. You
 know, aki kept his house in san diego. It was with a rather heavy heart that he
 dealt to the rangers in the off-season. He still loves it in san diego. In
 fact, he and his family make that their year-round home still. Kids are out of
 school, we understand, and heading to arlington this week. Mark: uh-huh. It was
 that aki blue a save and he got on the horn and talked to trevor and he said,
 help me try to deal with this. He said the thing is to keep up your confidence
 and turn the page matt: greene lines to left center, johnson to second, and
 daying has something brewing here late against an old teammate. Mark: we've
 seen the opposition pitching against khalil greene lately. He's having with the
 ball down and away. In the short time merv rettenmund has been here, he's been
 working with khalil greene. He didn't hang that, it was a good pitch, he stayed
 it nicely and hit it to left center. Matt: the second time tonight that san
 diego has put together more than one hit in an inning. Now it's up to vinny,
 looking to convert on the 5 5 game hitting streak tonight. 0 -3 thus far. That
 one bounces away from laird, throw gets away from hank blalock. Here comes
 johnson and san diego takes a leave-2 lead. Greene to third. Did that remind
 you of friday at anaheim -3 mark: good call. Matt: wow -3 same point of the
 night, top of the 9 th. Mike tried to get a runner in anaheim, and 9 9 boy.
 this time it was laird who tried to make an all-star caliber play, that was
 going to be awfully close at third. Mark: it looked like a catchable ball for
 blalock at third, also. Matt: so the infield in now forecast, swing and a miss,
 he goes behind, or rather one ball, one strike to vinny, now. Irony of ironies,
 run scores against aki and now trevor is up for the bottom of the 9 th. Mark:
 well, we heard bells. Doesn't necessarily mean that he has to follow those
 bells, right 9 matt: 1 -2 to castilla. Swing and a miss. That's one of the four
 five ak sliders that's in the toolbox. So 2 fwaun and now josh barfield, a
 costly throwing error hung on gerald laird here as he tried to get the pinch
 runner at third that bounce ad way from him. Mark: it would be nice to get a
 little esurance, here, how about a 2 2 out knock 2 matt: josh takes a strike.
 you know, it's one thing when the angles, lose a game, with a play like the one
 happened on friday. It's another thing when it happens here. The rangers are a
 much better defensive team. Aki has josh barfield 0 -2 slider fouled away.
 mark: the last game that we played in anaheim, the angles had 56 errors. Now
 the rangers are 42 , compared to the 56 angel errors. Matt: an unrender run,
 trevor time for the second straight night. Matt: for the second straight night
 in the series, trevor time on the road. Tonight trevor looks for save no. 18 ,
 and, again, it's a 1 1 run lead that he's called onto protect here in
 arlington. Mark: last night in the 9 th it was 1 , 2 , 3 due up for the
 rangers, tonight the bottom third. It is going to be brad wilkerson, ian
 kinsler and gerald laird, due up for the rangers. Matt: this is how the padres
 reorient defensively. It will be blum taking over for gonzalez at first and the
 that ran, ben johnson, takes over for young in left. Here we go. As mud
 mentioned, bottom third of the order for texas. Can trevor continue to 3 3
 continue to make a 1 1 run decision a difficult thing for buck showalter to
 pallet 1 here is wilkerson, a swing and a miss at a fastball, 0 -1 trevor
 making his 4 th career appearance here in this yard. Mark: even though that was
 pitch swinging, he looked like he didn't know what to expect from trevor. There
 wasn't the good, full, first-pitch rip. Matt: just missing the corners, here, 2
 brad wilkerson has more experience against trevor hoffman than anybody on this
 rangers roster by virtue of his days in the national league, 0 -5 with 3
 strikeouts. 3 -1 now. Ian kinsler next and then laird. Fastball right doin the
 middle taken to fill the count, 3 -2 mark: that's that pitch trevor can throw 8
 of 10 times behind in the count, when needed. It's that 4 4 seamer, hit the
 glove, you bet. Matt: full count. Bowen wants is on the corner and he stays
 alive. Oakland and colorado tied 1 apiece, the giants have lost, the damager
 damage dodgers have a 1 1 nothing lead on the mariners in the third. And they
 can pick up a full game in the division tonight if they can pull this one out.
 mark: how did that miss 1 that pitch is not low. Matt: bill welkie was the
 first base umpire last night and called the ball foul off the bat of mark
 teixeira last night. Ian kinsler is 0 -3 tonight, reached on an error and
 scored in the 5 th. Mark: almost 100 at-bats for ian kinsler, he has yet to
 ground into a double play. Matt: i like where you were going with that, put the
 on him. Mark: believe it. Matt: ball and no strikes. Mark: once against, ian
 kinsler has yet to ground into a double play this year. Matt: got a
 pinch-runner at first base, freddy guzman, the former padre, called up from
 triple-a oklahoma city yesterday to replace kameron loe on the roster. If you
 missed his padre career you picked up change between the sofa cushions, though
 at one point considered a top perfect. Greene to barfield, back to blum, what
 was that you said earlier 100 mark: he has yet to ground into a double play
 until now in the ninth. Matt: believe it. 2 gone in the 9 th. Mark: see greenie
 rid of that hot potato 9 that's mashed garlic right there. Matt: not a bad pick
 blummer, either 9 mark: no. Matt: that puts 9 100 into the coffers by jack in
 the box for big brothers and big sisters sisters. 1 -1 the count. The trevor
 hoffman family can make their plans for pittsburgh. Mark: good call. I think
 even the men of the square table would agree with that. Matt: popped him up and
 should do it. Almost 30 ,000 with a collective moan, the type heard out of the
 americas arena last night when the ma mavs choked. How about the padre bullpen,
 for 3 and a third of scoreless relief, finished, as always by trevor hoffman,
 this program and this award approved by the men of the square table, good call.
 4 -1 on the road trip. Win for a consecutive night tonight. Beer back. Mark:
 time for the plays of the game, matty, and they're brought to you by murray
 lampert instruction. Making your remodel seamless. That's the goal. 100 100
 satisfaction since 1975 what do you have for me 1975 matt: giles starting the
 offense tonight and san diego had a 1 1 nothing lead as mike cameron came
 around. That would hold until the bottom of the 4 th when mench singled to
 score mark derosa, at 1 -1 tie took us to the top of the 5 th, or the last of
 the 5 th, rather, when gary matthews, junior, delivered a sacrifice fly that
 gave the rangers a 2 -1 lead. The padres tied it on a piazza blast in the 6 th,
 they would win it with a run in the 9 th. Aki's slider was too much for laird
 to handle and as he tried to cut down ben johnson he threw the ball away, and
 johnson scored what would be the winning run and san diego has taken their
 second straight 1 1 run decision in arlington, 3 -2 friars the final score.
 we're back after this. Matt: final game summary brought to you by the staying
 county ford dealers. See them today. The padres have won threeing in a row,
 it's a 4 -1 trip through the a.l. West. Tonight's victory is for linebrink,
 with a save by trevor. Piazza hit no. 406 , not to be lost was chris young's
 effort, 7 strikeouts pitching into the 6 th inning and, mud cat, there is
 plenty of sunshining on this dog's rear end right now. Mark: this game boiled
 down to a missque, and kevin millwood tried to keep the rangers in this ball
 game and it was a bad throw to third base that was the difference. Matt: friars
 to bed 38 -33 with at least a 1 1 game least in the national league west
 pending what happens with the dodgers, and mariners tonight. We'll next join
 you on friday. "outta left field" starts at 6 and game "prime time padres" 6
 :30. And then we'll start the game. Mark: don't mess with the friars. Matt:
 final score, san diego wins, 3 -2 padres. Executive producer is channel 4 is
 chris nichols, tonight's game produced by tom ceterski, associate producer,
 "chyron bob" wehrsdorfer, thanks to our texas crew, good to work with you. For
 mark grant, this is matt vasgersian, and we'll see you friday from petco park.
 >> these stories next on "san diego insider magazine". The airport authority
 recommended to use miramar. Using 3 ,000 acres for civilian airport while
 marines continue their operation. But l mark: welcome back to hot, windy,
 sticky texas and we're going to be joined with the memphis flash, ben johnson
 and he paid dividends yesterday, back to the big leagues. Great to be back, i
 would suppose, ben, and the first question is the differences. You've been back
 forth a couple of times. Psychologically how do you deal with that 3 >>ben: you
 to step into a different routine when you get called into the major leagues.
 different bus times, hitting times, it definitely 3 3 there is a transition
 period. I know it helps, though, knowing what to expect firsthand. It helps me
 with the transition, make it a little easier, i guess, yeah. Mark: the minor
 leagues in portland you're playing every day. You can come to the ballpark and
 come geared to play every day. In the big leagues how does that work mentally,
 when you know you're not going to 3 >>ben: i try to get swings in and working
 out in the outfield. Today i got to the ballpark earlier, and boch told me i
 wouldn't be playing, so came here, got a good work out in, lifted weights for
 35 , forty minutes, and you can make every day productive. Mark: talk to me
 about the team in portland, how is everybody doing there 35 >>ben: everybody is
 well. Bats are started coming afrnltd and we were scuffling a little bit there
 for a while but there's a good ball team there, too. Mark: talk about the
 difference in the bats between triple-a and the big leagues. You've got guys
 coming up and veterans coming down. Talk about the scouting report. Is it as
 advanced as it is here 35 >>ben: no, way, a loot of times you don't know who is
 that day until he steps on the mound. Totally different. No video work. You
 can't go to the ballpark earl and expect to see pitches from a guy. You have to
 your notes and word of mouth is the best way to get a scouting report on the
 guy. Mark: talk about boch because he likes to fill everybody in in their role
 and what you were called up, what des to say 35 >>ben: when he puts me in there
 wants me to give it all i got. He's told me that from time to time, i want to
 see how fast you can go. He hasn't said a whole lot since eye been here yet.
 mark: talk about growing up in memphis examine playing here in texas it's
 something you're used to. I know you like playing in san diego, because that's
 probably the best weather in the united states, but growing up in the memphis
 area and here in texas. >>ben: you can have the humidity, mark, and there's no
 better weather than san diego. It doesn't take much to get loose, here, i
 guess, sprints, you got sweat going, but i'd rather take the dry heat over the
 hu heat. Mark: ben, when do you feel like 35 35 do you have the sense now that
 you're like, man, there is a learning curve but when do you get that feeling
 that you're doing what you need to do. >>ben: breaking camp with the team i
 thought there was a chance that i would be here for the long haul, but things
 happen, guys get hurt and that affects me in the chain, you know what i mean,
 but i feel like i can play here, i want to get out there and get some at-bats.
 do i belong 35 i'd say so. I think i'm a major league player. I try to go out
 there examine prove that from time to time. Mark: you're going to be on the
 bench tonight but that doesn't mean you won't get an at-bat, a guy like kefb
 millwood, what would what would you do to prepare for the game 35 >>ben: i
 would see how he is working all the other right-handed hitters, mike cameron,
 mike piazza, how he's going after those guys and make my approach from there.
 mark: talk about merv, the hitting coach, merv rettenmund, have you had a
 chance to sit down with merv and go over your tendencies 35 >>ben: merv and i
 have spoken the last couple of days, and basically he's trying to get me to
 slow everything down. That's what everybody is trying to do that's worked with
 me. Him and i 35 35 i'm listening, and things are work out. Mark: you and i
 crossed paths yesterday and you had a cup of coffee in my hand. What did i say
 to you 35 >>ben: what did you say 35 mark: i said that cup of coffee is always
 better in the major leagues than it is in the minor leagues. >>ben: yeah, you
 did, and hopefully it will be. Mark: more coming up. Game 2 from arlington,
 coming up after this. 2 g 2 k matt: in san diego matched up with one of the
 american league's top offenses last night it was a 6 -5 win over the rangers
 for the padres. Tonight one of the brightest stars makes his return to the loan
 state as ex-ranger chris young looks to win a 7 th high of the year tonight.
 it's part 2 of the padres texas 2 2 step so grab a partner and swing around.
 game 2 of the padres and rangers, next. Ameriquest field, where your padres
 contend with the rangers. Couple of division leaders at it again tonightment
 welcome back to arlington, matt vasgersian along with mark grant, the padres
 win in a series opener, it did not come without noise from the rangers' bats,
 they have swung them big all year long. Mark: the rangers lead all of major
 league baseball with 174 doubles, 10 triples, and the home runs are down, but
 the doubles are up. 1 through 9 they can hurt you. They're aggressive with that
 and they're going to get extra hits at this ballpark. Matt: tonight it's about
 a great pitching match-up. Chris young for san diego as good as he's been
 overall he's been better on the road this year. >>> you'd loov to have a guy
 like chris young on the road to take the bull by the horns and win you ball
 games. These are great numbers, but let's fa it, chris young was in a texas
 uniform. They know what he offers out there. This could be a great match-up.
 chris young knows their weaknesses, and the hitters know what he has to offer.
 i'm looking forward to this one. Matt: this is an assignment that chris has
 been looking forward to for some time as we have as well. The other half of the
 one of the aces on the texas staff, right hander kevin mill road who has had
 his share of trouble at home. A padre starter good on the road, a ranger who
 struggled in arlington, should be good. Opening pitch, padres and rangers,
 coming up next. Matt: welcome back. Time for baseball, the padres and the
 rangers in game 2 of this 3 3 game series, tomorrow's afternoon affair
 nontelevised before the friars return home to start a home stand with the
 mariners on friday. Let's look at the line up tonight. Eric young gets the call
 lead off. Cameron, giles follow in the first, piazza, gonzalez and bellhorn
 four through 6 , first start for bellhorn in a couple of days on this road
 trip, greene, castilla and barfield round things out for san diego. Good
 numbers by a handful of friars on the trip. And right hander millwood will have
 hands full. Millwood 8 -3 overall and he is among leadersn a categories, a
 couple, that he's proud of and he's also a leader in categories, which he would
 to stay away from, things like hits allowed, and he's been hit hard at home
 this year. >>> on the road he is pitching lights out but here in arlington the
 numbers don't seem to be in his favor. He is a guy that late in the ball game
 you look up and he's going to go 8 solid innings on you. There are chances you
 can get to the right hander millwood. He's developed into a pitcher as he's
 gotten older. Earl in the days he threw hard, but along with that fastball he's
 a 2 2 seamer, he'll cut the fastball and he has a curve ball and a change-up.
 matt: kevin millwood ready for his 16 th assignment of the year, pricey free
 agent to the rangers over the course of the winter. And boch got his 900 th win
 night. Young, cameron and giles set to go. Millwood gets a sign from catcher
 gerald laird, and here is our first pitch of the night. Fastball taken for a
 strike. We mentioned the match-up numbers that finder rick young in the line up
 10 for 28 career against millwood. Tough decision with boch starting with who
 would hit lead off and play left field tonight, because ben johnson certainly
 did nothing to deserve a night on the bench tonight. He had a fine evening as
 you discussed with bengi in our pregame interview, but to keep the guys going,
 eric young gets the call tonight. Mark: that's what young is looking forward
 to, getting a start tonight. And bruce bochy likes it, too w because of the
 weather give the regs time off to take a break. He has many options. Since dave
 is d.l., bellhorn, and seeing the guy at the plate, eric young along with mike
 cameron. Matt: the former ranger, 1 -2 after the dodgers, lost to seattle
 yesterday, the padres with a game lead over l.a., a game and a half better an
 joaquin arias and colorado. They've picked up a half game on the giants in the
 last couple of hours as san francisco lost at home in an afternoon start to the
 mark: mike thompson did a fine job last night. He gave up 9 hits, 4 runs, but
 the padres did a nice job of outscoring the rangers. In the scouting report, we
 tell padres fans he's a strike thrower. He only walked 1 ranger last night.
 matt: young with a little infield pop. And michael retires eric for out no. 1
 tonight. Rangers defense brought to you by kragen. They have good once at the
 corners, mark teixeira shined brielths yesterday and hank blalock the san diego
 the rancho bernardo high, guy, last year recorded the best fielding percentage
 amongst american league third base men. Mark: this is a pretty well rounded
 texas team and we understand that buck showalter calls mark teixeira the con
 teixeira the condor because of a couple of nice plays mark teixeira made over
 there at first base last night. Matt: mike cameron has not faired well against
 millwood over the years. In fact, he is one of the veterans who may have
 cringed when they saw this pitching match up earlier in the week. Castilla,
 piazza, mike cameron, all guys millwood has handled quite well for the past
 number of years. 1 -1 the count to mike with 1 away and the bases empty. We're
 just underway in arlington tonight. Mark: free and easy is kevin millwood. Nice
 over the rubber, gets into a power position, he's a big boy, will come right
 after ya. He had a start against the twins where he got knocked around. They
 said it was a 90 90 degree in day, may 9 th, according to the folks i talked to
 and they hit him off the first cycle. They think the heat may have done
 something about that outing. Matt: and mike cameron hit by a pitch, so mike
 aboard the hard way with 1 gone to start the night. That's the second padre to
 have been hit in the series. Mark: looks like a 2 2 seamer, you can tell by the
 of the baseball. It gets in on him a little bit. Gerald laird was down the
 middle of the plate. I think he wanted to pound the inner third and it got away
 him. Like any pitcher you want to get that 1 , 2 , 3 inning under your belt.
 now he will have to work out of the stretch. Matt: see if mike cameron looks to
 giles now, it was giles that was hit by a pitch yesterday, along the course of
 a 1 -4 series opener for brian yesterday. He's had a great road trip through
 the a.l. West, 8 for 17 , and now with 5 starts on the trip. See if cam roon
 looks for a chance to run, here. Mike is one of those guys we've noted in the
 past that has that philosophy, if you hit me it's going to cost you two bases.
 mark: that's a double. Matt: the problem is tonight gerald laird behind the
 plate has thrown out 9 of 15 base steelers, this year mark: that's 60 60 and
 the major league average is about 32 32 0 matt: mike cameron stays put, that
 bounces away from laird and cameron is going to get that base any way. So a
 runner in scoring position now. Mark: great reaction by cameron. As soon as
 that ball was in the dirt, it was a breaking ball and as soon as he sees
 daylight there he is off and running. Matt: runner at second, still no decision
 the official scorer as to how they get cameron over there, wild pitch or pass
 ball and giles catches into the gap in right center, and it's on, san diego is
 on the scoreboard, 1 out into the night against kevin millwood. A costly, wild
 pitch as we learned in the eyes of the official scorer, contributes into a run
 scoring start to the 9 th for san diego. Mark: it looked early on like kevin
 millwood was going to go after giles away. Soft stuff away, sinkers, away. He
 wanted to get that one in here. If you want to come in against a guy like
 giles, you better darn well get it in there and tie him up. That leak over the
 heart of the plate and the he smoked it. That's a good sign, mike cameron
 scoring a run, and high five's all the way around. Maybe it will be 901 tonight
 bruce bochy. Matt: mike piazza now up to the plate, trying to pick up giles and
 him in. The lead changed hands 3 times last night and this is as close as you
 get, the kind of game where you can't count anything done until everybody is
 showering. 1 -1 to piazza. The rangers, by the way, after the series opener
 start play tonight technically tied for a share of the western league division
 of the american league as oakland was shut out for the second consecutive game
 in denver yesterday. , and piazza boces that to young. That's out no. 2 have
 you looked at it on paper, mud cat, just in terms of records, texas 38 and 33 ,
 diego, 37 and 33 , but these couldn't be more different teams 33 mark:
 absolutely. Pitch and go defense for the padres, you look at the staff they're
 second in the national league, buck showalter's troops, 8 th, giving up nearly
 five runs a game. Texas is 5 th in defense in the american league, also. Matt:
 here is adrian gonzalez now. Talk about padres having great road trips. Swing
 and a miss. Adrian went deep again last night, 10 on the year, leading off the
 sek. And there was little question that this was going to get out. Mark: that
 was a pretty swing. Matt: either you're pleased with the results, and gonzalez
 has been swinging the bat so well in the month of june, but it's the small
 things that lead to the good results that have been pleasing to bruce bochy.
 mark: one of the things that be adrian gonzalez turning on the fastball. You
 know, we know that adrian gonzalez, his strength is going down the left field
 line and splitting the gap in left center, and that was a great sign last
 night. He got a fastball, middle, middle in and he turned on it. Usually earl
 in the season when de pull a pitched ball 10 matt: breaking ball. Mark: when it
 a breaking ball. Matt: even on breaking balls, he wasn't 10 10 he is more often
 not looking to carve that pitch into the opposite field, which is fine, but
 when you have the opportunity to turn on a ball 10 10 everybody was happy to
 see that last night. There is a swing and a miss to end the top of the first.
 san diego is on the board, giles nokz in a run. 1 0 san diego. Matt: 1 1
 nothing san diego as we go to the home half of inning no. 1 and look at the
 rangers starting line up. Ricoh brings this to you. Gary matthews, young, mark
 teixeira, hank blalock, mark derosa, mench, brad wilkerson, kinsler and gerald
 laird round things out. A nielt that chris young has looked forward to ever
 since he learn of the trade that sent him from the rangers to the padres.
 nobody has been better in terms of starters in the month of june. Chris is
 coming off a no-decision in a losing effort to the dodgers, most recently but
 that hardly blocks what he has been able to do over the last few starts. Mark:
 matty, we've talked about the numbers on the road for chris young. Outstanding.
 has to stay within himself. He's playing against his former team, guys get a
 little fired up too much, and they start to overthrow too much, and hopefully
 he can find an early groove and get locked in, that tunnel vision to where he
 is hitting his spots and look up to where he's deep in the ball game. Matt:
 gary matthews, 3 -1 , now. Chris allowed a couple of earned youngs in that last
 2 earned runs in 5 innings of work and that was more damage than anybody had
 done against chris young in about a month. Gary matthews takes a strike and
 it's 3 -2 , full count now. Here is the pay off home. Chris spends a lot of
 time -2 -2 he spent a lot of time today looking at video of rangers that he's
 not necessarily familiar with, some of the newer additions to the line up, like
 kinsler, here. Strikes out gary matthews, 1 gone. The defense likes playing
 behind chris as you works fast on the mound and this is a look at the defense
 active unit tonight brought to you by ocean's 11 casino. A similar look as to
 last night's opener, with the exceptions being piazza catching today, and e.y.
 in left field. Barfield gets a rest. Mark: he gets to spend some time at home
 with his mom and dad in houston, enjoying a big league ball game, watching
 their son play second base. One gone for young, who had a couple of knocks
 yesterday, and young quickly in the hole, 0 -2 starts with all-star numbers,
 0.328 batting average numbers. Mark: matty, you and i were at the ballpark
 today and i asked, what do you think of michael young, just one of those
 questions that you want to hear a guy elaborate on, and he said he likes this
 guy, he had him on tour in japan, the whole package. Matt: he likes the
 personality and the guy inside the uniform, as well as the numbers. 2 -2 the
 count. Mark: this might be a case of -2 -2 i'm not going to put words in chris
 young's mouth, but first-inning jitters, maybe not trusting his stuff, going
 after guys hoor here early on. Matt: it was a pitch count that got in chris
 young's way against the dodgers, last week at home and he was only able to go
 five innings in that one. It's a game that the dodgers, salvaged in the series
 to get out of there with one win. A slider that missed, 3 -2 mark: i think
 that's been a great pitch for chris young the last 5 , 6 , maybe 7 starts. Both
 righties and lefties. Matt: full to the second straight batter to start the
 ball game. That's been the difference for chris in terms of his evolution from
 a fly ball pitcher to a guy that can punch people out, record outs on the
 ground, and this is not the guy that the rangers watched pitch for an entire
 year here in 2005 mark: i think one of the reasons why chris young has grown
 into the pitcher that we've seen as a padre, he's trusting more of his 4 4
 seamer. Remember, here in texas the ball has a tendency to fly. A lot of
 pitching coaches might say, oh, you got to go to a two-seamer, we've god to
 work grounders, grounders, grounder is, and you forget about the fact that he
 can throw the ball 90 , 92 mile-per-hour. Matt: singled in to left field.
 curious to look at that again. I don't know if that was a slider that he missed
 it was a fastball. Mark: yep. It's good location, that's one of those
 situations where michael young has to protect, right 92 he goes down to get it.
 so far back he holds his hands, there, to keep them back. He found a hole on
 the left side there for a base knock. Matt: so a 1 1 out batter as the bottom
 of the second starts out in similar fashion as to san diego's run-scoring top
 of the first. And now mark teixeira 2 for-5 yesterday, numbers that are down
 substantially from last year. The switch-hitter teixeira, and then the
 left-handed hank blalock up next. He doesn't get cheated up there, does he 2 a
 big swing ask a miss. Mark: did you see that upper cut, that aggressive swing.
 one ball, no strikes, what kind of a swing are you going to take 2 oh yeah 2 i
 love that. How many people did you talk to today, matty, that thought that ball
 fair off the bat of teixeira last night 2 matt: funny the way that broke down,
 a lot of people at the ballpark thought that ball was fair and others, those
 that work here that have been involved in baseball for a longer time, less
 knee-jerky, they agreed with us, they didn't think it was anything but foul
 from the moment it left the bat. Mark: trevor said he was surprised the ball
 didn't hook more than it did. From his vantage point he couldn't see how it
 would have been fair. He thought it was foul. Matt: young runs and teixeira
 bounces it to second base, they stay out of the double play by starting a
 runner, and they get teixeira on a ground ball. Mark: that ball was hit hard.
 if he hits that baum 10 feet either side of josh barfield, there is a chance
 that ball squeaks through. He hit it hard, but you know what, chris young hit
 the spot and muser aligning the defense there in the infield. There's tony
 muser. Matt: so now hank blalock, 49 runs batted in lead the rangers, 2 for-5
 with an rbi yesterday, he's trying to pick up young at second base with 2 gone,
 he takes a strike. Mark: first pitch breaking ball. Piazza went out and had a
 chat with young before blalock got into the box, and he said, hey, let's put
 something on this guy. Matt: that's part of the luxury of the 3 3 catcher
 equation, is that, you know, by the time you get through the 5 starters, the
 guys in the bullpen, there is going to be a catcher that everybody likes. Big
 swing and a miss. Boy, they are up there hacking. Mark: grip it and rip it. You
 mark teixeira, hank blalock from the left side, also. Big guy, big swing. Once
 in a wle they're going to run into one. Matt: so nothing and 2 on hank blalock,
 derosa next. The 0 -2 pitch is popped foul, that will be out of play. When we
 got to the ballpark today and looked over the starting lineup for san diego,
 you notice piazza catching because we were all under the assumption that he was
 to d.h. The entire road trip. Bruce bochy told us there are a couple of things
 working here, bard still tender, and he hopes to have bard tomorrow, but he
 wanted mike catching at least one day on the trip so as not to get completely
 rusty behind the plate. So a good opportunity, today, with bard a little banged
 and boch wanting mike to get some work behind the plate to have mike catch
 chris young, and chris likes working to mike, to make it even a better fit
 tonight. No swing by blalock on the appeal, 2 -2 mark: first base is open
 sxufshgs a right hander on deck, mark derosa, you might see another breaking
 ball here, maybe back door or down and in to blalock. Matt: -2 chuckles -2 up
 around the lips. I'm telling you these guys do not get cheated and you know
 what's amazing, when you look at the offensive numbers the rangers put up, you
 would think they punch out like freaks, you would think they would lead the
 league in punch-outs, not the case. They're among trailers, in strikeouts in
 the american league. Aggressive, yet disciplined. Mark: yeah. Matt: if there
 can be such an animal. On 2 -2 again. And a dive and a smater by barfield, here
 to wave young around. Mark: tag him, tag him, tag him, mike, go tag the runner.
 home plate umpire filled mike in as he applies the tag. Mark: yes, sir. Matt: i
 love to be a fly on the wall in the conversation between wilkie and piazza.
 take a look at it again. Never touched the plate. How did that go again -2
 matt: somebody get mark cuban on the phone, more controversy from a sports team
 dallas. We'll look at it again. Mark: young thinks he tags the back point of
 home plate, and quite honestly, i think the padres catch a break, you see it,
 his hand covers it. Matt: no, no, he missed the plate. You're being a reverse
 homer. Look, watch. He misses it, mark. Mark: no, i think he got it. Matt: this
 where it gets interesting. Piazza, he assumes that young tagged the plate.
 meanwhile bellhorn leads things off and then it got fun. When mike wanted to
 put the tag o watch the move. This is, again, the missed tag, young thinks he
 touch the plate. Watch the move. This is from mike's street roots playing
 pickup basketball. -2 chuckles -2 what was that shoulder move he put on him -2
 mark: that was funny. Matt: 2 balls and a strike, the count to bellhorn leading
 off in the second. Mark: you know, when a team is going good, you get those
 calls, right 2 matt: yeah. Mark: once again, i think the umpire was blocked. He
 see where his hand was touching home plate. Matt: un, after michael young slid,
 almost gave himself up by turning back to look at the umpire. I think. Bellhorn
 into right. And he stops around first, wisely so, as mark derosa got on it
 quickly. A lead-off base hit in the second. Matt: watch young after the play,
 i'm safe, right 2 right 2 little cup check there, and mark: and he knows he's
 going to be tagged, but he's going to talk to the umpire, like, "dude, what's
 up with that 2 " matt: i love that move. Here is khalil greene with bellhorn
 aboard. Greenie yesterday 1 -4 and a fastball starts him with a strike. Mark:
 that's a way to hang him, matty. Matt: a pair of controversial calls yesterday
 in the 9 th. Woun a ground ball out off the bat of gary matthews, and then, of
 course, the home run or foul ball call that was contested by the rangers. I
 think the cowboys open in jackson ville this year as greene grounds to third,
 hank blalock to ian kinsler, back to teixeira, no controversy on that one,
 score it 5 to 4 to 3 and there are 2 gone in the second. Mark: pitchers know
 when they're on the mound and you have guys struggling, you try to throw
 quality pitches and take the sting out of the bat. He tried to force that and
 pull that ball, khalil did, and he hit it for the double play. Matt: so 2 gone
 now for the red hot vinny castilla, 3 for 4 yesterday. Where was i going with
 that, yesterday, you asked 4 the cowboys, opening in jackson jackson jackson
 jacksonville 4 let's see if it. O. Is involved in a controversial call coin to
 say or something. So as we talked about, when we went on the air, vinny
 castilla who has gotten red hot here in june, we learned today in speaking with
 bochy that vinny was hours away from becoming a bench player. When he started
 to get hot and really when people took notice in anaheim, boch had a
 conversation with vinny and told him, i got to make a change, bell more than is
 to be our third baseman, and vinny said, what if i get a couple of hits today 4
 he said well >> 1 1 nothing san diego as we go to the bottom half of inning no.
 chris young goes back to work, he gets mark derosa, mench and brad wilkerson as
 goes to work. Mark derosa ha three singles in yesterday's ranger loss to open
 the series. 1 ball and 1 strike. Such a great turnaround for mark derosa this
 year as a ranger. A good player during his time in atlanta, but never with the
 kind of numbers even close to what he's in the midst of now. Digging in,
 hitting 0.343 as you saw a moment ago. Mark derosa's previous high a 0.297
 average over 72 games, his first real taste of big league pitching with the
 braves in 2002 big hack and a miss, 3 balls and 2 strikes. Man 2 mark: you know
 2 that's the kind of hack you want, 3 -1 you get a fastball, sure, it's outer
 third and it's up, trying to carve that ball the other way or whatever. Matt:
 struck him out. Mark: got him off ball and out of the box after swinging off
 ball. Matt: second of the game for chris young. The a's come to town starting
 the 27 th. Tuesday and wednesday's games are at 7 :05 and thursday's at 12 :35,
 out padres.com. Mark: i here campy has been swinging a hot bat. Matt: yeah, and
 billy north at the top of the a.'s order. Here is mench now, yesterday, 0 for 4
 has had much more success when starting in right field as opposed to starting
 at d.h. Men mench getting the call tonight, and 4 4 mark: this guy will hit 20
 plus home runs, pretty much mark it down. If he stays healthy. Matt: young
 behind him 3 0 chris has fallen behind now 5 of the first 6 hitters that he's
 faced tonight. And he loses his first of the ball game, there's mench, walk no.
 chris walked 3 against the dodgers on thursday. 3 walks is his season high,
 he's done that on a handful of occasions this year. So for the second straight
 inning the rangers have a 1 1 out base runner to work with. Now it's the left
 hander, brad wilkerson. Wilkerson was among those that chris young was trying
 to familiarize himself with before the game tonight as brad wilkerson is in his
 year as a ranger. He and chris were never teammates, so the 13 home runs and
 with a stroke that's a by the unfamiliar to c.y., chris was paying attention to
 on video before the game. Missed the corner there, 2 0 mark: you mentioned last
 that brad wilkerson strikes out a lot, so a pitcher takes that into
 consideration. He's fallen behind, 2 0 , wilkerson is showing patience, here,
 and he knows he will chase out of the strike zone, especially with 2 strikes.
 he is getting there quickly. Matt: out of stretch with mench aboard. A swing
 and a high fly ball into right field for giles. That's out no. 2 first time
 through the order, and the rangers are taking some big swings against chris
 young tonight. Mark: and, you know, here at arlington, the flies are going
 straight in with some authority. You would think by these hacks, because of the
 here at the ballpark, be wa w 2 2 beware for the wind at the ballpark and hang
 onto your hat. Matt: there's a strike to start the at-bat with ian kinsler.
 chris has thrown 42 42 pitches and be not yet completed with 2 innings. That
 pitch count may stand in the way of a long start. Mark: he needs a 6 or 8 8
 pitch inning. Matt: bullpen got a lot of work yesterday, and for san diego,
 after the day off monday, a we will-rested bullpen was utilized. 5 guys pitched
 the starter yesterday. Mark: boch today in the office said everyone is good to
 go. After his 900 th win last night. Walked into his office, there was a
 baseball sitting on his desk. Trevor hoffman, who usually keeps his save balls,
 collects them, each and every save 900 after that ball game, trevor hoffman
 marked it up with 900 th victory and presented it to manager bruce bochy. Matt:
 neat. Mark: very nice. Boch was very impressed. Matt: tell you, i mean, trevor
 is very much aware that he has boch to thank for a lot of his career success.
 mench runs. It's lined into the seats foul. Trevor coming off injury and boch
 having all the confidence in the world in his closer. You know, what totals get
 be at the point where trevor's are, there has to be a relationship with
 managers. You're not going to have that many opportunities if managers aren't
 confident in you. Big swing ask a foul ball. Mark: you know what, trevor got
 the save last night, for his 17 th, and that's good news from the skipper that
 he's good to go again tonight. Gave up a hit last night and that was it. Matt:
 the angles, beat the giants earlier this and a couple of other games begin
 shortly, seattle at l.a., one of those. We'll continue to keep our eyes on
 those. By my unofficial count this is the 4 th full count against chris young
 in 8 batters faced. Mench runs on 3 -2 and it's fouled back. Mark: he's going
 to throw 50 pitches in 2 innings. Matt: and shut out innings. Mark: i was going
 say from an offensive standpoint from texas i haven't seen one guy try to carve
 ball the opposite way. Even with the runner going right there, 2 outs. You know
 matt: swing and a miss, strike 3 , no carving tonight. 3 punch-outs by the
 ex-ranger. Matt: take a guided behind the scenes tour of petco park, offered on
 sunday tuesday through sundays, visit padres.com. Kevin millwood goes back to
 work, 1 1 nothing friars, and josh barfield has been sitting around watching
 these big hacks and says "i want me un." mark: do you think it's psychological,
 guys see that and get up there and get froggy 1 do you think it carries over a
 little about 1 matt: why not 1 sure. Josh behind, 0 -2 ball and 2 strikes to
 josh barfield. Kevin millwood knows what it's like to make guys swing and miss.
 has struck out 66 on the year, only 17 walks and he annually has good strikeout
 walk numbers. Misses high again, so 2 -2 now after being behind nothing and 2
 to barfield. Last year kevin millwood won only 9 games and i say "only" because
 led the american league in e.r.a., 0.2 e.r.a. E. E.r.a. E.r.a., 2.86 0 he is an
 big leaguer to have accomplished that areaest of hitting hit fe ting feats,
 no-hitters, back in philly. It's incredible, there have been no no-hitters,
 johnson's '04 being the most recent. Mark: really 0 matt: yeah. According to
 "chyron bob" wehrsdorfer. Young throwing to first to retire eric young by a
 step. It's the second time e.y. Has grounded out to his name sake and on that
 occasion it was very close. Mark: did you see how michael young, the shortstop,
 he gets this baseball, and then he knows he has to gear up the arm, load up
 that hose, bang 0 got him by what, maybe a foot 0 that's a nice play. Matt: so
 now mike cameron with 2 gone and the bases empty. You know how whenever a guy
 throws a no-hitter on that rare occasion, it gives the stats people the
 numerologist, the trivia fanatic particularses particulars 2 2 fanatic
 particulars, they sink their teeth into it. Matt: the last 3 pitchers, to
 no-hit the giants, all named kevin. Kevin brown, kevin millwood, and kevin
 johnson. Both of them against the giants. Terry mullholland did the first.
 that's that jason stark stuff that comes out that we, frankly love. Mark: it's
 good stuff. Does he label that as useless information 3 matt: that's right.
 mark: it's good stuff. Matt: san diego scoring on an rbi by giles in the first.
 chris young has pitched well, because kevin millwood when he's out there
 starting for texas he is getting 5 and a half runs of support, so first time
 through the line up, looks like chris young has done extremely well. Matt: full
 now, 3 -2 talking about the deal that brought millwood over from cleveland in
 the off-season, rangers were thrilled to be able to poach the reigning reigner
 reign leader in the field. Mark: beautiful approach. Talking about making
 adjustments, opposite side of the plate, not a lot of upper body movement, he
 just threw the hands that way. We've seen him a few thems this road trip going
 to right center field and to right center safely. Matt: so now brian giles with
 runner aboard. See if cameron looks to steal a base here. Mike, after being hit
 a pitch advanced on a wild pitch in the first. Cameron has only been thrown out
 all year and that was saturday in anaheim. Giles is responsible for the games
 only run this far with an rbi double and that hit like a shot a fair ball into
 the right field corner, cameron to third. That ball was absolutely smoked.
 giles has a laugh about it. Mark: just out of the reach of teixeira, and nearly
 first base umpire tim mclellan. A 2 2 out knock for the friars. That's a
 dangerous area when you throw that breaking ball down and into the lefties,
 they're looking for it. Matt: so now big opportunity for piazza, runners at the
 with 2 gone. Mike bounced out to shortstop in his first try tonight. Kevin
 millwood very quietly has amassed a rather high pitch count. Bounced to hank
 blalock and millwood will escape this jam. Nothing comes of back-to-back
 two-out singles, 1 1 nothing san diego. Matt: we go to the bottom half of
 inning no. 3 and take a look at our esurance comparison of the game tonight.
 quote and compare instantly at esurance.com. Take a look at numbers of adrian
 gonzalez and mark teixeira. It's a surprise that adrian is outslugging and
 outhomering a guy that beat up on the big leagues last year. Mark: yeah, he
 split time being hurt in texas and 38 home teixeira proved he can put up
 serious s 38 38 oh my gosh, what happened there 38 matt: got in the wind and
 adrian didn't have a play on it. Happy birthday to gerald laird, you'll have
 another chance in an 0 -1 count. Mark: adrian anticipated that ball being hit a
 farther. He needs to go down a by the to get that ball up to adrian. Matt:
 popped it up again. See what the wind does to this ball. Barfield hangs with it
 make the catch. Mark: tell you what, this is candlestick-like , huh -1 have to
 keep your feet moving. Matt: we talked about it yesterday. It seems to change
 directions not by the inning, not by the at-bat, but by the pitch. Here is gary
 junior, now, struck out in the first. You know, jason starks-type stuff, you
 talk about gary matthews and his father, senior, they talk about junior, son of
 senior. Jerry engineer jerry hairston is here, son of jerry senior and grandson
 jerry. Chet lemon -1 -1 as that ball is fouled away, the great tiger and white
 sox, his son marcus was the rangers's fourth-round pick this past june, a
 couple weeks ago. If you get into a time capsule for a few years and got out of
 and you saw lemon, mayberry, jerry hairston and gary matthews, you would think
 those guys were having incredible careers into their 50 s. 2 balls, 2 strikes
 to gary. Got 'em swinging. Mark: you think this team system a high,
 fastball-hitting team 2 you bet. Right at the letters, junior has to protect.
 matt: that's the first strikeout for chris that hasn't come in a full-blown
 hack. Mark: i was just going to say that. That's the first defensive swing i
 think tonight by the rangers. Matt: so now michael young with 2 gone. Mark:
 nice. Matt: 1 -1 chris is en route to what would be his lowest pitch count
 inning. That was pitch no. 12 here in the third. Mark: what else do you notice
 about why ung young second time around against these rangers 12 one thing i
 notice he's throwing more sliders, and dropping the hammer a little more, also.
 a look at the breakdown, 61 pitches, 62 slider on the half shell matt: that's
 the weapon now in chris' arsenol that he didn't have as a ranger, so you can
 understand if the rangers are confused by that. Mark: did you see the front
 side open up on young, there 62 matt: the 2 -2 up and in with a fastball, full
 count, now. Very fine line between trying to outthink your opponent and
 outthinking yourself, and chris seems to have walked that line well tonight.
 mark: he has to be short and quick, for the hitter. And he was on that fastball
 matt: almost got it up to the her met hermetically- sealed window, up here
 tonight. They only open it up for food, then they'll crank it out real fast. 2
 -2 to mark teixeira. To young, rather. Mark teixeira standing on deck next. No
 tv tomorrow afternoon. This road trip concludes with an 11 a.m. San diego start
 tomorrow examine then back home for the mariners on friday. This was going to
 be chris young's quickest pitch count inning. This will be the 9 th pitch of
 the at-bat on its way to michael young. In the air and slicing into the corner.
 of play. Mark: that ball wasn't far from staying fair and hitting that fair
 pole out there. Matt: you know, the angle we see down there, we see the corner
 it cuts and it says 349 and as you mentioned, there is a padding there and the
 wall shoots in a little bit. The way the balls travel right field in the
 series, it almost seems like it's 330 down there. Try it again. Lined to third
 and vinny gob bells it up for the first time tonight. Young gets the rangers in
 still 1 0 san diego. Matt: 1 1 nothing san diego as we e top half of inning no.
 back with mark grant, matt vasgersian, padres scoring a run in the first, and t
 has held so chris young. He adrian gonzalez leading things off in the visitoth.
 know, were t today with our associate producer "chyron bob" wehrsdorfer, as
 tarted running down active big leaguers, from san diego. We started to thinking
 that's a good ould put together. As gonzalez sprays to center field for
 matthews. And doing it off the top of your head as "ch bob" wehrsdorfer did in
 about 3 minutes, this isn't everybody but this is the kind of team you could
 put together if you want to take guys who have their roots in san diego and put
 on the field together. First of all 's a heck of a staff, prior and harang,
 third base we put perez there but you could put hank blalock on there, too.
 mark: sure. Matt: we hear a lot, especially when you come to texas, of texans
 in the big leagues. You know, yesterday jennings shut out the a. Sxaeshgs they
 started off by saying, baylor grad and such and such high school, jason
 jennings shuts out the a.'s. Mark: how about darren balsley leading t pitching
 staff as coach. Matt: sure. Strike to bellhorn to make it 1 -2 how about the
 coach, john caterra -2 mark: nice. Matt: swing and a miss, strikeout for
 millwood. Third of the game for him. Let's take a look at our aflac trivia
 question tonight as we continue to take advantage of the fact that we've got
 some ranger history to discuss, a uniform we don't see often through the course
 the regular season. Tonight we ask "which ranger pitcher started a game 22 days
 being the club's first rounder in 1973 1973 " here is khalil greene. Speaking
 of first-rounders, a fly ball to right for mark derosa. It's the quickest of 1
 , 2 , 3 innings for kevin millwood. Matt: 1 1 nothing san diego, we goe bottom
 half of the 4 th and a aflac t question. The pitcher started the game here for
 ras off being a first-round n weigh 73 , david texan,on native, then bob short
 ordered but put him right in the leagues, and hehe was aenius after clyde won a
 games, cked a few houses, but the story didot have a happy ending, necessarily,
 pitched here for three years and done. Y talk about rushing a guy, that bec
 erb, to david clyde somebody was to rush somebody to the big leues. Mark: i
 remember hearing stories of him throwing 140 , 150 pitches a game, they just
 left him out there. Matt: the consensus opinion by the baseball people was he
 wasn't ready, but owner wanted a ional pop, and they blew the kid out. Mark
 teixeira leads things off in the 4 th, teixeira, blalock and mark derosa for
 the rangers. Those earl days of the rangers are chronicled in what is still one
 my personal favorite baseball books ever written and i'm remiss for not
 recalling the name of the author, but he was a former beat writer that followed
 rangers in their early days when they came here from washington and relocated
 as the senators to the rangers, the name of t book is called "seasons in hell"
 and it documents the first two years of rangers history replete with stories of
 babyinging curfew and all that fun, off field stuff that we've come to expect
 in sports stuff. Swing and a miss for teixeira, and that's strikeout no. 5 for
 chris young tonight. Mark: how was he going to miss that 5 that's a good
 fastball down the middle of the plate. You can get hurt there many times. Not
 that time. Matt: so now hank blalock, 2 for 5 yesterday, and he's singled
 tonight. Use used to imitate tony gwynn as a kid. Hank has said he was never a
 big guy growing up, and he's filled out as a major leaguer, but as a small guy
 that wasn't able to grip it and rip it, he learned how to carve and hit like
 tony gwynn. Into left center, cameron calling off young to make the catch.
 mark: there we got channel 4 fans, matty. Matt: that clearly got the check
 yesterday, that guy. Mark: the akimas that live in texas, family lives in
 oceanside. I got the letter right here, hi from beth marshall, you people out
 in oceanside. What do you think of that, matty 4 matt: think it's great. Here
 is mark derosa now with 2 gone. We've seen a lot of padre fans here in this
 series. Mark: did you get your letters sent your way 2 matt: no. It's okay.
 mark: i didn't think so. 2 chuckles 2 matt: 2 balls and no strikes the count to
 derosa. Matt: into right center, cameron has to move and it gets up and over
 his head, mark derosa rounding into second base. Having a heck of a series,
 here. Inch you know, we've talked about how the ball travels here in right
 center field. If you look at the route for mike cameron, i don't think he
 anticipated that ball going over his head. He thought he had a bead on that,
 and that ball was hit harder than mike thought. You can see mike smiling there
 and shaking his head. Matt: take a look at the swing by mark derosa, and watch
 how soft he is on the front foot. Kept all of his weight back there and those
 are among the adjustments that he has made with rudy jaramillo, the fine
 batting batting batting instructor here. The rangers are proud of what he's
 accomplished. Mark: the hard landing messes everything else on your body,
 matty. Matt: nothing-1 the count to mench. Apparently mark derosa used to dive
 a lot. And he would get caught out his front foot and that would make him
 vulnerable inside and pitchers would find it easy to bust him in, and the
 results are great, hitting 0.345 0 mench slices a fly ball into the right field
 1 -2 mench lines up the middle, and here comes mark derosa with the tying
 strike. -2 cheers and applause -2 matt: a 2 2 out ranger rally evens the score
 at 1 apiece. Mark: looks like mark derosa and mench and their approach the last
 up just shortened up a little bit. This ball is a high, hanging cutter or a
 slider, and you can see you can't take that big hack. He cut back, and both
 guys cut back on their approach. Matt: the inning started out innocently
 enough, hank blalock lined out, mark teixeira lined out, that was 7 in a row,
 then mark derosa's double, mench singles him home and we're back at 1 apiece. 0
 to brad wilkerson. A big swing ask a miss there. Nothing-2. Brad wilkerson will
 out. He leads big league baseball with 84 strikeouts on the year. And he ian
 kinsler ian kinsler the second baseman, next. That was the kind of pitch you
 throw what you want a new baseball, and you call time. Mark: i'm surprised they
 a pitch-outright there. Matt: mench runs, they smelled something but it doesn't
 as brad wilkerson swings and misses, it's strike 3 mark: that's why because
 he's vulnerable to the strikeout. Matt: rangers tie it. Not too close; whatta
 ya' think i got that insurance 3 what insurance is that yogi 3 aflac. 3 duck
 grunts 3 the one ya' really need to have... If you don't have it. That's why
 you need it. Need what 3 aflac. Well, if you get hurt and miss work it won't
 hurt to miss work. Huh 3 and they give ya' cash which is just as good as money.
 ask about it at work. 3 duck grunts 3 matt: your viejas mid game recap, a 1 -1
 draw through 4 , top of the 5 th, and vinny castilla, swinging through
 millwood. Mark: good old-fashioned pitchers' dual, in a ballpark where the ball
 and chris young pitching on the road, and kevin millwood, who is struggling at
 home. Matt: not the case tonight. 1 gone for barfield. There's a knock back up
 the middle. Matt: kevin millwood with 8 -3 , and3-3 with a 6.65 e.r.a. Her home
 for the guy that's in the first year of a year, nearly 6.65 50 milliodeal, iink
 a business disconcerting for the rangers. Mark: absolutely. He was getti 5 and
 a half runs support eac start, and one of his pitches rep line up, aingslider,
 and he learned that from maddux. Matt: e.y.'s jam rolled out to young. Michael
 has really m eric's miserable back here at hounts. 6 -3 , nothing in the

 it. It loo to me like the corner is dark, and it looks like there's not enough
 light out there. He may have lost it there for a second. That's got to bet
 feeling. Matt: michael young now run in. Mark: matty from our vantage point up
 here in the booth, look at how it has a lot of lht there and you the corner
 outfielders, and it's dark. Matt: there looks like a dark spot, especially in
 right. That will get out of 38 38 into the stands. 0 -2 t young. Mark: bad

 for the rangers and for the first time tonight texas 2 -1 take on the marinen
 fridaynight, and everybody beach , tickets are available at padres.com o call
 riars-tix. Mike cameronoff i no. 5 and the first tonight t padres trail xas.
 mike has scored the only san diego run thu far. Mark: this is t of the line up
 the padres if they can get to millwood. 2 hits for giles, 1 f cameron, mike
 scored a run, als as matty oned. Millwoodfastball, gettit up to 94 ow if he
 hits the s spote plate n do e. Main millwood yet to walkatter tonight. Mike
 cameron lines to le that ball was ard but mench i front to make the catch.
 probably overuseded therm "strike when i speak of "we" i speak of us as an
 industry. He is alw ar plate, only 17 in major league baseball, around fewer
 than 1 and a half per start. Giles now with 1 gone. Mark: you love that as a
 manager, of course as a pitching coach, but also your defense. We talk about it
 many times. You want a guy to be around the plate and you want action in the
 infield and in the outfield. Make them earn their way on. Matt: giles grounds
 to shortstop, michael young has it and throws him out. 2 away. Well, in stark
 contrast to the slug fes the padres enjoyed last night, only 1 extra-base hit,
 and this coming on the heels of last night, where we saw them hit 6 extra base
 hits last night. And that has everything to do with kevin millwood. Mark: he's
 gotten grounders, when he really needed it, couple double plays, 2 turned by
 texas tonight. Matt: 0 -1 the count to piazza. Mike is hitless tonight, 0 -2
 swing and a high drive into the opposite field, mark derosa on the move,
 looking up and it's gone -2 -2 cheers and applause -2 solo shot for mike, his 9
 of the year and san diego gets it right back, tied at 2 apiece. That's why the
 big boy is in there. Mark: i love the follow-through of mike piazza when he
 goes to the opposite field. Watch the recoil. Head down, oh, yeah 2 that's some
 nice. 395 395 foot shot for the big boy 395 matt: no. 406 in the hall of fame
 career of piazza, next up on the all-time list, do you come snyder and 40 th
 place, all-time. So now adrian gonzalez, with a 2 0 count. Mark: matty, only
 the 9 th home run given up by millwood this year. Matt: he is still some kind a
 2 -1 the count to adrian, now. 3 -1 to gonzalez. Bellhorn next, 2 2
 outututututututut a pretty good series for mike. 2 runs batted in yesterday,
 one in a home run tonight. He'll be in there tomorrow at the d.h. Spot.
 gonzalez follows with a drive into the opposite field. Gary matthews read it
 well off the bat and runs it down. Rare long ball success against kevin
 millwood, mike piazza goes deep for the 9 th time this year. We're tied at 2
 here for chris young and the padres, after the 108 th spich a quick inning here
 the 6 th, keep it tied so he can be the pitcher of record and hopefully the
 padres the next half of the inning can add on and have that man, the big, 6 -10
 hander get them to victory. Matt: 2 -2 to mark teixeira, 0 -2 tonight. We talk
 about this often, getting in ask out of town while a team's premiere power guy
 is hurting a by the. Mark: oh, my. Matt: he discarded the bat thinking it was 0
 , he'll have a slice oer crack. Matt: we talked about the drop-off between last
 and this for mark teixeira. Batting average is a wash and in the same number of
 after 71 games the real difference comes with power. 20 home runs at this point
 the season last year, and only 6 as we stand today. Matt: 3 -2 dramatic upper
 cut on that swing as he pops it into short right for josh barfield. 1 gone.
 keep 'em quiet. Be sure to tune into a brand new edition of "san diego insider"
 some say miramar is the answer for the airport, but the military says no. Will
 joint use work 1 some surprising answers on the issue on "san diego insider
 magazine." right after the game tonight. Hank blalock with 1 gone now. Talked
 about it earlier, the fact that hank blalock grew up watching tony gwynn and
 his swing. You could fill out a team of current big leaguers who initial
 watching of swings came from watching tony gwynn. Mark: hey, look at that 1
 chris young finishes up in a nice fielding position and makes the snag. Matt:
 look at that. He's an athlete, now. Up to 116 pitches, here, and with 2 gone
 he'll go to work on mark derosa, a guy whose given everybody trouble this
 series, 4 for 6 gotta figure, mud cat that with the pitch count getting to 1200
 chris young will not be back. Mark: yeah, and that's why i was saying. John
 adkins, low carb there in the padre bullpen. Matt: 0 -2 to mark derosa. Mark: i
 he might drop the hammer on him right here. No, high heat. Matt: ball and 2
 strikes. Mench next, in fact, the 5 and 6 spots have been productive for the
 rangers tonight. And the 1 -2 another high fastball fouled back. Young's
 numbers in this ballpark last year were slightly higher than his overall
 numbers. Whether that had anything to do with the fact that the rangers thought
 was expendable or not, we don't know. He had a 4.86 e.r.a. Here last year and
 of his 31 starts 20 of them came in this ballpark. The guy won 12 games and
 twha tied a rookie ranger's record. Mark: i heard that the padres were
 interested in gerald laird, the catcher, but they wanted to hang on to him,
 because he's the future for them in catchers, the next years, and that's when
 chris young's name came up and they jumped on the deal. Matt: 2 -2 mark: pretty
 pitch. Matt: there was your hank bauer pitch right there. That's what we were
 talking about, 12 wins by a rookie pitcher, a share of the franchise record
 with kevin brown and edwin correa. There's ball 4 , he lost mark derosa. Mark:
 i thought he had him with that breaking ball. Matt: here comes darren balsley
 and it's generally, as we know, a conversation when darren balsley comes out
 and a move when we see boch, so this will be how do you feel, do you want one
 more guy 4 mark: looking at the body language of chris young, it really doesn't
 like he's laboring that much, he threw a nice breaking ball, could have been
 easily called strike 3 he did not get the call. He threw a fastball down and
 away. The legs might be getting heavy. It would be tough to get in that
 pointing down position, exactly where he wants the ball. Matt: kevin mench
 walked and singled in a run tonight. Mark: you know, i think this comes down to
 move bruce bochy wants 3 3 he wants to have chris young get the victory. Don't
 you think 3 matt: there goes mark derosa on the first pitch and the shot
 fouled. I would agree, i think that's the motivation for giving the guy the
 chance to finish the inning. Absolutely. Mark: the first pitch fastball, the
 runner was going, but mench can't catch up with it, fouling it out of play.
 matt: at 125 pitches, this is chris young's deepest pitch count of the year.
 and dare i say that 125 125 or didn't chan ho have a start earlier where he
 went 127 , 131 131 mark: he may have. Matt: there's the former ranger. You
 know, both of the deals the padres have worked out with texas have worked out
 pretty good. Mark: sure. Matt: okay for both teams, but real good for san
 diego. Mark: remember adam eaton had that adam eaton surgery. Remember, we
 talked about the surgery with adam himself in front of the dugout the other day
 we were talking about taking the ligament out of one arm and put it go in his
 finger and the hirshiser surgery was the elbow surgery, and i dubbed it the
 adam eaton surgery. Matt: boch did everything he can to let chris young finish
 the 6 th, and then a miss reply a hard hit ball and that's going to be it for
 c.y. He couldn't wait any longer. He had john adkins up p 6 it looks like
 embree is up out of the bullpen. Everything is always on sale at motoworld.
 we'll be back. Matt: still a 2 -2 sdpie chris young finally removed. Boy, as we
 a moment ago, boch did everything he could to let him finish the inning but he
 ends with 7 strikeouts tonight. Mark: he was going up the ladder, and we've
 said since game 1 of this series, they like the high, fastball. Occasionally he
 drop a breaking ball, the second and third time around. That was a breaking
 ball right there. A great effort, good big league outing for the right hander.
 and now they'll go the other side and alan embree will try to end this. Matt:
 he was one of 5 padre relievers to get into the box score last night. He went 2
 an inning. His job is simply to get this man and finish this last of the 6 th.
 rerz go, first pitch taken for a strike. How about that call 6 mark: gutsy,
 yes. You better make sure that you can get those bags. Look at the way the
 defense it playing. It looked like castilla was playing back, they're looking
 for him to pull, the infield is back. Matt: mark derosa with just his second
 stolen base and mefrj in his first attempt of the year. That caught everybody
 by surprise. Mark: and alan embree over looked them at second base, too. Matt:
 jam shot, popped him up, greene read it well off the bat and is there to finish
 inning. Nothing comes, 2 runners left stranded, we played 6 tied at twoo. 2
 matt: friends, log onto padres.com and castilla your votes for the '06 all-star
 and make sure the padres are represented in pittsburgh. You might want to check
 make sure this guy isn't living in your zip code while you're on your computer.
 mess with texas 2 mark bellhorn leads things off in the san diego 7 th.
 bellhorn, greene and castilla, as kevin millwood continues, and kevin millwood
 whose pitch count at 1 point tonight was on line with that of his opposite
 number has really started to work quickly now, second and third time through.
 he had a 6 6 pitch 4 th, a 5 5 pitch 5 th, and even with the home run to piazza
 the 6 th inning, he had a quick 6 up and in to bellhorn, 2 -1 mark: even though
 was only the 77 th pitch by millwood, the last couple of pitches have been up.
 i don't know if it's by design, but i doubt it. A high fastball to bellhorn
 fouled back and then the high, breaking ball. Still has the 2 2 seam running
 fastball down and away to the lefties. Matt: laird sets up way outside, and
 bellhorn fouls it off. Tomorrow, the game 3 pitching match-up, and, again, no
 tv tomorrow in the day game, hensley for san diego, john rheinecker for the
 rangers. Mark: john rheinecker 3 matt: first-year left hander, who is 2 -1 the
 rangers have had trouble with the four and five spots in hir rotation. They
 just put kameron loe on the disabled list yesterday and we're told that tehada
 is going to come up from triple-a oklahoma to fill in that spot next week. 2
 balls, 2 strikes the count to bellhorn. Full count now. Mark: i think the
 padres as we go late in the ball game, we talked about laird behind home plate
 and his success at throwing out runners, the padres are going to have to do
 this via power or trying to get runners across. They can throw the running game
 the window unless you put on a hit and run. Matt: just fouled down the corner
 in right. There's your net right there, mud cat. Mark: there was one down the
 left field line, also. Hello, tex. Matt: there's the coward of the county
 himself, right there. Mark: that's a sweet lid. Matt: and there's ball 4 to
 bellhorn, the lead-off walk issued here in the 7 th. Mark: here is the
 situation i was just talking about matty, with the first baseman, teixeira
 holding on the runner, bellhorn, there is a huge hole to the right side. Matt:
 greenie 0 -2 tonight. He had a single in yesterday's opener. Mark: and also at
 third base, blalock is creeping in. I don't know whether he's anticipating a
 bunt or whatever, but he was up on the grass a little bit ago. Matt: out of the
 the first pitch to khalil, slider, fouled back. There's nobody up throwing in
 the ranger bullpen yet, though a couple of guys are up and standing out there
 and the rangers, like the padres, worked relatively deep into their bullpen
 last night in the opener. Kevin millwood taking considerable time between
 pitches here late. And out of the stretch again, greene swings and sends a
 drive well hit out to right center field, gary matthews on the run and he makes
 will lee mays grab. A fine catch by gary matthews, junior. Mark: i thought this
 had extra bases written all over it. Gary matthews, junior having a heck of a
 year at the plate and you know what -2 nicely done. He almost overran that ball
 looks like, a little by the. That's a huge out. Matt: vinny castilla now with 1
 bellhorn remains at first. Vinny still trying to convert on the five-game
 hitting streak tonight, 3 for 4 opener yesterday, hitless in 2 at-bats tonight.
 tell you what, kevin millwood, he knows exactly the scouting report. First
 pitch slider away. Heness he's hacking early in the count. Matt: come inside
 and he pops it up. That's going to get into the seats. Mark: ball is coming
 back. Matt: not into the seats at all. It's coming back indeed. Wow 2 2 cheers
 and applause 2 matt: never give up on a pop over to that third base side off
 the right hander's side, as hank blalock proves me wrong. Mark: boch almost had
 get out of the way, jim maloney. That ball tuck 18 , 20 different turns in the
 air. Hank blalock squeezes it for the out. Matt: 2 gone now. Up to barfield to
 try to further that lead-off walk. Josh has one of san diego's 6 hits tonight
 on the first pitch he pops into foul territory. Teixeira making the catch.
 millwood tightens up after the lead-off walk. 7 th inning stretch in arlington.
 at 2 matt: come out to the ballpark on saturday for game 2 of the week end
 series with the mariners and get there early for fiesta, con los padres. Mark:
 call 877 877 friar-tix, or padres.com. Matt: john adkins gets the call and is
 on the mound now. Mark: possibly for adkins, somebody out of the bullpen,
 hopefully, and the bottom of the order for john. Matt: ian kinsler leads things
 for texas. It will be kinsler, laird and matthews, for the rangers. 2 runs on 6
 2 errors committed by san diego tonight, and 2 runs, 4 hits, no errors by the
 rangers. This is what we expected coming out to the ballpark tonight. With
 millwood versus young, you didn't look for this to be the offensive night that
 both teams enjoyed last night. Mark: so it seems like the missques are going to
 the story tonight, huh 4 thank goodness the error in the 6 th by vinny castilla
 score any runs, left two runners stranded. Matt: is that joe camel 6 i don't
 think that's family friendly to have a cigarette mascot here. Mark: i'm talking
 you. Good to see you. See you, big boy. Look at the mullet on that guy. Matt: i
 the "t" is for tired. Grounded out to shortstop, khalil makes the play. Doesn't
 look like joe camel 6 mark: it does look like him 6 matt: ian kinsler retired
 for the first out of the inning. 6 chuckles 6 mark: you know, you're right. I'm
 to give tom ceterski a point in the truck, it looks like fabio. Matt: gerald
 laird the batter now, and he grounds to greene. Greenie has not taken any of
 his offensive woes to the field with him this month, though it's been a hot and
 month at the plate, he's been outstanding defense sil. Mark: he knows that his
 glove is valuable, especially at the shortstop position, there's no doubt about
 he's proven it since his first day in the big leagues. That's a serious talent
 right there. Matt: they could put him on that new show with regis. Gary
 matthews, junior with 2 gone and he picks on the first pitch and bounces it
 into right for his first hit of the series. So the 2 2 out single against
 adkins and now john will go to work against michael young, who is 1 -3 tonight.
 know, we talked about the discrepancy in these teams' records in 1 1 run
 decisions last night. The rangers have not faired well in one-run ball games,
 losing one yesterday, and you start to think about that kind of number late in
 a tie game. Rangers are 8 -13 in one-run affairs this year. They've played in a
 of close once, too. Only the oakland a.'s have played in more games decided by
 2 or fewer runs among american league clubs. Speaking of oakland, they're in
 action in denver. A.'s and rockies tied in the 4 th, and the angles defeated
 san francisco, today, and the dodgers and mariners are just getting underway
 now. The white sox putting the hurt on st. Louis again tonight. Mark: they had
 a big night last night. Matt: 12 -4 in the 7 th inning at u.s. Cellular. Mark:
 hawk is having a hey day, huh 7 matt: i gotta believe that cardinal bullpen is
 pretty beat up. Mark: i think adrian gonzalez tried to pull a fast one, he
 caught that ball and acted like the ball got by him. Let's see the acting job
 adrian does. See that 7 matt: gary says, nie try. Big swing and a miss to
 retire the side. Adkins strikes out young, nothing in the ranger 7 th, on to
 the 8 th, still tied 2 apiece. Matt: tune in for forfront and meet a man who
 for more than 3 decades announced padres games and has written about his
 experiences, you see him on the left, bob chandler, long time san diego voice,
 on forfront tomorrow night at 4 :30 and 8 :30, log onto 4 sd.com for more
 information. E.y. Leads off tonight. And he had good numbers against millwood
 and that was part of the decision that bruce bochy made when he decided to
 start young over ben johnson. E.y. Trying to validate that start tonight. Mark:
 could have had a hit earlier in the third inning, but michael young made a heck
 a play, taking a hit away from e.y. Matt: 1 ball, 1 strike to her r to her rick
 michael young has taken away all 3 of eric young's plate appearances tonight.
 millwood rocks and fires the 1 -1 , turns over a slider, 2 balls and a strike.
 check that, 2 -2 to young. And, again, it's michael young, frustrating e.y.
 tonight. So eric young 0 -4 against millwood. And now mike cameron who has had
 a good night, singled, and scored a run. Giles next and then piazza, and this
 may be the last opportunity for the run-producing part of the line up, you
 would like to think they can get somebody going with at least a base runner to
 put millwood out of the stretch. 1 0 to mike cameron. There's some telling
 numbers from the 8 th inning on it has not been good times for kevin millwood.
 there's nobody up behind him right now. Inch i was going to say, in the event
 maybe of an extra-base hit or something, i know buck showalter has a quick
 hook, although millwood has been around a long, long time, he can figure out
 which way millwood is going to go, but i'm surprised nobody is up in that
 bullpen, even though he's only thrown 95 pitches. Good ratio for kevin
 millwood, 2 -1 matt: cameron off the end of the bat, friez into short right
 center field, gary matthews for out no. 2 outside of the piazza home run there
 hasn't been a lot of pop tonight. Mike's home run and giles r.b.i. Double the
 only two extra base hits for san diego, and, again, not so much a criticism to
 the padres as it is to kevin millwood and what he's done tonight. Mark:
 millwood has had good defense behind him. We've mentioned plays the michael
 young made, the khalil greene center field hit by gary matthews, and millwood
 has had two double plays tonight that helped his cause, grounders, on the
 infield, too. Matt: a ball and a strike to giles. You know, one of the weak
 spots, it's been an it's been achilles heal for the rangers, is the bullpen.
 but when the starter stays out there f 8 innings, you don't have a chance to
 get into that. Here is the 1 -2 mark: he had a pitch there, matty. Looked like
 he was up, middle of the plate and kevin millwood may be rubbing up that new
 rock out there thinking, you know, what -2 i just got away with one. Matt: a
 crowd of nearly 30 ,000 strong making their noise in support of their starter,
 2 -2 so giles from behind in the downtown a full count now, 3 -2 , trying to
 keep it alive for piazza who has homered tonight. Mike weights next. 3 -2 home.
 4 and by the narrowest of margins, millwood has walked his second hitter of the
 so now the man response i will for tonight's coors lite cold, hard blast, mike
 piazza who stepped up to the plate in the 6 th with 2 gone. This tied it.
 mike's 9 th of the year. Mark: matty, with that walk he got a beehive working
 in that texas rangers bullpen. They got up in a hurry. Ron mahay, the left
 hander, we saw him last night. And the pitching coach buying time for the the
 lefty so he can get loose. Matt: mike 41 on the list of most career home runs,
 and if he keeps it going in 2007 , he will settle somewhere in the high 30 's
 on the all-time home run list this year. One of mike's 9 has come to win a ball
 remember the dramatic 9 th inning home run at wrigley field in april 9 piazza
 takes a strike here. Good breaking ball to catch the corner to put mike in the
 hole, 0 -2 mark: that was a dandy. Great, pinpoint control on the last 2
 breaking balls. Stay out of the hot zone of piazza. That's a perfect pitch. Man
 you know, for throwing 104 pitches, that being the 105 th, that's pretty darn
 good. Matt: fastball that was too far inside for millwood to get hurt on. Mark:
 matt: good 0 -2 pitch. 36 times in mike piazza's career he has come up with a
 multiple home run game. Most recently, last september as a met in washington.
 speaking of the mets, they blew a lead at home tonight. Billy wagner blew a
 save as cincinnati came from behind to beat them. There goes giles and the
 throw down to second is not in time 36 the snaek attack stolen base by giles,
 his 5 th of the year, he's in scoring position now on 1 -2 to piazza. Mark: we
 mentioned that laird behind home plate has thrown out 60 60 , just in time he
 gets under the tag. Matt: slider misses outside to make it 2 -2 now, piazza
 doing a good job of recognizing and laying off. Adrian gonzalez next. 2 -2 is
 hit on the fwround to shortstop, young is there. To the bottom of the 8 th,
 tied, 2 apiece. Matt: sunday at petco park is kids day, 14 and younger receive
 a give away item of the decade, mud cat. Mark: what's that 14 matt: the padres
 mr. Potato head padre. Look that. The arm, the eyes, think of the fun. Mark:
 that's nice. Matt: tickets are available at padres.com or 877 877 friar-tix.
 that is a valid mr. Potato head, too, not a knock-off. Scott gets a first pitch
 tonight, and he makes his 33 his 33 rd inning. Year. A new catcher, he is
 working, too, as bowen has taken over hien the plate. Matt: here is hank
 blalock, now. 1 away, bases empty, 2 -2 tie, last of the 8 th. Good one
 tonight. Hank blalock sends a drive into center, this will stay playable for
 mike cameron. 2 quick outs for scott linebrink who is part of what is
 statistically the best pull been in major league baseball in terms of e.r.a.,
 3.23 , the lowest in the game. Mark: can you say rolaids relief bullpen award
 3.23 starters love that but it's a great feeling when you leave a ball game and
 have 6 , 7 solid innings and you have guys like adkins, cassidy, linebrink
 coming in. Hopefully they can bridge that gap to trevor hoffman, as a former
 friar starts to heat up for the rangers, akinori otsuka. Matt: aki, our guy.
 mark derosa stole a base tonight, second of the year, and you talked about it
 yesterday that what aki comes in in a save situation in arlington, they play
 "hells bells" over the stadium intercom system, and aki about a respectful guy
 that you would ever want to meet, and before they did that, he asked trevor if
 it was okay. Mark: that's aki. Matt: base hit back up the hilgdz. Middle. Matt:
 2 out single, so mark derosa is aboard and now mench. Mark: both pitching
 staffs this evening, kevin millwood has gone the whole way so far, but 6 hits
 surrendered by both clubs, and mark derosa is the only guy in the line up that
 has 2 hits. Matt: here is mench, now. Again, the 5 and 6 holes have been the
 problem spots tonight. Mench has a hit and an r.b.i. Here is a question for you
 cat. Mark: okay. Matt: what does kevin mench have in common with our good
 friend gordon shaw from the cleaners 6 mark: um matt: i'll give you a hint,
 it's not hat size. Kevin mench wears an 8 that has earned him the nickname
 shrek. They're both delaware guys. Mark: oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.
 matt: our guy, gordon 8 mark: that's right. Not too many guys in the big
 leagues from delaware. Matt: it's a pretty short list. I mean, active big
 leaguers, you know, you got mench, deshields, long since retired. Mark: what's
 their ckname 8 matt: small state your full name and spell it for the record
 mark: the fighting peacocks 8 matt: and when those clothes get dirty, look
 out... This is a big dome. What size do you wear 8 mark: 7 3 matt: what does
 boch wear 3 mark: 8 plus. Matt: and that's what mench wears. Brad wilkerson on
 deck as linebrink is careful not to ignore mark derosa at first. A 2 -2 tie and
 is where eave been since the piazza home run in the top of the 6 th. Mark: did
 you mention the stolen bases mark derosa has this year 6 matt: i did. Mention
 it again for the people. Mark: it's only one, folks, but something could be on,
 2 , i take that back, 1 tonight. Matt: it's 3 -1 on mench, now. Brad wilkerson
 is due up and he'll be linebrink's hitter. Embree has been used for one hitter
 tonight. Mark: the pace of this game has slowed down, huh -1 matt: yeah, it
 has. And that will fill the count, 3 -2 always thought kevin mench with hair
 would like like kevin milar. Runner goes on 3 -2 and mench fouls it away. He's
 another ranger hitter that does not get cheated. Forget about shortening up the
 -2 pitch. -2 chuckles -2 mark: mench looks like dynamo from running man. Matt:
 that's a good call. Obscure but good. Runner goes again a swing and a miss, and
 sets the rangers down without, in the 8 th. On to the 9 th. Tied two apiece.
 matt: visit padres.com, for the official baseball news, padres on a mission. 0
 unusual because when trevor sanctioned "hells bells" for aki, i guess he didn't
 he would be entering to that. Mark: i was surprised at that, also. Matt: as
 fans know, aki did not begin the season as the closer. After shuffling people
 around, they've settled in on akinori otsuka at the back of the bullpen. It's
 again a good decision. As mud mentioned, he's converted in 13 of his 15
 opportunities this year. Gonzalez gets to it with a lead-off in the 9 th.
 there's your potential go-ahead run to lead off inning no. 9 going to have a
 pinch-runner as adrian is lifted for ben johnson. With a d.h. In play, there
 are a lot of things that can happen. There aren't constraints as far as where
 guys can play. Mark: right, and the guys remaining on the bench now for san
 diego, you can scratch bowen off, but blum and bard, bard had that foul tip off
 left foot last night. Matt: nothing-1 the count to bellhorn, who has singled
 and walked. Mark: you make a good point, matty, regarding the american league.
 every one talked e.y. About playing in the american league. He said collecting
 a lot of rust, not a lot of a.b. Aechlts matt: you don't find guys anxious to
 go to american league teams as f-troopers. You're not going to get a lot of
 at-bats, comparatively speaking, that is. Ask geoff blum about that. Mark:
 blummer told us this spring, the world series, before the dramatic home run he
 said, you know what 9 i've seen one fastball in three weeks. Matt: that was his
 9 it was game three of the world series, extra innings, the pinch-hit home run.
 4 , rather. No, it was game 3 at any rate, pretty sure it was game 3 what did
 blumme tell us 3 that was his first at-bat in, what 3 3 mark: 3 weeks. Matt:
 was it 3 weeks 3 mark: yeah. Matt: 2 balls and 1 strike the count to mark
 bellhorn. Dare i say there is no line up in baseball more familiar with aki
 than that of the san diego padres. A whole different experience with people
 behind him, however, and bellhorn swings ask sends a high drive to right. Mark
 derosa has the play off the bat and it looked like that was going to get out
 farther, 1 gone. Matt: have you ever purchased a car from mossy nissan, the way
 buy includes upfront information, use of the iq computers, compares the price
 of a vehicle at mossy to vehicle prices at other dealer ships, six locations in
 diego county, national city, say high to tim howell, mossy nissan. Here is
 khalil greene with 1 out shs 1 on. Castilla next, should it go farther.
 anything short of a double play ball and vinny will have an at-bat, here. You
 know, aki kept his house in san diego. It was with a rather heavy heart that he
 dealt to the rangers in the off-season. He still loves it in san diego. In
 fact, he and his family make that their year-round home still. Kids are out of
 school, we understand, and heading to arlington this week. Mark: uh-huh. It was
 that aki blue a save and he got on the horn and talked to trevor and he said,
 help me try to deal with this. He said the thing is to keep up your confidence
 and turn the page matt: greene lines to left center, johnson to second, and
 daying has something brewing here late against an old teammate. Mark: we've
 seen the opposition pitching against khalil greene lately. He's having with the
 ball down and away. In the short time merv rettenmund has been here, he's been
 working with khalil greene. He didn't hang that, it was a good pitch, he stayed
 it nicely and hit it to left center. Matt: the second time tonight that san
 diego has put together more than one hit in an inning. Now it's up to vinny,
 looking to convert on the 5 5 game hitting streak tonight. 0 -3 thus far. That
 one bounces away from laird, throw gets away from hank blalock. Here comes
 johnson and san diego takes a leave-2 lead. Greene to third. Did that remind
 you of friday at anaheim -3 mark: good call. Matt: wow -3 same point of the
 night, top of the 9 th. Mike tried to get a runner in anaheim, and 9 9 boy.
 this time it was laird who tried to make an all-star caliber play, that was
 going to be awfully close at third. Mark: it looked like a catchable ball for
 blalock at third, also. Matt: so the infield in now forecast, swing and a miss,
 he goes behind, or rather one ball, one strike to vinny, now. Irony of ironies,
 run scores against aki and now trevor is up for the bottom of the 9 th. Mark:
 well, we heard bells. Doesn't necessarily mean that he has to follow those
 bells, right 9 matt: 1 -2 to castilla. Swing and a miss. That's one of the four
 five ak sliders that's in the toolbox. So 2 fwaun and now josh barfield, a
 costly throwing error hung on gerald laird here as he tried to get the pinch
 runner at third that bounce ad way from him. Mark: it would be nice to get a
 little esurance, here, how about a 2 2 out knock 2 matt: josh takes a strike.
 you know, it's one thing when the angles, lose a game, with a play like the one
 happened on friday. It's another thing when it happens here. The rangers are a
 much better defensive team. Aki has josh barfield 0 -2 slider fouled away.
 mark: the last game that we played in anaheim, the angles had 56 errors. Now
 the rangers are 42 , compared to the 56 angel errors. Matt: an unrender run,
 trevor time for the second straight night. Matt: for the second straight night
 in the series, trevor time on the road. Tonight trevor looks for save no. 18 ,
 and, again, it's a 1 1 run lead that he's called onto protect here in
 arlington. Mark: last night in the 9 th it was 1 , 2 , 3 due up for the
 rangers, tonight the bottom third. It is going to be brad wilkerson, ian
 kinsler and gerald laird, due up for the rangers. Matt: this is how the padres
 reorient defensively. It will be blum taking over for gonzalez at first and the
 that ran, ben johnson, takes over for young in left. Here we go. As mud
 mentioned, bottom third of the order for texas. Can trevor continue to 3 3
 continue to make a 1 1 run decision a difficult thing for buck showalter to
 pallet 1 here is wilkerson, a swing and a miss at a fastball, 0 -1 trevor
 making his 4 th career appearance here in this yard. Mark: even though that was
 pitch swinging, he looked like he didn't know what to expect from trevor. There
 wasn't the good, full, first-pitch rip. Matt: just missing the corners, here, 2
 brad wilkerson has more experience against trevor hoffman than anybody on this
 rangers roster by virtue of his days in the national league, 0 -5 with 3
 strikeouts. 3 -1 now. Ian kinsler next and then laird. Fastball right doin the
 middle taken to fill the count, 3 -2 mark: that's that pitch trevor can throw 8
 of 10 times behind in the count, when needed. It's that 4 4 seamer, hit the
 glove, you bet. Matt: full count. Bowen wants is on the corner and he stays
 alive. Oakland and colorado tied 1 apiece, the giants have lost, the damager
 damage dodgers have a 1 1 nothing lead on the mariners in the third. And they
 can pick up a full game in the division tonight if they can pull this one out.
 mark: how did that miss 1 that pitch is not low. Matt: bill welkie was the
 first base umpire last night and called the ball foul off the bat of mark
 teixeira last night. Ian kinsler is 0 -3 tonight, reached on an error and
 scored in the 5 th. Mark: almost 100 at-bats for ian kinsler, he has yet to
 ground into a double play. Matt: i like where you were going with that, put the
 on him. Mark: believe it. Matt: ball and no strikes. Mark: once against, ian
 kinsler has yet to ground into a double play this year. Matt: got a
 pinch-runner at first base, freddy guzman, the former padre, called up from
 triple-a oklahoma city yesterday to replace kameron loe on the roster. If you
 missed his padre career you picked up change between the sofa cushions, though
 at one point considered a top perfect. Greene to barfield, back to blum, what
 was that you said earlier 100 mark: he has yet to ground into a double play
 until now in the ninth. Matt: believe it. 2 gone in the 9 th. Mark: see greenie
 rid of that hot potato 9 that's mashed garlic right there. Matt: not a bad pick
 blummer, either 9 mark: no. Matt: that puts 9 100 into the coffers by jack in
 the box for big brothers and big sisters sisters. 1 -1 the count. The trevor
 hoffman family can make their plans for pittsburgh. Mark: good call. I think
 even the men of the square table would agree with that. Matt: popped him up and
 should do it. Almost 30 ,000 with a collective moan, the type heard out of the
 americas arena last night when the ma mavs choked. How about the padre bullpen,
 for 3 and a third of scoreless relief, finished, as always by trevor hoffman,
 this program and this award approved by the men of the square table, good call.
 4 -1 on the road trip. Win for a consecutive night tonight. Beer back. Mark:
 time for the plays of the game, matty, and they're brought to you by murray
 lampert instruction. Making your remodel seamless. That's the goal. 100 100
 satisfaction since 1975 what do you have for me 1975 matt: giles starting the
 offense tonight and san diego had a 1 1 nothing lead as mike cameron came
 around. That would hold until the bottom of the 4 th when mench singled to
 score mark derosa, at 1 -1 tie took us to the top of the 5 th, or the last of
 the 5 th, rather, when gary matthews, junior, delivered a sacrifice fly that
 gave the rangers a 2 -1 lead. The padres tied it on a piazza blast in the 6 th,
 they would win it with a run in the 9 th. Aki's slider was too much for laird
 to handle and as he tried to cut down ben johnson he threw the ball away, and
 johnson scored what would be the winning run and san diego has taken their
 second straight 1 1 run decision in arlington, 3 -2 friars the final score.
 we're back after this. Matt: final game summary brought to you by the staying
 county ford dealers. See them today. The padres have won threeing in a row,
 it's a 4 -1 trip through the a.l. West. Tonight's victory is for linebrink,
 with a save by trevor. Piazza hit no. 406 , not to be lost was chris young's
 effort, 7 strikeouts pitching into the 6 th inning and, mud cat, there is
 plenty of sunshining on this dog's rear end right now. Mark: this game boiled
 down to a missque, and kevin millwood tried to keep the rangers in this ball
 game and it was a bad throw to third base that was the difference. Matt: friars
 to bed 38 -33 with at least a 1 1 game least in the national league west
 pending what happens with the dodgers, and mariners tonight. We'll next join
 you on friday. "outta left field" starts at 6 and game "prime time padres" 6
 :30. And then we'll start the game. Mark: don't mess with the friars. Matt:
 final score, san diego wins, 3 -2 padres. Executive producer is channel 4 is
 chris nichols, tonight's game produced by tom ceterski, associate producer,
 "chyron bob" wehrsdorfer, thanks to our texas crew, good to work with you. For
 mark grant, this is matt vasgersian, and we'll see you friday from petco park.

 endurance test of pain, there's someone here today to tell you that those days
 are over because there is a safe, gentle solution to arthritis pain, joint
 pain, muscle aches, soreness and stiffness. >> here to tell us all about it is
 renown medical specialist, author and noted expert in the fields of joint pain
 and arthritis, dr. Garry gordon. Welcome, dr. Gordon. >> thank you. It's my
 pleasure to be here with you on iceland health forum. >> now, dr. Gordon, what
 causes joint pain and stiffness 0 >> the major cause is inflammation in the
 joints and inflammation in the muscles. Inflammation is the main reason you
 ache when you move about or even do everyday tasks. >> so what do people do to
 relieve the inflammation 0 >> unfortunately, many people are taking
 prescription pain relievers, but these are very harsh anti-inflammatory
 medicines. They are extremely hard on the body, and the heart in particular.
 while they may reduce the inflammation, they are also liable to cause a number
 of other problems including heart attack. >> so the cure can be worse than the
 disease 0 >> absolutely. >> so what are we supposed to do 0 >> some people
 think that they are just destined to live with pain, and there's nothing they
 can do about it. I'm here to tell them that true relief is finally available
 and it's safe, gentle and worry-free. It's iceland health joint relief formula.
 0 0 0 >> upon waking in the morning, i had to sit on the edge of the bed for
 five to 10 minutes before standing up... Uh, so i'm much more flexible and it's
 um, much more enjoyable waking up, facing life now. >> well, i feel more
 flexible, and i feel like... 10 exhales 10 my body doesn't ache. >> iceland
 health joint relief formula certainly helps them, but what exactly does it do,
 dr. Gordon 10 >> iceland health joint relief formula is made by the same people
 bring you the world's best-selling brand of omega-3: iceland health. They've
 taken their pharmaceutical grade omega-3 and after long and extensive research,
 developed a proprietary formula that contains other powerful natural
 ingredients that are known to reduce inflammation, increase joint lubrication
 and flexibility and build cartilage. >> what does iceland health joint relief
 formula contain 10 >> first, joint relief formula contains omega-3. It is made
 from deep-water fish caught in the cold, clear waters around iceland. This
 means they aren't tainted with unhealthy levels of dioxin, pcbs, pesticides and
 if the fish are healthier, that naturally means the omega-3 has to be better.
 and joint relief formula is made with omega-3 that is the best in terms of
 purity. In joint relief formula, iceland health has combined their omega-3 with
 ii. This is what makes up moveable joints and provides a high level of
 chondroitin sulfate, an anti-inflammatory that improves the quality of joint
 tissue. It also contains hyaluronic acid, which is the major component in joint
 fluid that cushions joints. Thanks to the collagen 2 , the enzymes that destroy
 protein in the cartilage face major resistance. It also lessens inflammation
 and promotes new cartilage synthesis. In addition, joint relief formula
 contains glucosamine which prevents cartilage destruction, swelling and loss of
 >> so how do all of these ingredients work 2 >> that's the best part of it.
 let's look at this scale model of a knee joint. The omega-3 reduces
 inflammation in the joints right in here. Study after study has shown omega-3
 to be one of nature's most powerful anti-inflammatories. The collagen 2 then
 serves as building block for your moveable joints. Its chondroitin... Gives
 your joints elasticity and it enhances the manufacture of hyaluronic acid,
 which is the main ingredient in joint lubrication fluid. On top of all these
 relievers and protectors is glucosamine, which is a guardian of cartilage.
 together, this natural matrix of pain relief reduces inflammation that causes
 pain and provides multi-dimensional support for joint connective tissue to
 prevent further pain. So in essence, joint relief formula is repairing and
 replenishing. >> and i don't need a prescription for iceland health joint
 relief formula 2 >> not at all, joint relief formula is completely natural and
 gentle, yet remarkably effective on joint pain and muscle pain as well. In
 fact, over time, iceland health joint relief formula will naturally help you
 feel less and less pain because the causes of the pain are being eliminated. >>
 joint relief formula is safer than vioxx, bextra, celebrex, aleve and those
 types of prescription pain relievers 2 >> iceland health joint relief formula
 is totally safe. Not only are you relieving the pain, you're also relieving
 your anxieties about pain relievers. And here's something else everyone should
 know: omega-3 in joint relief formula is not just reducing inflammation but
 also removing arterial plaque and improving your circulation. So it's
 protecting your heart while it's relieving pain. >> so in iceland health joint
 relief formula, you have omega-3 which reduces inflammation and is good for
 your heart. There's collagen ii which contains chondroitin and hyaluronic acid,
 of which are natural substances that improve the condition of your joints, and
 glucosamine, which prevents cartilage destruction, swelling and loss of
 flexibility. >> very good. >> doctor, um, how about sports injuries-- things
 like muscle aches and, um, aching joints 2 >> ginger needs, uh, something for
 her tennis elbow. >> well, ginger, look at it this way-- if iceland health
 joint relief formula can be effective on severe joint pain, just imagine how
 well it can work on everyday muscle aches as well as the soreness you feel
 after working out, or in your case, playing a hard game of tennis. >> but will
 it improve my backhand 2 >> ginger, try this. The only thing you have to lose
 is your pain. >> i had the beginnings of arthritis in my right hand. I could
 barely put my makeup on... Or write. I was even having trouble typing on the
 computer. The arthritis has disappeared inside of three months. >> i'd done
 some damage to the joint in my thumb and i was getting to where i couldn't,
 literally couldn't pick up things. I mean, the pain, but just the strength
 wasn't there because whatever i've done, and i hadn't had a chance to see a
 doctor about it. Since i've taken iceland health, i, uh, have seen the strength
 back. It seems to be literally as strong as the other one now. >> my workouts
 are pretty intense. There's always a lot of tears in the body base in the
 different movements, especially when you do martial arts. I noticed a
 tremendous change in, in the way my body feels. My body feels great. It's just
 like putting oil in a car. >> since taking the iceland health product, i have
 felt more invigorated. I have had a better sense of wellness, i've been

 grade. Plus, all harmful materials that might be present such as mercury, pcbs
 and other toxins are completely removed. >> so not only is iceland health joint
 formula far safer than prescription pain relievers, it also contains pure
 omega-3 90 >> correct... If you're taking the purest omega-3 you can find, then
 helps increase the effectiveness in reducing inflammation that causes joint
 pain. >> well, it makes sense to me, but is there any proof that omega-3
 actually reduces inflammation and relieves pain 90 >> let me give you just a
 few examples among the hundreds of studies that have been done. Renowned
 institutions have all reported that omega-3 is a safe way to reduce joint pain,
 reduce risk of coronary heart disease and blood clotting, promote healthy heart
 and slow hardening of the arteries. By reducing inflammation, cholesterol is
 lowered, circulation improves and heart attacks are prevented. In joint relief
 formula, iceland health has combined their omega-3 with collagen ii. This is
 what makes up moveable joints and provides a high level of chondroitin sulfate,
 anti-inflammatory that improves the quality of joint tissue. It also contains
 hyaluronic acid which is the major component in joint lubrication fluid that
 cushions joints. Thanks to the collagen ii, the enzymes that destroy the
 protein in cartilage face major resistance. It also lessens inflammation and
 promotes new cartilage synthesis. In addition, joint relief formula contains
 glucosamine, which prevents cartilage destruction, swelling and loss of
 flexibility. >> the pain has definitely subsided. >> i have felt more
 invigorated, i have had a better sense of wellness. I've been happier. I've
 been exercising more, which makes me feel happier. >> and over time, iceland
 health joint relief formula will naturally help you feel less and less pain
 because the causes of the pain are being eliminated. >> that's remarkable. >>

 available in the united states until now. >> if you want to find out about how
 to get this remarkable pain relief beyond prescription, watch this. >> i like
 the fact that it's coming from iceland. I feel that it's probably a place that
 has very little pollution, um, the fact that the product is a pharmaceutical
 grade. >> my husband was getting arthritis in his left foot, which was a great
 problem because he's a long-distance biker. It was also a great problem because
 was a source of embarrassment for me because if we were to go out to dinner, he
 only wear a slipper. He wanted to wear flip flops on his left foot. And i...
 have noticed that since he's been taking omega-3, he has started wearing his
 sneakers again, with laces, and when we went out to dinner the other night, he
 was able to wear a hard leather shoe with a buckle. Also, his arthritis, the
 great pain that he had in his left foot has just about disappeared, and he
 is... Winning races for long-distance biking. It's true. >> i've been taking it
 six months, and honestly, most of my pains are gone. >> i've definitely noticed
 difference. My knee, um, i have less pain in my knee and i'm able to dance a

 0 0 0 we wanted to introduce red to the toughest group we could think of... A
 group of firefighters. These guys know all about using equipment to get a job
 done. At first, they were skeptical... >> there is nothing more boring in the
 world than working out. >> real test is to get it past us. We tend to be hard
 on stuff. >> announcer: 0 0 0 until they tried it. >> feels good. >> it's
 pretty solid. >> it's really smooth. It moves very easily. It's pretty cool. 0
 chuckles 0 >> i weigh 250 pounds. This is supporting me just fine. >> once you
 get going, you can start feeling it. On the sides, definitely. >> hoo, there it
 250 >> yeah, you can feel it burning right here. >> well, i'm feeling it in my
 lower abs, and i'm also feeling it in my obliques. 250 gear cranks 250 >> the
 core and all the way in to the back, you can feel it. The more you do it, you
 start feeling the burn. It feels good. >> see, i can, i can feel it here but i
 can also feel it a little more in my hips, too. It'll be a good workout. >> you
 get a good workout out of this. >> it's a nice, low-impact workout. I can
 borrow it for about six weeks, see how... 250 laughter 250 >> it is quick, you
 know, and it does do all the things that they're saying. >> man: seems like
 you're on to something, man. 250 0 0 0 0 >> top fitness trainers have known
 about the core sculpting power of rotational exercises for years, but it's been
 to do until now. >> announcer: so what do fitness professionals think of red 0
 we took it to some of america's finest trainers and exercise physiologists and
 asked for their opinions. >> i love red. It's done a lot for my back and neck,
 and it's helped my core strength tremendously. The results i've seen... Uh,
 with the people that have used red have been truly amazing. It's the best
 abdominal exerciser i have ever used. >> so with red, you're getting all areas
 of the abs. You're getting the obliques, you're getting the upper ab, you get
 the lower ab, you're getting the whole central abdominal muscles, not just
 strictly isolating one small section like the old-fashioned ab crunchers where
 you're just coming straight forward and back down. So you basically get a full
 abdominal workout, hitting all areas of your ab muscles with red. >> well,
 we're raising our heart rate, we're helping to circulate and stimulate the
 blood flow. I think red would work for just about anyone. >> red is great for
 the lower abs, especially for women. Um, a lot of clients that i have who've
 had babies, this is great. It really gets deep in there, works the core muscles
 the lower part of the abs. Red is easy. You'll get your results. >> i can
 definitely feel it in my abdominals, and i can also feel it in my arms. I work
 out all the time and i can feel this more than anything. Does it work 0
 absolutely. >> the keys to rapid results are a full range of motion and using
 resistance training. Red involves all of your core abdominal muscles to get
 that rich range of motion that delivers results. As you rotate on red, your abs
 core muscles are being activated-- from the hips and back to obliques to center
 to obliques and then your back. That's 360 degrees of core abdominal toning
 that's whittling down your waistline. >> gary: and when resistance is added to
 the formula, the results are unbelievable. >> before i started red, i was
 flabby and nasty. 360 laughs 360 i would wear bulky clothes. After using red
 and losing the inches and the weight, i wear clothes that, you know, fit me,
 that show off my body and it got my waist down six inches. It's incredible. >>
 my stomach was huge. It was huge. It was, uh, just kind of disgusting. When i
 use red fitness, i, i can just feel it right... I can feel it and i know it's
 working. These results from using red fitness were great. >> why haven't
 exercise machines kept up with the times in terms of comfort 360 our car seats,
 home and office furniture-- everything today is built to be comfortable except
 fitness machines. >> let's face it: a lot of exercise equipment isn't easy for
 bigger people to use. But red's padded memory foam seat cushion is extra wide
 and it's soft and comfy. When the exercise is easy on your body, you can
 concentrate on working out without distraction and without discomfort. >>
 announcer: so what do regular people think about red 360 well, we took it to
 laguna beach, california to find out. >> this is cushiony, does not hurt your
 butt like sitting on a wood floor. >> you got a lot of "cush"... A cush for the
 360 laughs 360 >> you could sit here and watch tv while you do it. 360 laughs
 360 >> wow, this feels great. I feel like it's working all of the right
 muscles. >> i'm feeling it here... And down lower, too. >> i'm starting to feel
 burn. >> i'm feeling this burn here pretty fast doing this. >> man: yeah, it's
 working, i can feel it. >> you can feel 'em flexing and tightening right here
 in the front and then on the sides. >> i feel in my lower stomach. >> i feel it
 my stomach. >> my stomach, right here. >> right here. >> right here. >> here.
 >> right here. >> right around, right around here. On the sides down here. >> i
 definitely feel how it isolates the muscles. >> that lower, very lower ab. >> i
 like it. It's good. >> it's very good. >> it's easy to do, it's comfortable. I
 like it, it just feels good. >> you feel it all the way around your waist, you
 feel it down the front. 'cause you can tell i'm breathing. 360 laughs 360 it's
 a good workout. >> i feel like this is going to get my six pack back. >> red's
 easy on your body and it's also easy to use. Your back remains straight and
 relaxed because the vertebrae in your back are in the ideal, relaxed neutral
 position. You grab hold of the handles which adjust to match your arm length,
 and now you just rotate right and left and right and left. At different points
 in your rotation, different abs and core muscles are recruited, so by doing one
 rep, you tone and strengthen all your core muscles. You've toned your waistline
 the way around for that 360 360 degree toning. The key is you don't have to
 bend your back over to work the abs. You simply twist your torso to one side
 and then the other. Compare this to the crunches on one of those exercise
 balls. Those are so hard to use and to balance on. Even small, short twists
 like this are firing off ab muscles across the core and here in the center of
 the abs and across the abdomen. >> gary: make red your favorite color, like
 these women who take body slimming very seriously. 360 classical music
 playing... 360 >> many of the movements in dance do deal with circular
 movement. Our dancers have to have the same movement that red has so that the
 body can move forward, side, back and side. It elongates all the muscles around
 waistline and in the upper back and the, and the shoulders. >> i dance and work
 four to five times a week. Red is a very effective machine. I can feel it in my
 i can feel it in my core and the resistance that it takes is absolutely no
 effort on my spine or my neck. I think the results you would get with this
 machine would certainly be beneficial to a dancer because you're stretching and
 resistance at the same time that you're building strength and endurance. With
 red, this is very comfortable to do. I can put this in my den while my kids are
 and watch shows with them and do this workout. Red is deceiving 'cause if you
 just look at it, it looks like a stool. I... When i saw it, i said, "well,
 where is the machine 360 " and they said, "it's right there." and i said,
 "where 360 " and they said, "right there, that red... The red is the machine."
 and i said, "well, how does it work 360 " it and you go side to side," and it
 just didn't look like it would be difficult and it is not difficult, although
 it's effective. I can totally feel it. I do like red. I'm very excited about
 red, i think it's a great machine. I think that it's so small and it's easy to
 fit in your home. It won't take up room. I think... Mostly, i think the results
 i'm going to see are gonna be fantastic. >> most people stop using exercise
 equipment because they find working out uncomfortable. They get discouraged and
 but with red, we guarantee that it's the most comfortable workout that you may
 ever experience. There's no impact on the joints, and best of all, red's smooth
 works out your core abdominals thoroughly. You could be burning hundreds of
 calories and slimming down your midsection while watching your favorite tv
 show, and you won't have to crank up the sound because red is virtually silent,
 like those noisy treadmills and cardio bikes. Red is the comfortable way to
 slim down, and talking about slim, red does not take up an entire room like
 other bulky exercise equipment. Use it in the privacy of your bedroom or in the
 and when you're done, red stores under your bed in seconds. Red is that
 once-in-a-lifetime exercise machine that's comfortable and easy to use. It's a
 serious workout that's easy on your body. Red gets results. >> i lost seven and
 half inches off my waist in eight weeks. That's almost an inch a week. These
 are my old pants. And... They're huge 360 i used to... I fit in these eight
 weeks ago. This means more than a scale will ever mean, when you can grab your
 pants... And do that, and know that... They're huge. You can't wear them
 anymore. These are pretty dramatic results. The best part of this is when
 people notice. They say, "you've lost weight 360 " and that's so exciting to
 hear people say. >> i lost five and a half inches off my hips, nine inches off
 my waist, all that using red. And all that within two months. Nine inches
 around my waist is a huge accomplishment for me because before, it just, like,
 stayed there... I'll lose the weight, bigger on the waist. But now with red,
 that's gone. These pants used to fit fairly well. They were nice and
 comfortable. It looks like a clown outfit. Now, i can't even wear these
 anymore. I mean, it's huge... I mean, to the point where if i don't wear a
 belt, they pretty much, like, fall down to my ankle. And all this because of
 red. I'm ecstatic about it, actually. >> write down this phone number and call
 right now and put an exciting new spin on your abs workout with red. It's hot,

 low squatting position. And once you're ready and you've got the strength, we
 can move on to those advanced layers where we go a little bit deeper into the
 legs, really engage the obliques. You can see those abs working. The inner
 thigh, the outer thigh, the glutes. It's a total body exercise. You will get
 rid of your love handles once and for all. It's so exciting to see that sparkle
 people's eyes when they go, "i'm in the best shape of my life." >> for the

 you can see my abdominals. But in addition to that, my waist is smaller. My
 hips are smaller. My arms look better, they're more shapely. I'm just much
 leaner overall. Turbo jam works. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

 and left a message on my answering machine this week. And she said, "this is a
 silly message, but my pants are falling down. And i'm so happy. And i'm sorry
 to bother you, but i'm so excited that my pants are falling down today." and so
 me to, you know, to give that joy to a friend, you know, to a close friend who
 had never tried my workout before, and to see that it could give her that same
 joy was--was really rewarding. >> 30 years i waited to wear a bikini. Turbo jam

 following program is a paid advertisement for alcis, the science of relief. Are
 missing out on the simple pleasures in life 0 are you unable to live an active,
 lifestyle because your joints are sore and hurt 0 do you feel you're just not
 living each day with passion and vigor because you're not feeling your best 0
 you are about to discover a noninvasive, nonprescription, doctor-recommended
 medical breakthrough that could literally change how you manage your pain and
 allow you to live the life you've always wanted. If your life is held back by
 arthritis, if you are inhibited from living your life fully because of back
 pain, shoulder pain, if you suffer from fibromyalgia or any other chronic pain,
 need to stay tuned. If you've just pulled a muscle and want immediate relief,
 you need to stay tuned. If you feel like you are being held back, even if it's
 just a little bit, from living your life fully because you are in pain, or if
 you feel like you are unable to do all the things you used to do because of the
 pains and stiffness we often associate with getting older, you need to stay
 tuned. If you are concerned about the toxic side effects of oral medications
 and don't want to rely on taking potentially toxic pills, don't go away,
 because you are about to discover a patented solution that is so
 technologically advanced and revolutionary that doctors, pain specialists,
 rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons all over the country are now
 recommending it to their patients without a prescription. It's called alcis,
 and it is the true science of pain relief. Alcis is quickly becoming the
 preferred pain solution for pain specialists and medical doctors everywhere.
 with alcis, people are able to be more active and live the lives they want,
 pain-free and fulfilled. No matter what your activities-- walking, biking,
 golf, gardening or just working around the house-- alcis can allow you to enjoy
 activities to the fullest. You've seen it in magazines like arthritis today,
 fibromyalgia aware, u.s. News 0 world report and us weekly. >> if i am in pain,
 a pain to be with. >> that kind of, you know, constant, never-ending, grinding
 pain. >> and it kind of shoots up and down the right side of my back. >> my
 back, my neck and my legs. >> my hands and my neck and my lower back. >> i'm
 not fun to be around when i'm in pain-- i get a little irritable. >> that's why
 is so good, because it stops it now. >> it's an amazing product that works. >>
 it's given me back my attitude. >> i'm happier, because i'm not hurting as
 much. >> hello... Let's talk about pain. How did you feel when you woke up this
 0 do you hurt anywhere right now 0 your back 0 your hands 0 your knees 0 is
 pain affecting the way you live your life 0 the truth is, most of us have some
 kind of ache or pain every single day... Strains and bruises from injuries,
 aching muscles from... Just living. Or what about joint pain from arthritis 0
 well, today you're going to find out how to end your pain, starting with a
 simple phone call. I'm very excited to introduce you to alcis daily relief.
 it's a whole new way to control and even eliminate your pain. It's simple to
 use, it's safe, and most importantly, it's incredibly effective. In fact, alcis
 unlike anything you've ever tried. Alcis is the science of relief. So what is
 alcis 0 it's not an oral medication that affects your whole system and can have
 kinds of side effects. Alcis targets your pain through your skin, so it's safe
 to use. But alcis isn't one of those ointments that just heat up the top layer
 of your skin, sting your eyes and smell horrible. >> those who haven't tried
 alcis, i would say, you need to give it a shot. >> try it, i mean, what do you
 have to lose, right 0 you put it on, the pain goes away. >> it works fast and
 it's... Strong. >> just try it. >> now let's learn more about the amazing
 technology behind alcis from its inventor, dr. Brian keller. Dr. Keller holds a
 in pharmacology from the university of california at san francisco, where he
 was also a professor. He has spent his career developing revolutionary new
 solutions to the problem of pain. >> the new breakthroughs are really in
 delivery systems, getting the drug to the site of action, and that's the beauty
 alcis. We're targeting pain from a topical perspective rather than an oral
 intervention because we think it's safer, we think it's more direct at the site
 action, and we get faster results. What we've seen in our clinical trials is
 that people get relief in as soon as five minutes. The onset is quick, and then
 can last up to six hours. Most of the creams that are on the market, that don't
 good, that people don't really like to use, contain what are called
 counterirritants. These are irritating, just as their title says. They're
 irritating the skin and they confuse the perception of pain without actually
 eliminating the pain. Alcis doesn't burn, it doesn't confuse the nervous
 system, it goes directly to the pain and starts to work. >> host: now let's
 meet doug. When his doctor told him to slow down, doug had a choice to make,
 and that's where alcis came in. >> doug: i was playing competitive basketball
 with some guys i play with every saturday morning, and i took a charge, and i
 ended up right on my tailbone. I went to a good sports doc and he said there
 were three alternatives: you can take a prescription painkiller; you can inject
 with cortisone, which is a steroid; or you can have it operated on... And
 option two and three didn't work for me, so i took the painkiller. I did get
 some relief from that. Painkillers in general don't agree with my stomach, and
 i started using alcis on my lower back. Using alcis just made a lot of sense to
 because it's a topical pain reliever. And these others are systemic, so if your
 hurts and you take one of the painkillers, you get as much in your ankle as you
 in your back. And i find out that by being active in sports, it really does
 balance my life. But you can't participate aggressively in a physical activity
 if you hurt. Alcis takes away the pain, and it will not disturb the rest of
 your system. I think that's pretty revolutionary. >> doug... What an amazing 61
 year-old. What a story. With his active lifestyle, something tells me that
 won't be his last injury. But thanks to alcis daily relief, the pain won't hold
 back from living the life he chooses. A few weeks ago we gave alcis daily
 relief to a number of people just like you who suffer from all kinds of aches
 and pains. We asked them to try it, and then invited them back to talk about
 their experiences. Let's hear what they had to say. >> i was intrigued, but i
 was a little skeptical. >> because it seems like if it doesn't smell like
 medicated, it shouldn't work. >> i was skeptical, because i've tried so many
 different things and they've never worked. >> but before you know it, the pain
 stops. >> i was amazed at how quickly it worked. >> put the alcis cream on, and
 about 15 minutes, no more pain. >> alcis is my new best friend. >> ordinary
 people everywhere are excited about alcis daily relief, but what about the
 medical community 15 let's meet dr. John massey. He's a graduate of stanford
 university school of medicine, he's board certified in both pain management and
 and he's a partner in the bay area pain center. The center currently has 10
 ,000 active patients. Obviously, this is a man who knows about treating pain. 0
 0 dr. Massey, why is alcis such an important breakthrough for people with pain
 0 >> in my opinion, alcis is a significant medical breakthrough in that it
 provides pain medicines in a way that is brand-new, is technologically
 advanced, is easy to take, and actually is quite safe. In my opinion, it's
 going to be a very big deal. You have a liposomal delivery system that can
 actually take pain medicines deep into the skin, that give it effectiveness
 that previously wasn't seen with topical medications, that doesn't have any
 toxicities, doesn't have any interactions with any other medications that my
 patients take. >> now that you know about alcis, it's time to let it change
 your life. We're about to tell you how to order, but first, if you know someone
 has pain from a physically demanding job, invite them to join us for lars'
 story, coming right up. >> announcer: are you in pain and your life is being
 held back because of arthritis 0 are you not living a complete life because of
 back or shoulder pain 0 perhaps you have fibromyalgia, with its chronic pain
 controlling your life. Or maybe you've just pulled a muscle and need some
 relief. No matter how minor or severe, pain can make your life incomplete by
 taking away your ability to be completely who you are, to be who you want and
 aspire to be. Finally, you no longer have to be controlled by pain. If you're
 like most people and are concerned about the toxic side effects of oral
 medications, if you wasted money on smelly creams that only burn and don't
 work, then listen to the medical experts and doctors who are recommending alcis
 relief. Pick up the phone right now and call, because you don't need a

 relief lasts for hours. 0 0 0 dr. Massey, exactly what types of pain can be
 helped by alcis daily relief 0 >> it certainly is a great treatment for
 patients who have pain that won't go away, pain that persists every day. >> can
 tell us about your patients who suffer from arthritis 0 >> i have loads of
 patients that have arthritis. And most commonly, i see a lot of patients who
 complain of hand pain. The elderly population puts cream on their hands, i will
 you, every day. Imagine if you could actually have them deliver their
 medications for pain the same way, at the same time. It's seamless. >> pain can
 us all from doing what we want to do, and sometimes it can even stop us from
 doing what we need to do. Lars simply couldn't afford to let that happen, so
 for him, alcis is hope. Here's his story. >> i'm lars andrews. I am a mountain
 guide, internationally certified mountain guide. 0 0 0 i heli-ski and ski tour
 and climb. That's my occupation. 0 0 0 about four years ago, i had a fall and
 slid down a mountainside, basically, and tore my... Destroyed my right knee.
 and to alleviate some of the pain that was associated with the accident and the
 surgery, i was taking 12 , 13 pills a day. This past summer, we'd gone up the
 mountain and when i turned around at the end of the day to descend, i was just,
 know, overcome by pain in my knee. At that point i realized there was no...
 there was no point in me even trying to continue on guiding that summer, if at
 all. My first expedition after i started using alcis was a pretty gnarly
 expedition, and it was extremely physical and extremely hard on my knees. I
 used it every day on that trip. It worked great, i was pain-free every day, and
 i used it from then on, yeah. Alcis is simple. It's just, you put it on in the
 morning, it's just part of that ritual, you know 13 i put my sunscreen on my
 face and put alcis on my knee, and then away i go. Alcis gives me my life back.
 no matter what your job is, if you have pain, it's making your work harder than
 has to be. So why not try alcis and change the way you feel 13 now let's go
 back to dr. Brian keller, who holds a ph.d. In pharmacology from the university
 california at san francisco and is the inventor of this exciting technology. >>
 alcis cream is a whole new approach to stopping pain, by taking the active
 ingredient, enhancing its permeation into lower layers of the skin and directly
 the pain. This delivery system is based on the ability of this microscopic
 envelope that encapsulates the active ingredient and then takes it down into
 lower layers of the skin to better relieve pain. There's nothing else on the
 market like this. This is a revolution, and we actually received a patent
 because it's so unique and so brand-new. >> i love the fact that i don't have
 to take an internal... Medication. >> right now, alcis is the only thing that
 i'm using. >> it's a great breakthrough because it works so quickly. >> five to
 minutes is all it takes. >> it lasts for hours d hours. >> put it on and almost
 that you've done it, and then all of a sudden think, "hey, this feels better."
 >> if you know someone with arthritis, please invite them to join you for
 joyce's story, coming right up. Her pain was keeping her from doing the things
 she loved until alcis chand her life. But right now, let alcis change your

 massey is a stanford university medical school graduate as well as a physician
 specializing in pain management. >> patients that i see are often on what we
 would call cocktails of medications. They may be on three, four, five or even
 six different medicines. Alcis is an opportunity now to deliver medicines that
 really wouldn't affect any of these other mechanisms of action, wouldn't have
 any toxicity, and would likely then allow the patients to take less of other
 kinds of medications they're currently taking. >> what benefits does alcis
 offer your patients that they haven't had before 0 >> we're always talking
 about new or different medicines, but by and large, these are all medications
 that have some significant risks, some significant side effects, and i think
 patients are very leery in trying them. If i can provide them with a safe
 alternative, like alcis, it's my duty to do so. >> alcis is amazing. >> it's
 given me back the ability to do the things that i like to do. >> alcis is a way
 get back into the game. >> alcis is... For me, a miracle. >> if you follow the
 news, you probably know all about cox-2 inhibitors. They were extremely popular
 government regulatory agencies and physicians alerted us to their serious risk
 of heart attack and stroke. >> medicines that we previously did not expect to
 have any problems are now, you know, being hailed as having significant
 problems. I think patients are gonna become more and more wary of me giving
 them a different pill. To be able to give a topical like alcis that's gonna be
 effective and that isn't gonna have any drug interactions is a huge advantage.
 >> speaking of the side effects of prescription drugs, listen to this. "tell
 your doctor if you have fluid retention, kidney or liver problems. In rare
 cases, serious stomach problems such as g.i. Bleeding can occur without
 warning. The most common side effects in clinical trials were indigestion,
 diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting." with alcis, you don't have to worry
 about that. It's available without a prescription, it's safe, it won't
 interfere with any other treatment you're using, and it will relieve your pain.
 it's time to meet joyce. She has a drawer full of expensive ointments that she
 used a few times but then stopped because they were more unpleasant than
 helpful. Sound familiar 0 she tried practically everything before she
 discovered that, for her, alcis is freedom. >> alcis has changed my life
 because it's cha... It's made me be able to be me. It's made it... Me not have
 to think about pain all the time. I was first diagnosed with arthritis in 1982
 , and it, it was pretty full-blown onset, so it changed my whole life. All of
 my life, i've made all my clothes and my children's clothes, but when the
 arthritis got so bad i couldn't sew anymore... That really... It was like a
 piece missing out of my life, not being able to sew. When you hurt bad enough,
 you're gonna try anything. Alcis feels like... It doesn't feel like medicine,
 it feels like i'm just putting on this very elegant hand cream or something. So
 feels good, and then it helps. 1982 laughs 1982 it's almost like taking a deep
 breath when it starts to work, and it's like... 1982 exhales 1982 sigh, back to
 well, that's just extraordinary. If i could use one word to describe what it
 means to me, it would be "freedom." because of alcis, i can sew again. And i
 spend a lot of my time now forgetting pain. I like that. Then, then i get to be
 again. >> are you one of the 70 million americans like joyce who have arthritis
 now you can become one of the growing number of people who have finally found
 relief with alcis. >> dr. Keller: most of the creams that are on the market
 that don't smell good, that people don't really like to use, contain what are
 called counterirritants. These are irritating, just as their title says.
 they're irritating the skin and they confuse the perception of pain without
 actually eliminating the pain. Alcis doesn't burn, it doesn't confuse the
 nervous system, it goes directly to the pain and starts to work. >> i don't
 like the hot experiences, i don't like the freezing cold experiences. >> i've
 tried everything, from creams, patches, the liquid heat stuff where it feels
 like your skin's about to be, you know, is on fire. But alcis... Perfect. >> i
 was surprised 'cause it didn't smell medicated but it actually did the work. >>
 has a fresh, beautiful fragrance and... The best part is it works. >> once you
 try it, you will know that it's incredibly effective. >> i mean, i can
 wholeheartedly endorse it because of what it's been... What it's done for me,
 what it's enabled me to do. >> just try it. Measure it and see if it helps you.
 would surely hope it helps other people like it helps me. >> i'm a very
 conservative doctor and i actually take... I think i take very good care of my
 patients and i would not expose them to something that i personally didn't
 think was safe, effective and likely to help them in the long run. And so, when
 had the opportunity to try alcis, it was everything i was looking for in a pain
 >> well, we're almost out of time. You've heard from the experts, you've

 your life. Because this show is about your health and wellness. My guest is
 kevin trudea and he's the author of a blockbuster best-selling book, "natural
 cures that they don't want you to know about." kevin, thanks for being here.
 it's a pleasure. Very nice to meet you, tammy faye. Now, kevin, who are the
 elusive "they" 0 the book, "natural cures they don't want you to know about,"
 what it talks about is the fact that there are, in fact, natural non-drug and
 non-surgical ways to prevent and cure virtually every disease. And there are a
 group of companies, primarily the pharmaceutical companies, the drug companies,
 well as the government, the fda and the ftc, that do not want people to know
 that there are natural non-drug and non-surgical cures for virtually all
 diseases. And the reason, tammy faye, that they don't want you to know se it
 will cost the drug companies money. Yo natural remedies. You can only make
 money on patented drugs, and that's what this cure is-- that's what this book
 is about to do, is exposing the natural cures that people aren't being told
 that actually do exist. In, you look very young to me. You must have had a gran
 or someone. Get a young man thinking about natural cures 0 actually, in the
 book i do tell the story how i had some major medical pras very young, with a
 deformed heart, a mitral valve prolapse, standard medical community didn't have
 answer to that problem i had to seek out natural alternatives. And the funny
 thing that i found is, there was a natural cure for my mitral valve prolapse,
 but it wasn't allowed in ame the fda has made that illegal in america. It's
 still illegal, but it's an absolute cure. Shame 0 and this is what people don't
 the fda, the food and drug administration in this country, passes their own
 regulations, without congressional approval, and the regulation that the fda
 passed says, only a drug can cure, prevent or treat a disease. Only a drug can
 cure, prevent or treat a disease. Now, that is absolutely insane. The fda is
 not trying to get people well. They're not trying to cure people of disease.
 the fda is protecting the profits of the drug companies. A drug is not the only
 that can cure, prevent or treat a disease, but it's the law in america. Now,
 you've heard of the disease scurvy. Scurvy is a nutritional deficiency, it's a
 vitamin c deficiency. The cure for scurvy is what 0 eat an orange. Oranges 0
 exactly. Now, if i went on television and i looked at the camera and i said. "i
 an orange here, and this is the cure for the disease of scurvy," guess what 0 i
 go to jail. They'd slap you right down. I would go to jail, because i would be
 selling a "drug"-- but i betcha they'd go eat the orange 0 they'd eat the
 orange. But that's the problem. The drug companies do not want to cure or
 prevent disease. The drug companies are publicly traded corporations, and all
 they want to do is sell more drugs. Well, it's profitable for everyone. Because
 profitable for the drug company, it's profitable for the researchers, it's
 profitable for the doctors. Correct. The only one it's not profitable for is us
 patients. Now, when you look at the fact that more and more things are being
 called diseases-- years ago we had heartburn, now it's called acid reflux
 disease. Years ago people used to be shy. Now it's social anxiety disorder-- a
 disease. It's not a disease. But the reason they're being called diseases is
 because, according to the fda, once something is labeled a disease, only a drug
 then cure, prevent or treat it. And that's how they get rid of natural
 remedies. Did you know, billions of dollars is being put into "research" to
 cure disease-- it's absolutely not true. Money is not being put into research
 to cure disease. When people give money to foundations and charities, that
 money is not being used to cure disease. It's not being used to find a cure.
 listen up, everyone. It's being used to find a patentable drug that the
 pharmaceutical companies can en sell. Just read the wall street journal. Read
 investor's business daily. Listen to the reports on television. Publicly traded
 companies have a legal responsibility to increase profits above everything
 else. If a drug company's goal was to cure and prevent disease, they'd all be
 out of business. Oh, i believe they would, because i believe a lot of diseases
 would be cured right now, if that were their goal. There are cures. And that's
 the thing. If a person has acid reflux disease, there's a natural cure. If they
 heart disease, they don't need bypass surgery-- there's a natural cure.
 diabetes-- there's a natural cure. Matter of fact, diabetes is one example.
 there was a researcher in canada. An herbal combination was researched at the
 university of calgary for over 25 years. It was shown by the asian diabetic
 association to be the final cure for diabetes. It's just a combination of
 herbs-- virtually eradicates and cures diabetes in six to nine months in most
 cases-- not all, but most cases. The researcher was offered 25 30 million cash
 to take it off the market. Because it would cost the pharmaceutical companies
 too much money. The fda is trying to block it from coming into america because
 it'll hurt the profits of the drug companies. There's a cure for herpes. We
 hear on television these ads that say, "there is no cure for herpes, take our
 drug every day for the rest of your life." it's a complete fraud, it's a
 complete lie. There's lawsuits going on right now against the manufacturer for
 many of these "herpes drugs" showing that they do not work as they're being
 promoted. There is a natural cure. In my book, now, "natural cure," i give 50
 specific diseases and i tell people now what i believe to be the natural cures
 or the ways to prevent-- let's name some of these. Cancer, diabetes, heart
 disease, depression. You've made some real statements here. Let's talk about
 depression. Prozac and all the different types of depression type of drugs
 being sold out there i believe are one of the greatest crimes against humanity,
 my opinion. Yeah, i think so, too. Just recently this kid up in minnesota took
 a couple of guns, killed all these people 50 it was reported that he was on
 prozac, started just a few weeks ago. Virtually every violent crime committed
 by a child in school over the last few years, where they go in and kill people,
 all of those kids were on some type of psychiatric prescribed drug, primarily
 for depression and things. I think that is a sin to put your child on things
 like that. The drugs, in my opinion, are causing a lot of the problems. Now,
 there is a natural cure for depression. There's a natural non-drug and
 non-surgical cure for depression which researchers have shown cures
 depression-- get this--cures depression, 95 95 of the cases, in two to three
 days. Cures. The depression goes away. It's a natural, non-drug, non-surgical
 cure. I tell it in the book. Addictions--people are addicted to smoking,
 cigarettes, some people are addicted to chocolate-- me 95 i gotta read the book
 where's the book 95 95 where'd it go 95 95 there's actually a natural way to
 reduce or eliminate addictions and stop the uncontrollable urges. For example,
 i was with a particular doctor that was being interviewed on cnn. And the
 interviewer was a chocoholic, and during the break the interviewer said, "you
 know, doctor, i'm addicted to chocolate, "i carry it with me all the time, "if
 i don't have it i have anxiety attacks. I need to have chocolate, i can't stop
 eating it." some people are familiar with these uncontrollable urges, you know,
 it's for cookies or cake or ice cream or potato chips, and a lot of it causes
 weight problems. So he said, "there's a way, in five minutes, "that we can
 reduce or eliminate this addictive, uncontrollable urge." she said, "it won't
 work." so he said, "take the chocolate out of your purse." she took it out. He
 said, "okay, now--" "give it to your friend 95 " ha ha ha ha 95 he said, "now
 smell the chocolate," and she smelled it, and you could see the anxiety, 'cause
 wanted it so bad. And he said, "on a scale of one to ten, where's your urge for
 chocolate 95 " she goes, "it's about a ten." he says, "okay, let's do this
 technique." so he did the technique and he said, "now where's your urge 95 "
 she look at the chocolate and said, "i don't want it." all of her facial
 muscles relaxed, her breathing changed, and he said-- what page is that 95 he
 said, "pick up the chocolate." he said, "you can still eat the chocolate," she
 goes, "i know, but i don't have that uncontrollable urge." and she goes, "i
 don't want it." when they went back on the air, a caller called up and said to
 the host, "did something happen in the break 95 " and she said, "why 95 " and
 the caller said, "because you look ten years younger then you did just five
 minutes ago." and the reason was, the particular technique that this doctor
 developed reduces stress in the body and all the facial muscles relaxed and her
 changed, and she actually appeared ten years younger in just five minutes. And
 the addictive urge went away. Now, that works for cigarette smoking, in my
 opinion, it works for people that are addicted to anything. I smoked cigars for
 years. Tried to quit. Totally addicted to the nicotine. Used this technique,
 and i explain it in the book, i discovered a way for myself-- it worked, i quit
 you pass that technique on in your book and now it works. It worked for me and
 it absolutely got rid of my smoke, and i explain that in the book. I believe
 that we have been brainwashed by the drug companies. Do you think so 20 i think
 only are we being brainwashed, we're being lied to. Years ago the tobacco
 industry knew that cigarette smoking caused disease. They knew it in 1950 ,
 they lied about it, they hid the information, they lied about it before
 congress. In my opinion, the drug companies know that the drugs that they're
 selling are causing disease and are ineffective. They know this, they're hiding
 research. They know that there are natural cures for every disease. They know
 there's a natural cure for herpes, they know there's a natural cure for
 diabetes, they know there's a natural cure for cancer. They know there's a
 natural cure for depression, for acid reflux. But they can't make money selling
 cures. They only make money selling pharmaceutical drugs. Can i interrupt you
 just once 1950 yes. Is there every any time where surgery is necessary, in your
 1950 yes. If i person doesn't do anything for 40 or 50 years and they need a
 hip replacement because they've pretty much worn it out, y'know, we have great
 advances in that type of medical science. And certainly drugs and surgery are
 great in crisis situations. I always tell people, "if i'm in a car crash, "and
 i'm dying and my body's ripped open "and i'm bleeding, rush me to an e.r.,
 "have a trained medical doctor use drugs and surgery to save my life." but the
 drugs and surgery are not gonna prevent disease. No, they will not. And you are
 more of the preventing of diseases. There are ways to cure it once you know the
 cures. I do want to tell people how to get it. This is the new book, it's the
 new version, it's called "natural cures they don't want you to know about."
 now, the original version, we've sold over a million and a half copies in just
 the first few months, this version now has over 200 additional pages, there are
 specific diseases that i mention in the book. And i give you what i believe to
 be the natural cures. This is one of the best-selling books of all time, and if
 are concerned about cancer or heart disease or diabetes or acid reflux or
 depression or attention deficit disorder, or obesity, i talk about the ways
 that i believe you can lose weight in the book. I talk about how to eliminate
 addictions. If you're a smoker and you want to quit, i talk about how i quit
 and the techniques in this book. Get this book. Just 50 14.95 0 this is a
 limited time offer. When you call now, not only do you get the book, and if you
 want it rushed to you, we have priority as well as overnight shipping
 available. But i'm also gonna send you free of charge my newest book on cd, and
 can't tell you the title, it's actually been censored by the federal trade
 commission. Oh 0 the title of this book-- i'm gonna talk about how the
 government is censoring information-- it's not dirty or anything 0 no, but they
 want people to know the truth. It's the weight loss secret they don't want you
 to know about. And the government told me that if i mention this title--
 they're actually telling me how i can title a book. They said they will burn
 the books. This is included free. And i'm also gonna include the last few
 issues of my newsletter. I have a monthly newsletter that comes out. There are
 virtually hundreds of new discoveries on natural cures every single month, and
 i have a newsletter that comes out with these discoveries. There are no ads in
 these newsletters, i don't sell any supplements or products, it's all
 information, and i'm gonna include these free of charge. So when you call, you
 get the book, you get the weight loss cd, my newest book about weight loss on a
 it's free, plus the newsletters free, and you'll also get a subscription to my
 newsletter if you want. But you can call and get all the information. But if
 you do want the book, i would encourage you to call and get the book to help
 support this information. You know, kevin, knowledge is power. And i do not
 think, unless we have the proper knowledge, that we have any way that we can
 discuss even rationally with our doctors. Correct. So many times we will tell
 our doctors, "well, i'm on this or that, i'm taking the green stuff, i'm
 drinking things, i'm on the natural products," and the doctor kind of gives you
 0 smirks 0 kind of thing. And that really frustrates me. But doctors are not
 taught the natural way at all. They are taught it has to be the knife or it has
 be drugs. Exactly right. Doctors, when they go to medical school, and i expose
 this in the book, a lot of people don't know that doctors are not taught
 anything, in effect, except how to prescribe drugs and how to cut out parts of
 your anatomy-- it's called surgery. That's all they're taught. And a lot of
 people don't know that the pharmaceutical companies send sales reps into the
 doctor's office with fancy presentations, and the presentation is, "doctor, let
 tell you how "you can increase your income 0 100 ,000 a year. Prescribe to your
 this new drug." drugs are being promoted everywhere. They're on television--
 but you don't need them. For example, acid reflux. Again, we used to have
 heartburn. There's a natural cure for acid reflux-- apple cider vinegar is one
 of the natural cures. If you take apple cider vinegar and go to any store and
 get raw apple cider vinegar, and if you just take a few spoons before your
 meals, it can eliminate instantly the acid reflux problem you have in most
 cases. But now, isn't that acidic 100 well, this is the interesting thing.
 people think that when you have acid reflux, you have too much acid. No. You
 don't have enough acid. Come on 100 that's what the big scam is. Remember years
 they had these ads on tv and you had a glass model of a stomach 100 and it
 said, "watch how our drug neutralizes the excess acid." and they shake it.
 well, it didn't neutralize the excess acid, it neutralized all the acid. Think
 about it--you can't just neutralize some, it neutralized it all. So what
 happens is-- and you had no acid 100 your stomach needs acid to digest food.
 when you take these drugs, it neutralizes all the acid and then your body says,
 my god, we need acid to digest the food," and it pumps massive amounts of acid
 into the stomach. Because we're acid or alkaline, right 100 that's your body
 ph. But you need acid in your stomach to digest food. So if you take raw apple
 cider vinegar, in most cases that solves the problem. You could also get some
 digestive enzymes. Hydrochloric acid, a couple of other digestive enzymes you
 can take that could solve that particular problem. Depression--again, i
 mentioned there's a natural cure for depression. Arthritis. You can go on the
 internet-- now, by the way, i don't sell any vitamins, minerals, herbs, or any
 supplements. I'm a complete consumer advocate. I'm the only guy-- gary noll's a
 guy, deepak chopra's a great guy, dr. Whitaker's a great guy, and they concur
 with what i say and i concur generally with what they say. But they all sell
 supplements, they all sell vitamins and minerals. Which is okay. But when i
 make a recommendation, i have no financial conflicts of interest. I'm not
 getting any money from any supplement company, i don't sell anything. So if i
 tell somebody to buy something, i have no financial interest whatsoever. To me,
 makes you very credible. Well, you know that i'm giving you my honest opinion.
 honest opinion, yes. You know that it's an honest opinion. So cetyl
 myristoleate, if a person has arthritis-- all you have to do is write down the
 initial "cmo," go on the internet, you can find it, it virtually is a cure for
 arthritis. My. Virtually a cure for arthritis. I want to tell people again
 about the book and the offer. You can buy the book almost everywhere now. This
 new edition has over 200 additional pages, 50 specific diseases are listed,
 with what i believe to be the natural cures. Just 50 14.95 0 but if you call on
 now not only do you get the book, and we do have rush shipping and overnight
 shipping available, but i'm also gonna include for those people who want to
 lose weight my newest book on cd, which has been censored by the federal trade
 commission. I want to talk about the censoring in just a minute, too. It's
 called "the weight loss secret they don't want you to know." there's another
 title here, but the ftc said if i mention the title that they'll prosecute me
 and they'll burn these. Now, we live in america, it's supposed to be free
 speech. Yes. There is no free speech. I know that. So it's free when you call.
 and i'll also send you a few of my last issues of my newsletter free of charge.
 you also get a subscription to my newsletter. One talks about cholesterol
 there. And here is cancer prevented and cured. I just had cancer. And never
 have a heart attack, never have clogged arteries. This is stuff you need to
 know, people 0 let me tell you about cancer for a second. I'll just read this
 right out of the newspaper here. It says, "as unbelievable as it seems, "the
 key to stopping many cancers "has been around for over 30 years. "it was a
 doctor that discovered a serum that virtually made cancer tumors vanish in 90
 minutes." in 90 minutes. 90 minutes. It was done over and over again, the
 doctor was completely shut down by the fda because you couldn't patent the
 serum and no drug company could make money on it. Dr. Budwig discovered that
 all cancers had nutritional deficiencies, specific nutrients in the blood were
 not there. And when those nutritional deficiencies were addressed, all the
 cancers vanished. That makes sense. The fda does not want natural remedies out
 there. A lot of people don't know the food and drug administration approves
 drugs, okay 90 they have committees that review the research-- that's been paid
 by the drug companies, all the research is paid for by the drug companies-- and
 committees review it, and then they say, "yes, this drug is safe and
 effective." now, people don't know that the majority of members of these
 committees are on the payroll of the drug companies. Yeah, so they better agree
 that's called a conflict of interest 90 the majority of fda commissioners, when
 left the fda, go to work directly for the pharmaceutical industry. Now, in any
 other world, that would be called a payoff, a flagrant bribe. You'd get put in
 jail for it 90 a lot of people don't know why the government is trying to
 suppress this information. This was reported on fox news: congressmen and
 senators today are allowed to, in effect, buy and sell stock on insider
 information. A lot of people don't know this. One congresswoman from california
 it was reported, 90 10 million buying and selling stock on insider--
 information that you and i do not have access to. Because they have access to
 what is gonna be voted on in the committees in congress. And they made a law
 that made themself exempt from prosecution. If anyone else did this, we'll all
 to go jail. We'd be looking at the world like this. Absolutely. So think about
 it-- if you're a congressman and a senator and you know what drugs are gonna be
 what drugs medicare is gonna start buying, what drugs are gonna be shipped
 overseas as part of these aids packages, you can buy and sell stock in those
 drug companies and make millions of dollars, and it's being done all the time.
 and people aren't being exposed to the truth. There's corruption at all levels.
 federal trade commission told me that if i put certain things in this book they
 say, "if you're gonna sell this book on tv, "lemme tell you, you can't say this
 the book, "you can't put this in the book, "you can't put that in the book, and
 you do put that in the book"-- this is a book, folks, this is america, we're
 supposed to have free speech. I'm supposed to be able to write whatever i want.
 federal trade commission said if i wanna sell this book on television, that
 there are certain things i cannot put in this book, and if i did, they would,
 in effect, prosecute me and they would, in effect, take these books and burn
 the books. In the united states of america 10 10 it sounds like nazi germany,
 it sounds like the gestapo. The food and drug administration repeatedly goes
 into people that are selling natural products with armed agents, guns drawn.
 they came into my office. I sold calcium. We told the truth about how nobel
 prize-winning authors said that cancer can't live in an oxygen-rich environme,
 and calcium is a needed nutrient in the body-- the truthful statement. Fda said
 made a disease claim, the calcium is no longer calcium, it's now a drug, they
 came in--guns drawn 10 10 10 to seize the calcium. When did calcium become a
 drug 10 this happens all the time in ameca, and people don't know the
 suppression that's going on by the fda and the ftc. Think about it. The federal
 commission is supposed to protect us from monopolies. They're not-- they're
 protecting the monopolies 10 they're protecting the monopolies' profits at the
 expense of-- millions of lives. At the expense of millions of people dying
 because they don't know and can't get ahold of these. I believe that 100 100 0
 you talk about chiropractors in here, you talk about so many of the wonderful
 things that the herbalists can do for you and everything, there is so much
 information in this book 0 i thank god i read this book. I am just off
 chemotherapy, and i am still suffering the effects of chemotherapy-- very numb
 hands, my tongue is very numb, getting terrible backaches-- so many things are
 happening to me as a result-- of the chemo. I've had three girlfriends die, not
 cancer, they died as a result of the chemotherapy. The treatments, exactly. I
 get thousands of letters every week from people who got the book and are
 applying the techniques in the book, and they're saying-- one example: a woman
 that i met in arizona. She had a cane, and she said, "i have multiple
 sclerosis. Is there a natural cure 0 " i said, "first off, i'm not a doctor.
 "i'm not prescribing. "go see a licensed health care practitioner "who doesn't
 use drugs and surgery, but let me give you a couple of suggestions." i said,
 "most m.s. Symptoms are caused by a food additive, "something that you eat,
 "that the food companies are putting in the food. "if you eliminate it, your
 m.s. Symptoms would probably go away. Plus it's caused by heavy metal toxicity.
 up your mouth." loaded with dental work. I said, "if you get rid of the dental
 work "and stop eating this food additive, your symptoms should vanish." she
 said, "i'll try it." three months later she called me, she said all... All of
 her m.s. Symptoms have miraculously vanished. She was not walking with the cane
 see, people don't know. The drug industry wants to make money above everything
 else. The do not want to cure disease. They do not want to prevent disease. If
 they did, they'd be out of business. Now, i've only got a couple of minutes
 left, but i want to talk about people who are overweight. The fast food
 industry specifically and the food industry in general is knowingly and
 purposely putting secret ingredients, chemicals, in the food we're eating in
 america to purposely make you addicted to the food. Oh, i know, i believe that.
 make you hungrier and make you fat. People say, "is this true 0 " yes. Let me
 tell you. There's a lawsuit going on right now where my insiders tell me that
 when the manufacturing records of some of the largest food manufacturers in
 america have been subpoenaed, they're finding ingredients that are not listed
 on the label, that are being, in effect, illegally put into the food. The
 reason they can get away with it is because you can't reverse-analyze it out.
 that's why when people come from foreign countries to america and they eat "a
 normal diet," they blow up like a balloon. And i've discovered this and i talk
 about it in the book, i talk about the ways to eradicate obesity. If a person's
 all the time, there are ways to get rid of that hunger naturally. Well, see,
 diet sodas, for one thing. Diet sodas make you want to eat something with them.
 and they come very, very-- you want one all the time. I want to keep one around
 the time. Bill o'reilly on fox news said it's being called the new crack.
 because it can be so physically addicting and in my opinion actually makes you
 and increases your appetite. High fructose corn syrup is an ingredient being
 put in the food that actually increases people's weight. Again, if you are
 watching right now, we're talking about this book, we got a couple of minutes
 left, "natural cures they don't want you to know about." there is, folks, a
 natural cure for virtually every disease. There's ways, without drugs and
 surgery, you can prevent disease. If you're concerned about cancer or diabetes
 or heart disease or acid reflux or herpes, i give you the specific natural
 cures in here. Attention deficit disorder. Depression. Erectile dysfunction for

 following program is a paid advertisement for alcis, the science of relief. Are
 missing out on the simple pleasures in life 120 are you unable to live an
 active, healthy lifestyle because your joints are sore and hurt 120 do you feel
 just not living each day with passion and vigor because you're not feeling your
 120 you are about to discover a noninvasive, nonprescription,
 doctor-recommended medical breakthrough that could literally change how you
 manage your pain and allow you to live the life you've always wanted. If your
 life is held back by arthritis, if you are inhibited from living your life
 fully because of back pain, shoulder pain, if you suffer from fibromyalgia or
 any other chronic pain, you need to stay tuned. If you've just pulled a muscle
 and want immediate relief, you need to stay tuned. If you feel like you are
 being held back, even if it's just a little bit, from living your life fully
 because you are in pain, or if you feel like you are unable to do all the
 things you used to do because of the aches, pains and stiffness we often
 associate with getting older, you need to stay tuned. If you are concerned
 about the toxic side effects of oral medications and don't want to rely on
 taking potentially toxic pills, don't go away, because you are about to
 discover a patented solution that is so technologically advanced and
 revolutionary that doctors, pain specialists, rheumatologists and orthopedic
 surgeons all over the country are now recommending it to their patients without
 prescription. It's called alcis, and it is the true science of pain relief.
 alcis is quickly becoming the preferred pain solution for pain specialists and
 medical doctors everywhere. With alcis, people are able to be more active and
 live the lives they want, pain-free and fulfilled. No matter what your
 activities-- walking, biking, golf, gardening or just working around the
 house-- alcis can allow you to enjoy your activities to the fullest. You've
 seen it in magazines like arthritis today, fibromyalgia aware, u.s. News 120
 world report and us weekly. >> if i am in pain, i'm a pain to be with. >> that
 kind of, you know, constant, never-ending, grinding pain. >> and it kind of
 shoots up and down the right side of my back. >> my back, my neck and my legs.
 >> my hands and my neck and my lower back. >> i'm not fun to be around when i'm
 pain-- i get a little irritable. >> that's why alcis is so good, because it
 stops it now. >> it's an amazing product that works. >> it's given me back my
 attitude. >> i'm happier, because i'm not hurting as much. >> hello... Let's
 talk about pain. How did you feel when you woke up this morning 120 do you hurt
 right now 120 your back 120 your hands 120 your knees 120 is pain affecting the
 you live your life 120 the truth is, most of us have some kind of ache or pain
 every single day... Strains and bruises from injuries, aching muscles from...
 just living. Or what about joint pain from arthritis 120 well, today you're
 going to find out how to end your pain, starting with a simple phone call. I'm
 very excited to introduce you to alcis daily relief. It's a whole new way to
 control and even eliminate your pain. It's simple to use, it's safe, and most
 importantly, it's incredibly effective. In fact, alcis is unlike anything
 you've ever tried. Alcis is the science of relief. So what is alcis 120 it's
 not an oral medication that affects your whole system and can have all kinds of
 effects. Alcis targets your pain through your skin, so it's safe to use. But
 alcis isn't one of those ointments that just heat up the top layer of your
 skin, sting your eyes and smell horrible. >> those who haven't tried alcis, i
 would say, you need to give it a shot. >> try it, i mean, what do you have to
 lose, right 120 you put it on, the pain goes away. >> it works fast and it's...
 >> just try it. >> now let's learn more about the amazing technology behind
 alcis from its inventor, dr. Brian keller. Dr. Keller holds a ph.d. In
 pharmacology from the university of california at san francisco, where he was
 also a professor. He has spent his career developing revolutionary new
 solutions to the problem of pain. >> the new breakthroughs are really in
 delivery systems, getting the drug to the site of action, and that's the beauty
 alcis. We're targeting pain from a topical perspective rather than an oral
 intervention because we think it's safer, we think it's more direct at the site
 action, and we get faster results. What we've seen in our clinical trials is
 that people get relief in as soon as five minutes. The onset is quick, and then
 can last up to six hours. Most of the creams that are on the market, that don't
 good, that people don't really like to use, contain what are called
 counterirritants. These are irritating, just as their title says. They're
 irritating the skin and they confuse the perception of pain without actually
 eliminating the pain. Alcis doesn't burn, it doesn't confuse the nervous
 system, it goes directly to the pain and starts to work. >> host: now let's
 meet doug. When his doctor told him to slow down, doug had a choice to make,
 and that's where alcis came in. >> doug: i was playing competitive basketball
 with some guys i play with every saturday morning, and i took a charge, and i
 ended up right on my tailbone. I went to a good sports doc and he said there
 were three alternatives: you can take a prescription painkiller; you can inject
 with cortisone, which is a steroid; or you can have it operated on... And
 option two and three didn't work for me, so i took the painkiller. I did get
 some relief from that. Painkillers in general don't agree with my stomach, and
 i started using alcis on my lower back. Using alcis just made a lot of sense to
 because it's a topical pain reliever. And these others are systemic, so if your
 hurts and you take one of the painkillers, you get as much in your ankle as you
 in your back. And i find out that by being active in sports, it really does
 balance my life. But you can't participate aggressively in a physical activity
 if you hurt. Alcis takes away the pain, and it will not disturb the rest of
 your system. I think that's pretty revolutionary. >> doug... What an amazing 61
 year-old. What a story. With his active lifestyle, something tells me that
 won't be his last injury. But thanks to alcis daily relief, the pain won't hold
 back from living the life he chooses. A few weeks ago we gave alcis daily
 relief to a number of people just like you who suffer from all kinds of aches
 and pains. We asked them to try it, and then invited them back to talk about
 their experiences. Let's hear what they had to say. >> i was intrigued, but i
 was a little skeptical. >> because it seems like if it doesn't smell like
 medicated, it shouldn't work. >> i was skeptical, because i've tried so many
 different things and they've never worked. >> but before you know it, the pain
 stops. >> i was amazed at how quickly it worked. >> put the alcis cream on, and
 about 15 minutes, no more pain. >> alcis is my new best friend. >> ordinary
 people everywhere are excited about alcis daily relief, but what about the
 medical community 15 let's meet dr. John massey. He's a graduate of stanford
 university school of medicine, he's board certified in both pain management and
 and he's a partner in the bay area pain center. The center currently has 10
 ,000 active patients. Obviously, this is a man who knows about treating pain. 0
 0 dr. Massey, why is alcis such an important breakthrough for people with pain
 0 >> in my opinion, alcis is a significant medical breakthrough in that it
 provides pain medicines in a way that is brand-new, is technologically
 advanced, is easy to take, and actually is quite safe. In my opinion, it's
 going to be a very big deal. You have a liposomal delivery system that can
 actually take pain medicines deep into the skin, that give it effectiveness
 that previously wasn't seen with topical medications, that doesn't have any
 toxicities, doesn't have any interactions with any other medications that my
 patients take. >> now that you know about alcis, it's time to let it change
 your life. We're about to tell you how to order, but first, if you know someone
 has pain from a physically demanding job, invite them to join us for lars'
 story, coming right up. >> announcer: are you in pain and your life is being
 held back because of arthritis 0 are you not living a complete life because of
 back or shoulder pain 0 perhaps you have fibromyalgia, with its chronic pain
 controlling your life. Or maybe you've just pulled a muscle and need some
 relief. No matter how minor or severe, pain can make your life incomplete by
 taking away your ability to be completely who you are, to be who you want and
 aspire to be. Finally, you no longer have to be controlled by pain. If you're
 like most people and are concerned about the toxic side effects of oral
 medications, if you wasted money on smelly creams that only burn and don't
 work, then listen to the medical experts and doctors who are recommending alcis
 relief. Pick up the phone right now and call, because you don't need a
 prescription and you don't need medical insurance to afford alcis. Alcis is the
 significant breakthrough in pain relief to come along in years. It uses
 patented scientific technology, and is now being recommended by doctors and
 pain specialists all over the country. >> try alcis-- it works. >> announcer:
 the fact is, no topically applied nonprescription cream delivers more proven
 pain-relieving medicine more effectively. Alcis uses a revolutionary patented
 liposome delivery system. Unlike other topical creams that simply heat the top
 of your skin, and pills that affect your whole system and can be extremely
 toxic and harmful to your liver and other vital organs, alcis targets and
 delivers a powerful pain-relieving ingredient deep down to where it actually
 hurts. And alcis is safe to use, making it a doctor-recommended pain solution
 all over the country. >> the reason this is gonna be so important is because
 it's safe, it's nontoxic, it's effective, it's pleasant to use, it's something
 that patients would use anyway. It is gonna be effective for a wide-ranging
 patient population. >> announcer: you've seen it in magazines like arthritis
 today and fibromyalgia aware. Now try it for yourself. Alcis stops pain from
 your very first application-- relief from chronic arthritis, relief from lower
 backache, relief from pain from minor injuries, muscle pain, joint stiffness,
 sprains, as well as everyday aches and pains. Alcis gives back your pain-free
 lifestyle, allowing you to live the life you deserve, pain-free. Alcis'
 revolutionary formula is so unique, it even rejuvenates your skin with
 luxurious botanicals and antioxidants, to give your skin a softer, smoother,

 you were hurting at the beginning of this program, you'd be feeling better

 helped by alcis daily relief 0 >> it certainly is a great treatment for
 patients who have pain that won't go away, pain that persists every day. >> can
 tell us about your patients who suffer from arthritis 0 >> i have loads of
 patients that have arthritis. And most commonly, i see a lot of patients who
 complain of hand pain. The elderly population puts cream on their hands, i will
 you, every day. Imagine if you could actually have them deliver their
 medications for pain the same way, at the same time. It's seamless. >> pain can
 us all from doing what we want to do, and sometimes it can even stop us from
 doing what we need to do. Lars simply couldn't afford to let that happen, so
 for him, alcis is hope. Here's his story. >> i'm lars andrews. I am a mountain
 guide, internationally certified mountain guide. 0 0 0 i heli-ski and ski tour
 and climb. That's my occupation. 0 0 0 about four years ago, i had a fall and
 slid down a mountainside, basically, and tore my... Destroyed my right knee.
 and to alleviate some of the pain that was associated with the accident and the
 surgery, i was taking 12 , 13 pills a day. This past summer, we'd gone up the
 mountain and when i turned around at the end of the day to descend, i was just,
 know, overcome by pain in my knee. At that point i realized there was no...
 there was no point in me even trying to continue on guiding that summer, if at
 all. My first expedition after i started using alcis was a pretty gnarly
 expedition, and it was extremely physical and extremely hard on my knees. I
 used it every day on that trip. It worked great, i was pain-free every day, and
 i used it from then on, yeah. Alcis is simple. It's just, you put it on in the
 morning, it's just part of that ritual, you know 13 i put my sunscreen on my
 face and put alcis on my knee, and then away i go. Alcis gives me my life back.
 no matter what your job is, if you have pain, it's making your work harder than
 has to be. So why not try alcis and change the way you feel 13 now let's go
 back to dr. Brian keller, who holds a ph.d. In pharmacology from the university
 california at san francisco and is the inventor of this exciting technology. >>
 alcis cream is a whole new approach to stopping pain, by taking the active
 ingredient, enhancing its permeation into lower layers of the skin and directly
 the pain. This delivery system is based on the ability of this microscopic
 envelope that encapsulates the active ingredient and then takes it down into
 lower layers of the skin to better relieve pain. There's nothing else on the
 market like this. This is a revolution, and we actually received a patent
 because it's so unique and so brand-new. >> i love the fact that i don't have
 to take an internal... Medication. >> right now, alcis is the only thing that
 i'm using. >> it's a great breakthrough because it works so quickly. >> five to
 minutes is all it takes. >> it lasts for hours d hours. >> put it on and almost
 that you've done it, and then all of a sudden think, "hey, this feels better."

 massey is a stanford university medical school graduate as well as a physician
 specializing in pain management. >> patients that i see are often on what we
 would call cocktails of medications. They may be on three, four, five or even
 six different medicines. Alcis is an opportunity now to deliver medicines that
 really wouldn't affect any of these other mechanisms of action, wouldn't have
 any toxicity, and would likely then allow the patients to take less of other
 kinds of medications they're currently taking. >> what benefits does alcis
 offer your patients that they haven't had before 0 >> we're always talking
 about new or different medicines, but by and large, these are all medications
 that have some significant risks, some significant side effects, and i think
 patients are very leery in trying them. If i can provide them with a safe
 alternative, like alcis, it's my duty to do so. >> alcis is amazing. >> it's
 given me back the ability to do the things that i like to do. >> alcis is a way
 get back into the game. >> alcis is... For me, a miracle. >> if you follow the
 news, you probably know all about cox-2 inhibitors. They were extremely popular
 government regulatory agencies and physicians alerted us to their serious risk
 of heart attack and stroke. >> medicines that we previously did not expect to
 have any problems are now, you know, being hailed as having significant
 problems. I think patients are gonna become more and more wary of me giving
 them a different pill. To be able to give a topical like alcis that's gonna be
 effective and that isn't gonna have any drug interactions is a huge advantage.
 >> speaking of the side effects of prescription drugs, listen to this. "tell
 your doctor if you have fluid retention, kidney or liver problems. In rare
 cases, serious stomach problems such as g.i. Bleeding can occur without
 warning. The most common side effects in clinical trials were indigestion,
 diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting." with alcis, you don't have to worry
 about that. It's available without a prescription, it's safe, it won't
 interfere with any other treatment you're using, and it will relieve your pain.
 it's time to meet joyce. She has a drawer full of expensive ointments that she
 used a few times but then stopped because they were more unpleasant than
 helpful. Sound familiar 0 she tried practically everything before she
 discovered that, for her, alcis is freedom. >> alcis has changed my life
 because it's cha... It's made me be able to be me. It's made it... Me not have
 to think about pain all the time. I was first diagnosed with arthritis in 1982
 , and it, it was pretty full-blown onset, so it changed my whole life. All of
 my life, i've made all my clothes and my children's clothes, but when the
 arthritis got so bad i couldn't sew anymore... That really... It was like a
 piece missing out of my life, not being able to sew. When you hurt bad enough,
 you're gonna try anything. Alcis feels like... It doesn't feel like medicine,
 it feels like i'm just putting on this very elegant hand cream or something. So
 feels good, and then it helps. 1982 laughs 1982 it's almost like taking a deep
 breath when it starts to work, and it's like... 1982 exhales 1982 sigh, back to
 well, that's just extraordinary. If i could use one word to describe what it
 means to me, it would be "freedom." because of alcis, i can sew again. And i
 spend a lot of my time now forgetting pain. I like that. Then, then i get to be
 again. >> are you one of the 70 million americans like joyce who have arthritis
 now you can become one of the growing number of people who have finally found
 relief with alcis. >> dr. Keller: most of the creams that are on the market
 that don't smell good, that people don't really like to use, contain what are
 called counterirritants. These are irritating, just as their title says.
 they're irritating the skin and they confuse the perception of pain without
 actually eliminating the pain. Alcis doesn't burn, it doesn't confuse the
 nervous system, it goes directly to the pain and starts to work. >> i don't
 like the hot experiences, i don't like the freezing cold experiences. >> i've
 tried everything, from creams, patches, the liquid heat stuff where it feels
 like your skin's about to be, you know, is on fire. But alcis... Perfect. >> i
 was surprised 'cause it didn't smell medicated but it actually did the work. >>
 has a fresh, beautiful fragrance and... The best part is it works. >> once you
 try it, you will know that it's incredibly effective. >> i mean, i can
 wholeheartedly endorse it because of what it's been... What it's done for me,
 what it's enabled me to do. >> just try it. Measure it and see if it helps you.
 would surely hope it helps other people like it helps me. >> i'm a very
 conservative doctor and i actually take... I think i take very good care of my
 patients and i would not expose them to something that i personally didn't
 think was safe, effective and likely to help them in the long run. And so, when
 had the opportunity to try alcis, it was everything i was looking for in a pain

 away to nonarm side to right hand hitters 0 one of the hardest pitches when you
 getting ready in spring training when you are ready you can execute that pitch
 and he had it. The split was sharp, late. The breaking ball was there. At times
 thought it was a little flat but still executed at a big league level. He will
 be fine when he comes back. The thing we can watch for is after three or four
 starts will he go through a dead arm period. >> going for the twins the young

 split was sharp, late. The breaking ball was there. At times i thought it was a

 but donovan is the man this team has to fend on and they couldn't depend on
 him. >> well, yes and no. It would be too easy to blame it all on him. I
 mentioned early on that some of the players didn't perform well before the
 first cup, marcus beasley was one of them. This year, kind of played out of
 position, played on the right side, midfield, i think that's part of the reason
 bruce arena felt that maybe he can use him there. I feel it was a mistake. I
 think that marcus beasley should have played on the left-hand side. Obviously,
 dempster has proven to us how good a player he can be. This is one player for
 me that rally the pressure never really got to him. He just went out with
 inexperience and played very well. >> but you have to admit, marcus beasley did
 job today. He was on the left-hand side, set up a perfect goal. I know that
 dempster took his goal with a lot of 1200 1200 dempsey took his goal with a lot
 confidence. This guy doesn't have much international experience and the way he
 finished it off was a thing of beauty. He hit it a ton. >> but we didn't play
 like this team is used to. There was a lot of cheerleading before the world cup
 of what happened four years ago. We were virtually unknowns four years ago.
 people are coming at us with speed. All of those teams have plenty of speed.
 the czech republic showed us how quick and good they can be with the ball and
 we just 1200 1200 you know, we just ran with the ball a little bit, didn't move
 quickly much of, and certainly i mean, you know, i look at landon donovan,-- >>
 were times today that he looked like he was crawling compared to the ghanians.
 they had a lot of team speed, broke very well with the ball, you were very
 comfortable with the ball, and that's the key thing, to fit the run in stride
 with the ball. >> all right. Guys, much to discuss including the future of
 u.s.a. Soccer. When we come back, bruce arena will 1200 1200 we'll hear from
 him, his postgame remarks as team u.s.a. Is done. A controversial call did not
 help the cause. Stay with us. Unlocked the doors when her dress and keys were
 inside. Got an e-mail from her car. Contacted help when his son stopped
 breathing. Helped find his dream car after it was stolen. Made a call even when
 cell phone couldn't. >> team u.s.a. And ghana, late first half, stoppage time,
 if you're just joining us, onyewu called for the penalty, controversial call,
 stephen appiah with a chance on a penalty kick, as a result of this penalty and
 the game tied at 1 -1 , appiah is able to convert on the penalty kick. It puts
 ghana up 2 -1 at the half and that turns out to be the final score, as team
 u.s.a. Is eliminated. More now from the men who called the game, dave o'brien
 and marcello balboa. >> there was that glimmer of hope when clint dempsey got
 on the run, got a service from beasley in the first half, stuck it in the back
 of the net, u.s.a. Had tied it at 1 -1 for that free thing moment it looked
 like the u.s.a.'s dreams just mitt come true. Today just not meant to be. What
 went wrong out here -1 >> everything went wrong. The players didn't have enough
 i think the coaching, the tactical plan, the scouting, i think everything was
 off. Just not enough energy. You're putting players out of position. You're
 supposed to play players where they're comfortable they play their best. You
 hate to say it but langdon donovan didn't show up, damarcus beasley didn't show
 and in 2002 , those guys stood at the plate and carried the team. Them time
 they didn't stand up and play where they're going home. >> when bruce arena
 tries to put the pieces together in a first-round exit, where does he start
 2002 >> they have to first sit down and think, does bruce arena keep his job.
 you have to look at a situation, the coach that's been around for a long time,
 demotivate his players, did he put the best players out on the field 2002
 that's one. That's where u.s. Soccer has to go first. Evaluate the bruce arena
 situation and then you know what 2002 the players have to look at themselves
 and say you can only blame the coach for half, the players have to take the
 responsibility for the other half. They have to realize they didn't come out
 and play this tournament, they're going home. U.s. Soccer has a lot to redo. >>
 don't think anybody understood just how good ghana is, as they move on with
 italy out of a very tough group, and the united states is going home, i'm dave
 o'brien, let's go back to the studio. >> guys, thank you very much. When we
 come back, we will hear from bruce arena on his team's elimination, the tough
 call there late in the first half led to the penalty kick. Ghana moving on,
 team u.s.a. Going home. We're back with more after this. >> and we're back.
 world cup finishes 2002 2002 worst world cup finishes all-time, and this is on
 the list, the 2006 , 1991 the worst, 1998 not good either. 1934 and then the 0
 -2 -1 mark that was just concluded here in 2006 back in the studio, rejoined by
 guests, and guys, we want to talk now about the future of u.s.a. Soccer. Tommy,
 first, where do they go from here 2006 >> well, i think there's 2006 2006 the
 future is very bright for them. I have absolutely no problems with what bruce
 arena has done. I think he's brought a lot to the table, i think he's done a
 lot for this team. Brought a lot of players on, he's made sure that every
 player has had an opportunity to get some international play. I think he's done
 all, seen it all. I don't think he wants to keep the job any longer, maybe he
 will prove me wrong but i think he will move on and but that's just may take on
 i have nothing against arena. I think arena has done a magnificent job for u.s.
 and whatever he gets, he deserves, let me tell you. >> i think he stays. There
 will be questions, of course. One do we stay with bruce arena or go with a
 foreign coach 2006 absolutely stay with an american coach. There are plenty. I
 don't know if it will be bruce arena, whenever it may be but i think there are
 plenty of coaches that understand the mentality of the players here. That is
 very important. Also the new president, if he's going to make a change, perhaps
 is the time. I do believe bruce arena, if he wants to, he should stay here as
 the coach again. >> i think bruce stays mainly because i don't know if he has a
 job offer right now. And the man likes to work and he wants to work, and the
 boynton is this 2006 2006 we might need another coach whose advance would
 happen under bruce arena. Just like bruce arena took over from his predecessor
 and took it to another step, maybe it's another foreign coach but the key is
 this, if you make that move and do decide to move away, agree to disagree with
 bruce arena and have him leave out the door, you better have someone in there
 who has legit credentials and can take it to the next level. >> in that
 mentality, there would be nothing wrong with bringing in a new mentality. I
 mean, the u.s. Have had this mentality now for a number of years so what's
 wrong with bringing in somebody that has new ideas, can implement new ideas
 2006 now that the talent is there, it's a case of maybe getting a little
 different approach. I mean, everybody saying did he play the right players, did
 have the right approach 2006 hey, it's time for a new approach. >> the new
 approach could be-- obviously, he's a coach that has been here for eight years,
 a long time in the world of soccer. So we'll mention that, do we need fresh air
 but i do think that at this point i don't see another candidate, american
 candidate that's ready. Perhaps ziggy schmidt but people will ask, so if it's a
 coach, the decision should be made very quickly, perhaps because a lot of the
 coaches will lose their jobs after this world cup, so there will be plenty of
 them available. >> give you one name-- >> kirosh was here before. He coached in
 with the so-called metro stars, now the red bull, so he has experience of this
 country, plus the fact that he brought on young players. He did a fantastic job
 portugal, he brought on under 21 players, he brought on under 23 players, won
 two world championships. He knows how to handle young players, that to me is
 the key. >> let's hear from arena now, his comments after the 2 -1 loss, mainly
 on the controversial call at the end of the first half. >> we worked real hard
 to get back into the game, and very disappointed on the judgment of our referee
 that penalty kick call, and putting our team behind at half and having to chase
 game for the second half, and i would have liked to have come out, halftime
 meeting and have a chance to really make it a game and win that game, because i
 we were in good position at the time. The call was a big call in the game.
 having said that, we could have been better with our opportunities in the
 second half to get some goals- >> and you were forced to change claudio reyna
 at halftime. How is he and how did that affect the shape of the team -1 >>
 didn't affect our shape. Did a good job coming in for claudio, injuries are
 part of the game. >> and finally, you went for it, you brought on johnson the
 attack, thought maybe he would-- >> yeah, at that point, obviously, ghana in
 the second half was very intent on setting the team back. The call for the
 penalty is big so they can hit back and hit their spots to counter, and they
 did that. >> so bruce arena's team is done for the world cup and as you guys
 just discussed, his future very much in doubt. In the meantime, we'll check in
 with the -1 -1 for the perspective on the world cup studio crew joining us with
 thoughts. >> when the united states looks back on its opportunity in this world
 it might be looking at it as an opportunity lost, not only from the grand
 perspective of building on the quarterfinal run in 2002 , but particularly in
 this game, an opportunity to move out, just couldn't make the plays they needed
 julie. >> that will be the big question. A lot of people came on, were watching
 world cup. Are the united states good enough to actually get into the second
 round 2002 do they have the players. I think they do, the problem is that we
 only saw the big names step up in spurts. You see brian mcbride occasionally.
 you see damarcus beasley occasionally. You don't see them consistently enough
 and you can't get out of the first round unless your players, who have the
 potential to be good, show up, and langdon donovan, nonexistent, which is
 unfortunate for the united states, when you have a playmaker that just doesn't
 come. >> i'll defend the players. I'm going to go after the coach. I think that
 managerial decisions made by bruce arena put these guys in a bad spot. I don't
 think they ever figured out that in a world cup, the ball does turn over. They
 worked out so hard on figuring out what to do defensively that once they got
 the ball, they forgot completely what they were supposed to do. In wourls it
 opens up and that's the way 2002 2002 in world cups it opens up and that's the
 way the game is played. The united states, bruce arena was the problem and it's
 heck of a lot easier to replace one guy than it is the others. >> you think
 it's time to make a change 2002 >> i believe if that's the kind of team we're
 going to throw out there, we're better than that, time to get rid of the coach.
 the world cup is up for bruce arena and the united states this year. >> all
 right. Guys, thank you very much. Want to bring up the topic here about
 preparation for international competition when it comes to u.s.a. Players.
 should the u.s.a. Now have more players playing internationally 2002 is the mls
 a lot of these guys enough of a preparation 2002 >> w here's the biggest
 difference. It's training day in and day out, and that's what you don't get in
 major league soccer. These guys need to learn to be pros, play for your
 position every day. It's not so much the big games or the championships, the
 semifinals, those are great but i think to really improve, it's all about
 competing every day at the top flight level. Maybe as major league soccer in a
 couple of years but certainly more players need to put themselves in that
 environment to improve. >> i think the case is if you're good enough, the big
 teams will come looking for you, so you have to become good enough to get to
 the next level or to be signed by somebody else. You know,ibility take excuses
 that the players on the field had enough to do it and i don't think this is a
 big knock on u.s. Soccer. The fact that the u.s. Got to the world cup finals
 was great and they didn't wear there, the olympics they didn't win there,
 soccer 2002 2002 hockey and basketball, didn't win there. So certainly soccer,
 just get young players, improve them. >> the core of this team should play
 abroad but the big thing is expectations. It would be irresponsible for us to
 think given that group before the world cup that we were going to easily go
 through it and we cheer a little bit, had our pompoms out and what happened was
 did it have to be this way 2002 no, we could have pulled another one perhaps
 today if it wasn't for that call but we still didn't play well when it mattered
 the first game was really the killer, and that's the bottom line. You lose that
 game, and chances are you're going to be out. >> reality bites. Anybody who is
 watching espnews, i keep telling people how good ghana were. Ghana are a very
 good team. This was a very well coached side, that is a side that has mike,
 probably the best holding midfielder in this, and not many teams can say he
 they have good players like that. Appiah was a good player. To watch them off
 was very foolish in the first place but i think the u.s. Did fine. >> i think
 the one thing we learned is this, it's not how you finish, it's how you start
 and the u.s. Never recovered from the devastating defeat to the czech republic.

 to be some coverage here and unfortunately there is not much he could have done
 i think they trust him so much, they left him without any support and paid
 price. Back to the czech republic. >> it was time for them to step up. Just
 came out and got on. Big hero. He nods it home. This is exactly what team
 u.s.a. Wanted as italy doing what it had to do, but would team u.s.a. Do what
 it had to do in we, looking good here. I didn't work on often with you this is
 probably bev sequence donovan running off mcbride. The offense struggling and
 to marcus marcus beazley. Early ball across, great finish by dempsey. >> very,
 very similar one. This one perhaps closer, but what a goal, best u.s. Player in
 tournament. He came into the tournament and played, didn't worry about
 anything. And this is just a tremendous finish here. You can see him size up
 the situation. >> czech republic has been tossed after this. He already has a
 yellow card and is now tossed, czech republic is down rest of match. Gucci on
 yaywu. >> but not once but twice failed to clear. He ones header and till gets
 called. They continue to put themselves in a bad situation. Sets it up for
 stevens, able to convertment he dws tough on the opposite side. >> nothing
 controversial for me. Just a bad call made by one of the best referees there
 world. Just no reason to call that, regardless of what situation is, but this
 is just bad. 2 -1 down at the half. Italy and the czech republic with the
 czeches trying to pull even here. A really good game. Bouncing around,
 everything but the the finish. Wasn't going to do it today. >> second half,
 brian mcbride. Check it out again. >> those are situations you have to putt
 away in a tight game. He makes a great effort but a little bit unlucky and his
 wood work. >> the header and he rises perfectly to it. He just needs to get it
 down a little bit. I was there and he just knocked it over top. Vindication but
 didn't come. >> team u.s.a. Are unable to put a goal on board. Meantime 1 0
 italy. All he does is score goals. Sells it like he is to pass i and i tians,
 you know, they've won two very dwood games in this group against a tough guy.
 italy doing... >> why do you think i picked up winners 0 and they had all
 motivation. They did no want to see brazil in the round >> all over for team
 u.s.a. Three shots on goal total in their three game torn am. They go down-one.
 and italy move on. Team u.s.a. And czech republic go home. >> what are your
 thoughts for game 0 >> strange game. We hi post. Pee have a few chances. I mean
 are so many different things that go on in this game that we stuck together,
 tried to push forward, if we had just gotten that second goal, with you no
 would have could have or should haves. >> what did you call that goal 0 >> i
 doan know. I rarely ever see something like that called. They wrn even using
 their arms, so halftime and momentum and, you know, still came out and press
 forward. And created a lo of chances and ice just unfortunate. >> what do you
 take away from this experience 0 >> we, you know, this has been great. I've
 enjoyed it. >> team u.s.a. Losing to ghana two had one out of world cup.
 question, where does team u.s.a. Go from here 0 >> i think there is no disgrace
 being in the world cup times and losing. There has to be a winner and loser all
 i think the expectations were too high because of of what the u.s. Achieved in
 last world cup. I think it's back to drawing board. Get a few more players.
 they need somebody in mid-field that can create thank you so much and move of
 all, they have to develop a striker, somebody who can putt ball in back of net.
 something u.s. Has not done very well many >> everybody thought we had arrived
 but we have not. There are a lo of countries trying to do same thing and can't
 do i. We have a long way to go but we are getting better >> absolutely. >> the
 league is not going to go away. U.s. Soccer is still ascending to higher
 heights but the question will be how will they respond inmaterially 0 will they
 the great direction they're in 0 try to shake things up, overturn the apple
 cart 0 we should not be disappointed. Almost00 teams start the process. Only 32
 to germany. You think about the czech psh also going home. There are some good
 teams not going on. U.s. Soccer still very much is going forward. When we come

 opinion -1 >> well, i think we'd all agree it wasn't a good call. To have that
 call in the 47 th minute after our teamworked so hard to get back in the game
 is difficult much i feel sorry for our team. We played a very good game
 certainly at fought in the second half for not doing better with the tactic
 play and not getting goal, but to be in a position to have to chase the game on
 call was kind of remarkable in a game at this level. It's a big call, by the
 way, if you haven't figured that out. That was a big part of the game. We had
 control of the game. We go into halftime down a goal. But those things happen.
 they happen a lot to our team, without those things happen and we had chances
 in the second half but we'll put in an awkward position to have to go against
 the team. It is disappointing. Knowing that a win gets us into the next round
 would have been great, and it's tough. It's a tough one to deal with. >> did
 you manage to have any conversation with the referee about it afterwards 47 >>
 shook his hand afterwards; you know. Have you ever heard any referee say they
 made a bad call 47 >> yeah, he's a man that has done a lot of good matches. He
 is obviously a quality referee, and, you know, referees have good days, and
 referees have bad days. Players have good days and bad days. Same with coaches.
 much of his comments directed at that penalty call stopped time the first half.
 that the entire story 47 >> you need a break, some balance and love if you are
 going to advance and what happened they did not put themselves in a position to
 their own luck. They left it to dr. Marcus mirk. That's the soft softest. If he
 that ball ball-- lobs that ball into the second tier the stadium, i don't think
 are having this conversation. >> obviously this game but i think we left it
 late and we have to talk about what happened in the first game against the
 czech republic because that's where we lost game. And to lose it... We all knew
 important he is to the team. To give up a goal in the fourth or fifth minute,
 we didn't worry. I think that was a big problem because even if he lost that
 game 1 1 nil, italy looks different. Maybe we have to do more. But at the end
 of the day, it was a tough group >> it was a very tough group but we've got to
 give some credit. We haven't given credit to the man who stepped up and took
 the penalty kick. P no question about it he took it well. There is a lot of
 pressure this this and a lot of press are on bruce arena. Bruce said coaches
 and referee didn't have a good day. The penalty kick was the story but not
 whole reason. >> as it is, controversy or not, over for team u.s.a. They had to
 today. They cannot as they go down in ghana 2 -1 p more discussion ahead as
 team u.s.a. And ghana finish upbury losing by one. Stay us -1 romantic music -1

 we continue. Please stay with us. >> hi everyonement bill pidto with breaking
 news. Larry brown has been fired as head coach of the new york knicks after an
 is as truss one-year stint with a record of 23 -59 , worst record for brown.
 isaiah thomas will assume coaching duties. He had one year left on his contract
 there are 40000000 will we don't have the terms the buyout. He came to the the
 knicks one year after leading the pistons to the finals. Management became
 upset after brown criticized his players in public. We are now joined on the
 phone by knicks beat writer rick burman who joins us via the espn mobile. Larry
 owed in the neighborhood of 40000000 40000000 how is money issue resolved
 40000000 >> it is going to be complicated. I really can't get into specifics
 right now. But it is going to be a dispute. It is going to be very ugly and he
 was fired but it is going to be a dispute on how much money larry gets and it
 has not been determined yet. >> so you are saying the knicks went ahead and
 fired hard-line without having a monetary settlement. But if they are
 contractually obligated to pay him in the neighborhood of that 40000000 40
 million figure, how can they get away with paying him left less in >> i don't
 want to get into specifications but that's where the dispute will come into
 play. The knicks obviously very upset with larry's performance this year, and
 they feel differently p larry on that issue. >> what about the timeline here 40
 know we saw larry brown at the pre-draft workouts for the rookies when the
 situation look like it was going to work out but he continued to go along as
 coach even though it looked like he was going to be done in that position. Why
 is today the day the knicks made that announcement 40 >> today was the last day
 the pre-draft workouts. Larry drafted more than a dodds of them and today was
 the last day. That's probably the best timing. They had larry do the workouts.
 he's great with kids in terms of of giving them prevast workouts. He lael works
 well and i think owen wanted larry to suffer a little bit. Very bitter at what
 larry did this season and they met for an hour. I'm told that don went this the
 with an open mind, wan to see what was going to change. But they did not think
 the the meeting went well at all. They probably met at 8 :00 or eight clr 15 in
 morning and they cannot reach an equitable decision so far. This is day 40
 since we wrote the story. >> marc, if you'll hang on, we'll read a statement
 released by president and chairman of the knicks, james dolan. He said: what
 was the single biggest issue that created this rip 40 >> there were a number
 them. Larry can be unbearable when i comes to wanting roster moves and he so
 many friends along lead, talking to them about trades, and it sort of ewe
 searching isaiah's responsibilities. And they couldn't work that way anymore. P
 wants to be coach and the g.m. He didn't have that title in philadelphia but
 that's what he really was. And as many people predicted, when i get hired,
 isaiah wants a not are control. It is a terrible marriage from givening
 understood so many people predicted i anyway. >> so now into steps of isaiah
 thomas as coach and retain is hostage. He is man considered to have with this
 team. How is he going to be able to coach them 40 >> well, i think the nishgs
 want to run show. I eye-- i sighia believes in this roster. He brought all
 these guys into new york. Larry never believed in this rosserment isaiah is
 going to come in with a totally different attitude. He won't be ripping players
 the pret, and that in itself it as a very talented roster they believe that
 with a playoff game and with a weather climate, better team around, they think
 with minimal changes isaiah they're miserable. They haver reason and every
 right to can him. Everybody wants to see isaiah canned now butt will until you
 get a coach that he believes is right person for roster, you know, as michael
 jordan and larry hooking up. They're pretty good friends and they have the unc
 ties. Larry had a lot of ties to charlotte, his mother who is 101 lives there.
 his two daughters from his first marriage live there it might be a nice fit but
 is more concerned with the monetary set lem right now. >> marc berman from the
 "new york post," thank you very much. More on the larry brown situation on in
 the afternoon. In the meantime we'll continue to talk about world cup soccer.
 team u.s.a. Is done. We're back at you after a break. We'll take a look at the

 as we take a look. As the day began. Czeches here in the 12 th minute attacking
 nice move. He was running things for the czech republic. Eight saves for
 beaufant. Scoreless key play. He loses the ball, hurts the knee and he makes it
 0 and guys, tough play there's got t be some coverage here. They just left
 without any support and they paid the price. This is exactly what team u.s.a.
 wanted as italy doing what it had to do, but would team u.s.a. Do what it had
 to do in we, looking good here. I didn't work on often with you this is
 probably bev sequence this is probably a sequence donovan running off mcbride.
 the offense struggling and to marcus beazley. Early ball across, great finish
 by dempsey. >> very, very similar one. This one perhaps closer, but what a
 goal, best u.s. Player in the tournament. He came into the tournament and
 played, didn't worry about anything. And this is just a tremendous finish here.
 can see him size up the situation. He played the ball exactly where dempsey
 needed itment and back at the czech republic. 0 he has been tossedment >> czech

 with paying him less 40 >> i don't want to get into specifications but that's
 where the dispute will come into play. The knicks obviously very upset with
 larry's performance this year, and they feel differently than larry on that
 issue. >> what about the timeline here 40 we know we saw larry brown at the
 pre-draft workouts for the rookies when the situation look like it was going to
 out but he continued to go along as coach even though it looked like he was
 going to be done in that position. Why is today the day the knicks made that
 announcement 40 >> today was the last day of the pre-draft workouts. Larry
 drafted more than a dodds of them and today was the last day. That's probably
 the best timing. They had larry do the workouts. He's great with kids in terms
 of of giving them prevast workouts. He lael works them well and i think owen
 wanted larry to suffer a little bit. Very bitter at what larry did this season
 and they met for an hour. I'm told that don went this the meeting with an open
 mind, wan to see what was going to change. But they did not think the the
 meeting went well at all. They probably met at 8 :00 or eight clr 15 in the
 morning and they cannot reach an equitable decision to come back so far. This
 is day 40 since we wrote the story. >> marc, if you'll hang on, we'll read a
 statement released by president and chairman of the knicks, james dolan. He
 said: what was the single he said: what was the single biggest issue that
 created this rip 40 >> there were a number them. Larry can be unbearable when i
 can be unbearable when it comes to wanting roster moves and he so many friends
 along lead, talking to them about trades, and it sort of ewe trades, and it
 sort of isaiah's responsibilities. And they couldn't work that way anymore.
 larry wants to be coach and the g.m. He didn't have that title in philadelphia
 but that's what he really was. And as many people predicted, when i get hired,
 isaiah wants a not are control. It is a terrible marriage from givening
 understood so many people predicted i anyway. Thomas as coach. He is man
 considered to have with this team. How is he going to be able to >> well, i
 think the knicks want to run show. Issaiah believes in this roster. He brought
 all these guys into new york. Larry never believed in this rosserment isaiah is
 to isaiah is going to come in with a totally different attitude. He won't be
 ripping players in the pret, and that in itself it as a very talented roster
 they believe that with a playoff game and with a weather climate, better team
 around, they think with minimal changes isaiah they're miserable. They have
 every reason and every right to can him. Canned now but will until you get a
 coach that he believes is right person for roster, you know, as michael jordan
 and larry hooking up. They're pretty good friends and they have the unc ties.
 larry had a lot of ties to charlotte, his mother who is 101 lives there. His
 two daughters from his first marriage live there it might be settlement right
 now. That's going to be biggest thing on his mind. >> marc berman from the "new
 post," thank you very much. More on the larry brown situation on in the
 afternoon. In the meantime we'll continue to talk about world cup soccer. Team

 elimination the world cup. If you are just joining us, it is over for team
 u.s.a. We have highlights of of that game as well as the czech republic italy
 game. >> i think they trust him so much, they left him without any support and
 paid price. Back to the czech republic. >> it was time for them to step up.
 just came out and got on. Big hero. He nods it home. This is exactly what team
 u.s.a. Wanted as italy doing what it had to do, but would team u.s.a. Do what
 it had to do in we, looking good here. I didn't work on often with you this is
 probably bev sequence donovan running off mcbride. The offense struggling and
 to marcus beazley. Early ball across, great finish by dempsey. >> very, very
 similar one. This one perhaps closer, but what a goal, best u.s. Player in the
 route one tactic didn't work on often with you this is probably bev sequence
 donovan running off mcbride. The offense struggling and to marcus beazley.
 early ball across, great finish by dempsey. >> very, very similar one. This one
 closer, but what a goal, best u.s. Player in the tournament. He came into the
 tournament and played, didn't worry about anything. And this is just a
 tremendous finish here. You can see him size up the situation. >> czech
 republic has been tossed after this. He already has a yellow card and is now
 tossed, czech republic is down rest of match. Gucci on yaywu. >> but not once
 but twice failed to clear. He ones header and till gets called. They continue
 to put themselves in a bad situation. Sets it up for stevens, able to
 convertment he dws tough on the opposite side. >> nothing controversial for me.
 a bad call made by one of the best referees there world. Just no reason to call
 regardless of what situation is, but this is just bad. 2 -1 down at the half.
 italy and the czech republic with the czeches trying to pull even here. A
 really good game. Bouncing around, everything but the the finish. Wasn't going
 to do it today. >> second half, brian mcbride. Check it out again. >> those are
 you have to putt away in a tight game. He makes a great effort but a little bit
 and his wood work. >> the header and he rises perfectly to it. He just needs to
 it down a little bit. I was there and he just knocked it over top. Vindication
 but it didn't come. >> team u.s.a. Are unable to put a goal on board. Meantime
 1 0 italy. All he does is score goals. Sells it like he is to pass i and i
 tians, you know, they've won two very dwood games in this group against a tough
 italy doing... >> why do you think i picked up winners 0 and they had all
 motivation. They did no want to see brazil in the round >> all over for team
 u.s.a. Three shots on goal total in their three game torn am. They go down-one.
 and italy move on. Team u.s.a. And czech republic go home. >> what are your
 thoughts for game 0 >> strange game. We hi post. Pee have a few chances. I mean
 are so many different things that go on in this game that we stuck together,
 tried to push forward, if we had just gotten that second goal, with you no
 would have could have or should haves. >> what did you call that goal 0 >> i
 doan know. I rarely ever see something like that called. They wrn even using
 their arms, so halftime and momentum and, you know, still came out and press
 forward. And created a lo of chances and ice just unfortunate. >> what do you
 take away from this experience 0 >> we, you know, this has been great. I've
 enjoyed it. >> team u.s.a. Losing to ghana two had one out of world cup.
 question, where does team u.s.a. Go from here 0 >> i think there is no disgrace
 being in the world cup times and losing. There has to be a winner and loser all
 i think the expectations were too high because of of what the u.s. Achieved in
 last world cup. I think it's back to drawing board. Get a few more players.
 they need somebody in mid-field that can create thank you so much and move of
 all, they have to develop a striker, somebody
