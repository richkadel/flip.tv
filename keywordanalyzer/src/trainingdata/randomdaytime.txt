ELIMIDATE 
HA HA HA!
>> ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
EVERYBODY'S BEEN GREAT.
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.
ALL YOU GIRLS ARE VERY
COMPETITIVE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
THERE'S JUST ONE PERSON THAT
THE ONLY TIME WE REALLY HAD A
SPARK WAS WHEN YOU SCRAPPED.
THAT'S ABOUT IT.
SO, UNFORTUNATELY, LEAH, I'M
SORRY. I GOT TO LET YOU GO.
>> OK. THANKS.
>> BEEN GREAT KNOWING YOU.
>> THANKS.
>> BYE, LEAH.
>> BYE, LEAH.
>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY HE
CUT ME. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK WE
HAD AN INITIAL, LIKE, SPARK
LIKE HE SAID, SO...IF HE WANTS
THOSE OTHER GIRLS, IT'S FINE.
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE AWAY FROM
SAMANTHA. SHE'S REALLY INTENSE,
REALLY FAKE, AND TOTALLY NOT
COOL.
>> FOR ROUND TWO, I DECIDED
TO CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
WE CHANGED OUR CLOTHES, WE
HEADED OVER TO BAJA BEACH CLUB.
AS SOON AS I SAW THOSE GIRLS IN
THEIR HOT OUTFITS, I WANTED TO
GET RIGHT ON THE DANCE FLOOR
AND GET GOING.
>> WE'RE ON THE DANCE FLOOR, AND
BONNIE GRABS JOHN AND STARTS
MAKING OUT WITH HIM. I THINK
SHE'S A SLUT. CAPITAL "S."
>> SAMANTHA, YOU'RE PUSHING
BONNIE LIKE THAT, I MEAN, COME
ON NOW. JUST GET YOUR FREAK ON
WITH ME. WORRY ABOUT HER LATER.
>> NEVER MISSIN' A SPOT,
CARESSING YOUR BACK, WE'RE
CHEST TO CHEST, YOU'RE KISSIN'
ON MY FRECKLES, I NIBBLED AROUND
YOUR EAR BEFORE I SUCK UP ON
YOUR NECK, OH, MONEY 
>> JOHN'S CHEST TASTED A LITTLE
SALTY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE
DANCING. BUT...
IT WAS A SWEET SALTY.
>> NEVER LETTING A KITTY-CAT
GET PAST ME WITHOUT PICKIN' IT
UP, TEASIN' IT, TAKIN' IT HOME
AND PLEASIN' IT 
>> CHRISTINE, YOU'RE PUTTING
YOUR TONGUE IN MY EAR. WAY OUTTA
LEFT FIELD, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S FRONT AND CENTER FOR ME.
IT WAS PRETTY HOT ON THE DANCE
FLOOR. WE HAD TO GO AND COOL
OFF. NOTHING BETTER TO COOL OFF
THAN SOME NICE DRINKS. WE GOT
HOT AND HEAVY. I MEAN, YOU
KISSED ME. THAT WAS GREAT.
WHAT DO YOU GIRLS THINK ABOUT
THAT?
>> I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA BE THE
FIRST ONE TO KISS YOU, JUST BY
HER ATTITUDE, HER WHOLE, YOU
KNOW, THE WAY SHE PUTS HERSELF
OUT THERE.
>> THE WAY I PUT MYSELF OUT
THERE? LOOK AT YOU.
>> THAT'S MY CLOTHES, NOT THE
WAY I ACT. IT'S A DIFFERENCE,
THE WAY YOU ACT AND THE WAY YOU
PORTRAY YOURSELF, AND IT'S
TOTALLY DIFFERENT. YOU'RE OUT
THERE DOING WHAT YOU SAY MY
CLOTHES SAY. MY CLOTHES CAN SAY
IT. I'M NOT ACTING LIKE IT.
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY
FORWARD...BUT YOU KNOW, IT WAS
IN THE MOMENT, I GUESS.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK? I HAVEN'T
HEARD MUCH FROM YOU. COME ON
OUT. TELL IT LIKE IT IS RIGHT
NOW. THIS IS THE CHANCE.
>> YES. ALL RIGHT, WELL, SHE'S
VERY VERBAL, WHICH, I MEAN, CAN
BE A GOOD THING. SHE LIKES TO
SPEAK HER MIND, WHICH IS GREAT.
BONNIE HERE, ALL OVER...YOU
KNOW, I MEAN, THAT MIGHT BE A
LITTLE MUCH ON OUR FIRST DATE.
>> THANK YOU!
>> THEY'RE GANGING UP HERE.
>> I MEAN, I ENJOYED IT, AND I
DON'T REGRET IT, SO...
>> SHE TRIES TO SEEM INNOCENT,
BUT SHE'S NOT.
AND SHE'S LIKE...FROM THE SECOND
SHE MEETS YOU. SHE'S LIKE THAT
WITH EVERYBODY.
>> OBVIOUSLY, I'M WORTH HOLDING
ONTO. I DATED THE SAME GUY FOR 6
YEARS.
>> I HAD A GUY FOR 10 YEARS.
WHAT'S THAT? I BEAT YOU.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS
THINKING.
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
LOOK AT YOUR FACE, FIRST OF ALL.
ALL THAT [BLEEP] ACNE THERE.
THAT'S [BLEEP] DISGUSTING.
GET A FACIAL, FIRST OF ALL.
SECOND OF ALL, THEY TOLD
YOU TO COME IN SOMETHING SEXY.
WHAT THE HELL IS SEXY ABOUT
THAT?
>> WHAT'S SEXY ABOUT THAT?
>> THIS IS A LITTLE TOO MUCH.
>> WHO WEARS SNOW BOOTS TO A
CLUB?
>> DON'T GET [BLEEP] 'CAUSE
YOU'RE ON ELIMIDATE. MEET ME IN
THE STREET. THAT'S STREET TALK.
>> HEY, I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT
YOU.
>> NOT ON ELIMIDATE. NOT ON
ELIMIDATE.
>> I'M NOT A FIGHTER.
>> SHE'S TOO FAKE. SHE'S SO
FAKE. YOU'RE VERY FAKE. I FEEL
IT. IT'S YOUR WHOLE AURA. EVEN
SHE FELT IT. IT'S YOUR AURA.
IT'S YOUR AURA. YOU GIVE IT OFF.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SHE SAID I
WAS FAKE.
>> SHE'S THINKING IT. I SEE THE
WAY SHE'S LOOKING AT ME. SHE
KNOWS.
>> OH, 'CAUSE YOU JUST KNOW
EVERYTHING.
>> YEAH, I'M [BLEEP] PSYCHIC.
I'M PSYCHIC, COUNTRY GIRL. I'M
PSYCHIC.
>> I'M THE SWEETEST GIRL THAT
YOU'LL EVER MEET, AND THIS GIRL
IS MEAN. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HER
PROBLEM WAS. SHE MUST HAVE NOT
BEEN LOVED AS A CHILD. LIKE, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS.
>> I AM NOT A HATER. EVERYBODY
THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS I AM NOT A
HATER. SHE'S JUST MAD 'CAUSE I'M
PRETTIER THAN HER AND MY CLOTHES
ARE BETTER THAN HERS.
>> ALL RIGHT, THIS DATE WAS
MINE. TODAY WAS MINE. IT WAS FOR
ME TO GET TO KNOW YOU AND HAVE
A GREAT TIME. I GOT TO KNOW YOU
ONCE, GO ON A SECOND DATE, WE
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE
MORE AFTER THAT. HOW WOULD THAT
NIGHT END?
>> IT WOULD GO WHEREVER WE WERE
FEELING IT. IF WE WERE FEELING
EACH OTHER, WE'D CONTINUE ON OUR
DATE, MAYBE GO OUT, HAVE SOME
DRINKS AND SEE WHERE THE NIGHT
LED US.
>> REALLY? OK.
>> AFTER THE DRINKS, WHATEVER
HAPPENS HAPPENS. IF WE GOT TO
KNOW EACH OTHER AND WERE FEELING
EACH OTHER, THERE'S NO LIMITS. I
MEAN, IF YOU'RE HANGING OUT
AND STARTING A RELATIONSHIP--
>> WELL, I HAVE LIMITS.
>> IF YOU'RE DATING A GUY, YOU
HAVE LIMITS? NO. YOU'RE GONNA BE
WITH THE GUY, RIGHT? I MEAN,
YOU'RE KISSING HIM--DO YOU EVEN
KNOW HIS NAME, AND YOU'RE
KISSING HIM?
>> I KNOW HIS NAME.
>> OK. AND YOU'RE KISSING HIM.
SO IF YOU'RE HANGING OUT, GOING
OUT, AND IF I BRING SOMEBODY--
>> I'M NOT GONNA SLEEP WITH HIM
ON A FIRST DATE.
>> I DIDN'T SAY I WAS GONNA
SLEEP WITH HIM ON THE FIRST
DATE.
>> YOU SAID NO LIMITS.
>> WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
FIRST DATE. IN GENERAL.
>> OK, SECOND DATE.
>> TALKING IN GENERAL.
>> WELL, I'M NOT GONNA SLEEP
WITH YOU UNTIL I'M IN LOVE WITH
YOU, SO...THAT'S SOMETHING
SPECIAL BETWEEN PEOPLE.
>> THAT'S COUNTRY.
>> I HAVE A LOT OF VALUES AND
MORALS--
>> SHE'S LYING! I DON'T CARE
WHAT SHE SAYS. SHE'S [BLEEP]!
YOU'RE LYING!
>> I KNOW WHO I AM.
>> YOU'RE A LIAR! THAT'S WHO YOU
ARE! YOU'RE A LIAR! L, L, L,
LIAR! I SEE--OH, MY GOD!
>> WHY AM I A LIAR?
>> BECAUSE SHE'S GONNA KISS YOU
THE SECOND SHE MEETS YOU, SO
SHE'S NNA REALLY SLEEP WITH
SOMEBODY WHEN SHE'S IN LOVE WITH
THEM? COME ON! GET THE [BLEEP]
OFF IT!
>> KISSING AND SLEEPING ARE
DIFFERENT.
>> TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS.
>> CHECK THIS OUT. I DON'T ACT
LIKE YOU. I'M NOT ON PEOPLE'S--
ON PEOPLE'S FACES. I SIT BACK--
>> YOU'RE NOT IN PEOPLE'S FACES?
YOU'RE IN MY FACE!
[OVERLAPPING ARGUMENT]
>> CHECK THIS OUT, I'LL BE IN
YOUR FACE AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SAY? NOTHING! [BLEEP] NOTHING!
YOU'RE A PUNK, THAT'S WHY!
I [BLEEP] DON'T LIKE HER. I
DON'T LIKE HER. I DON'T LIKE
HER. I DON'T LIKE HER.
>> YOU'RE RESERVED, HUH?
>> I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT WITH HER.
>> SO GET A [BLEEP] TWO BLACK
EYES AND A BROKEN NOSE. THAT'S
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HER.
>> I'M NOT GONNA HIT YOU. I'M
NOT THAT GIRL.
>> OK, WHO SAID I'M GONNA HIT
YOU, BUT YOU LET ME GET IN YOUR
FACE AND BE LIKE--
>> YOU STAND UP FOR YOURSELF? I
MEAN--
>> NO, SHE DOESN'T! SHE DOESN'T!
HE SAW IT! IF BONNIE'S GONNA
FIGHT WITH ME AND I WANNA TAKE
IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF FIST,
SHE'S SCARED. WHY YOU GONNA BE
SCARED IF YOU'RE TALKING ALL
THAT? I'LL KNOCK YOU OUT.
>> I DIDN'T NEED TO SEE SAMANTHA
GO AT BONNIE. I WANTED TO BREAK
IT UP, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I
GOTTA SEE WHO CAN FEND FOR
THEMSELVES.
>> COMING UP, WILL SAMANTHA BE
THE FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION?
>> I'M GONNA WIN BECAUSE I'M HOT
AND I GOT IT TOGETHER. I GOT MY
JOB. I GOT MY MONEY. AND...IF
SOMEBODY BRINGS IT TO ME, I WILL
FIGHT THEM. SO I AM NOT A PUNK.
AND THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA WIN.
>> ELIMIDATE.
ATE.
HA HA HA HA.
>> ALL RIGHT, LADIES, I'M GLAD
WE HAD A CHANCE TO SETTLE DOWN.
I MEAN--WHEW, BETWEEN THE
DANCING AND THE FIGHTING, THE
WORDS EXCHANGED, MY HEAD'S
SPINNING. I'M GLAD WE'VE LEVELED
OUT A LITTLE. NOW, YOU'RE VERY
OUTGOING. YOU'RE UP FRONT, BUT
YOU'RE RESERVED AT THE SAME
TIME. YOU--CRAZY. SPUNKY, YOU
KNOW? YOU GOT IT GOIN' ON. AND
YOU'RE REALLY RESERVED, YOU'RE
VERY LAID-BACK, AND I LIKE THAT
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I GOTTA LET
SOMEONE GO, AND I NEED YOU TO
OPEN UP AND YOU COULDN'T DO IT
FOR ME, SO...I GOTTA LET YOU GO,
ALL RIGHT, CHRISTINE?
>> OK. IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.
>> NICE MEETING YOU. TAKE CARE,
SWEETIE.
>> BYE, CHRISTINE.
>> HAVE FUN.
>> THANK YOU, SWEETIE.
>> I'M KIND OF GLAD TO BE OUT OF
THE CONFLICT. I WOULD HAVE
LIKED TO GET TO KNOW HIM, BUT,
YOU KNOW, THIS IS HOW IT
HAPPENS.
>> I PERSONALLY WOULD RATHER
HAVE SPENT THE NEXT ROUND WITH
CHRISTINE.
>> BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE SPENT
THE NEXT ROUND WITH HER, TOO, SO
THAT'S NOTHING. WE'VE ALREADY
ESTABLISHED THAT I DON'T LIKE
YOU.
>> I HOPE YOU TWO GIRLS HAVE A
GREAT TIME. JUST PLEASE DON'T
RIP EACH OTHER'S HEAD OFF.
HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH JOHN.
>> FOR ROUND THREE, WE STAYED
AT THE BAJA BEACH CLUB, WE GOT
OUR OWN PRIVATE LITTLE BOOTH.
THERE WAS A LOTTA HATE GOING
AROUND. I WANTED TO SETTLE DOWN
AND GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
LISTEN, I'M GLAD YOU LADIES HAVE
BEEN REAL COMPETITIVE. IT'S
WHAT'S LED YOU HERE. BUT WHAT
WOULD YOU DO FOR ME THAT BONNIE
CAN'T DO?
>> FIRST OF ALL, I'M A LITTLE
OLDER THAN HER AND PROBABLY HAVE
MY THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE
TOGETHER. SO IN ANY ASPECT, I
CAN PROBABLY DO MORE THAN HER.
I'M SURE. IN BED, IN HAVING FUN,
IN ANYTHING. I THINK I'M JUST
MORE FUN THAN HER.
>> YOU KISS ON THE FIRST DATE?
>> I KISS ON THE FIRST DATE.
YES, I DO.
>> WE'RE ON A FIRST DATE.
>> WE'RE ON A FIRST DATE. OH,
YOU WANT A KISS. ALL RIGHT.
>> YOU SEEM VERY--
>> GOTTA WIPE YOU.
SPARKLES.
>> SAMANTHA, YOU CALLED ME OUT
ON BEING A SLUT BECAUSE I KISSED
ON THE FIRST DATE, BUT, HONEY,
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.
>> A KISS IS A KISS. IF YOU
KISS, YOU KISS. WHATEVER.
>> WHAT'S THE ONE THING--I MEAN
THE ABSOLUTE ONE THING--THAT
SHINES ABOVE THE REST THAT WOULD
PUT YOU IN FRONT OF SAMANTHA
HERE?
>> THE THING THAT PUTS ME IN
FRONT OF SAMANTHA IS THAT I'M
NOT MEAN AND I GO AFTER WHAT I
WANT WITHOUT HAVING TO BE MEAN
AND ATTACK ANOTHER GIRL.
>> REALLY? OK.
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING MEAN,
'CAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST
ROUND, I HAD THREE OF THEM
ATTACKING ME. IF YOU REMEMBER.
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. WHAT
SEPARATES ME FROM HER IS FIRST
OF ALL, I'M HOTTER THAN HER. I
COULD LOOK--OFF THE BAT, YOU
KNOW, I KNOW, SHE KNOWS. I'M
HOTTER THAN HER. SECOND OF ALL,
SHE'S JUST FAKE. I JUST GET A
BAD IMPRESSION FROM HER. I DON'T
BELIEVE HER, YOU KNOW? I JUST
DON'T BELIEVE HER.
>> WHEN YOU SAY YOU FEEL A VIBE,
I MEAN, WHAT SORT OF VIBE? IS IT
CERTAIN WORDS? I MEAN, I KNOW
THE ACTIONS, BUT...
>> THE ACTIONS AND WHAT SHE SAYS
AND JUST HER WHOLE VIBE--JUST
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER.
>> SO WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE
ABOUT HER?
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHEN I GOT IN
HER FACE, I WOULD HAVE HAD HER
SAY SOMETHING BACK TO ME,
BECAUSE THE FACT THAT SHE
DIDN'T, I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR
HER 'CAUSE SHE CAN'T STAND UP
FOR HERSELF. FIRST OF ALL.
>> IF I HAD SAID SOMETHING, YOU
WOULD HAVE PUNCHED ME IN MY
FACE. YEAH, EXACTLY, SO I
WASN'T GONNA HAVE YOU PUNCH ME
IN MY FACE.
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T STAND UP FOR
YOURSELF. THAT'S THE WHOLE
THING. YOU'LL LET SOMEBODY
SAY WHATEVER ABOUT YOU?
>> I'M NOT HERE TO FIGHT WITH
YOU. I'M HERE FOR HIM.
>> OF COURSE, I'M HERE FOR HIM,
TOO, NO DOUBT. BUT YOU SEEM TO
FORGET THAT YOU STARTED WITH ME.
SEE, THEY FORGET THAT. THEY
FORGET. SHE FORGETS THAT SHE
STARTED WITH ME FIRST.
>> YOU STARTED WITH ALL OF US
FIRST. YOU WERE VERY FEISTY FROM
THE BEGINNING.
>> I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. YOU
STARTED WITH ME FIRST. BUT
IT'S OK.
>> SAMANTHA CAN BE MEANER THAN
ME. THAT'S ONE THING SHE CAN DO
BETTER THAN ME. DEFINITELY.
OTHER THAN THAT, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING SHE CAN DO
BETTER THAN ME.
>> BONNIE IS UGLY, A ZIT-HEAD,
UGLY FACE, UGLY CLOTHES, THINKS
SHE'S HOT, IS REALLY NOT. I
THINK I'M GONNA WIN IT. I KNOW
I'M GONNA WIN IT.
>> WHOSE AURA WILL JOHN CHOOSE?
THE FINAL CUT IS NEXT.
>> ELIMIDATE.

And now the Professional
Education Institute presents
a paid presentation of the
Carleton Sheets 20th
Anniversary celebration show.
Celebrating 20 years of success
with the Carleton
Sheets No Down Payment
Real Estate Home Study course.
A simple step-by-step home
study course anyone can use
to become
financially independent.
We've made more
in 2 years than I made
in my entire 11 year
engineering career.
It's a freedom.
It's a freedom to
whatever we want to do
when we want to do it.
We're talking about
early retirement all of that
and that's what
life is all about
just being able to live
life the way we want to live it.
(Announcer)
Carleton's No Down
Payment show now celebrating
its 20th anniversary
here in Hawaii
is the longest running
show of its kind
in television history
and has inspired millions
of people to pursue their dreams
of financial independence.
Hello I'm Carleton
Sheets and in 1970
I found myself in a position
that gave me great motivation
to succeed I was fired
from my promising corporate job.
I had no money, no credit
and a young family to support
but I had an idea that I could
be successful in real estate.
So I focused completely
on quickly learning everything
I could about it.
My enthusiasm soon gave
me very first opportunity
and that was to buy an
entire apartment building.
But having no money
I had to be creative
so I put together an offer
that let me buy the building
without using a
penny of my own money.
When I later sold that
building and made a huge profit
I thought to myself
why I hadn't I gotten
into real estate earlier.
(Announcer)
Because of Carleton's innovated
no down payment strategies
he's meet with policy
makers in Washington
and he's delivered
a speech to the U.S. Congress.
Carleton Sheets today
still very actively invests
in both residential
and commercial properties
evaluating new
properties every month.
His as well as
the current experiences
of 1000's of his students allow
the Professional
Education Institute
to continually
keep the course updated
with the latest techniques
and profit-making strategies.
I'm from a small town,
I have a high school education
I've been very successful
in Carleton Sheets course.
If I can do it
anybody can do it.
Working in the real
estate business part-time
I make more money doing
that on a monthly basis
than I do teaching
on a full-time basis.
There is no price tag
you can put on freedom.
The freedom to
spend with our child
to go to the lake
when we wanted to
to go on a vacation
when we wanted to
and not have worry about it.
And that I think is what
has been the best thing
about this for both of us.
And we definitely owe all
that to Carleton's course.
In a matter of 18 months
we acquired 29 units.
A positive cash flow
of about $2500 a month.
I bought approximately
15 properties
totaling real estate anywhere
close to 2 million dollars...
I would actually love
to thank Carleton Sheets
for what he has
given to our family.
I feel that our financial um
future is so bright right now.
My No Down Payment
investing principles work
in good times and bad.
I've been a successful real
estate investor for 35 years.
Through 7 presidents,
3 wars, 4 stock market crashes
and 5 recessions.
And history shows that
real estate is the most stable
and consistently profitable
investment people can make.
Anybody n do
Carleton's course, anybody.
High school drop-outs, college
graduates anyone can do it.
We kind of looked at the check
and we looked at each other
and we looked at the check
and we're like
good grief this works.
The thing about
Carleton's real estate course
is finally one day
made me pick up the phone
and order was the fact
that I had seen it over
and over and over again on TV.
I always wanted to do it.
I was in the situation
in my life where I needed
to do something like that.
I believed him.
I had seen his success stories.
I picked up the
phone and ordered.
That phone call
changed my life forever.
On that day is the
day I made the decision
that I
was going to be self-employed
for the rest of my life.
I would never ever
be an employee ever again.
Carleton's course
and what he taught me
gave me a vision to
do exactly what I do now
which is to pursue real estate.
Not only as
a passion and a love
but as a source
of making my income in life.
I do two separate and
distinct things in real estate
that I learned from
Carleton's course.
The first is I
own rental property.
I own 27 units with a positive
cash flow of $5300 a month.
What I do next in real
estate is to flip properties.
And the very first deal
I did in flipping a house
was scary for me but I
did exactly what Carleton said.
I bought the house
it was $19,000
and I sold it for $83,000.
I have made at least
$145,000 in the last 2 years
flipping properties.
Within a couple of
years I will be a millionaire.
Right now my
net worth is $642,000.
In my lifetime I could
not have saved up $642,000.
I don't care how much
money I made at any job.
Carleton's course has
given me enough money in my life
enough financial freedom
to do the things that I love.
I love flying.
I have enough money
now I can go rent an airplane
and fly whenever I want.
I love cars.
I've got Corvettes,
I've got Jaguars.
I've got all the cars
that I loved as a kid.
Never again will I ever
have to work for anybody else.
Carleton's course has
given me the financial freedom
I need to go out for the
rest of my life and be free.
Hi, I'm Carleton Sheets
and my No Down Payment system
shows you step-by-step
how to invest in real estate
without any cash,
credit or previous experience.
It's written
in easy to follow language
with lots of examples
that show you everything
you need to know to become a
successful real estate investor
even if you have
no money, no credit
or no real estate experience.
Of course most people
think you need money
to make money in real estate.
The truth is there are lots
of ways to buy real estate
with no money down, even if your
credit is less than perfect.
In fact my course
lists more than a dozen ways
how to buy real estate
with no down payment.
And many times you can actually
put cash in your pocket
when you buy real estate.
Don't let life pass you buy.
Make today the
day you take control
of your financial future.
Try my system for 30 days
for just $9.95, that's all.
I guarantee it can work for you
as it has for thousands
of other people.
I like to think of
us as equity farmers.
We buy properties and now
we're buying large properties.
And when you buy a large
property and you buy it right
you build equity
in those properties.
Every couple of years
you can take that property
go back to the bank,
extract the equity
just like a farmer goes out and
he harvest his crop in the field
a couple hundred
thousand dollars.
Set the property aside
let it grow equity again
A couple more years
we will be back harvesting
that equity again.
Since we've purchased
Carleton's course
we've went from $50
to $55,000 in net worth
to over 3 million
dollars in net worth.
We have a positive cash
flow of $200, $250,000 a year
and we purchased
these properties
without any money
out of our own pocket.
This is not
a stagnant course.
Every couple of years
Carleton goes through
and does wonderful
improvements to the course.
Every time there is a new course
I make sure I get it because
I don't want to be left behind
in any information that
man's got to share.
He's got the goods.
It's changed my
life from worry about
where my next paycheck
was going to come from.
Now I don't worry anymore.
Within 2 years working
only about 5 hours a week
I bought 8 properties with
absolutely no money down.
I have about 4 million
dollars worth of real estate
I couldn't be happier.

I was able
to purchase
a property
and sell
it to put cash
in my pocket
that was
equal to a full
year's salary.

retire at 55
I never
thought that
would happen.
I've quadrupled
my income
and I have over
$100,000 of cash
coming in yearly.
The
only regrets I
have from owning
Carleton's
course is I didn't
own it sooner.
In my No Down Payment
course I'll show you
more than a dozen different
ways to buy real estate
without using a
penny of your own money.
And I even show you how you
can get cash back at closing.
We just closed on
a store-lot facility
a million dollar deal.
Bought it with no
money out of our pocket.
At closing we had a check
for just under $20,000.
We went through
Carleton's course
and we began getting money back
on almost every deal that did.
In the 3 years of
using Carleton's course
I've gotten over $200,000
in cash back at closing.
$91,000 cash back at closing.
Over the last 2 years we've only
been doing this for 2 years.
It's been phenomenal the
Carleton Sheets method works.
When you are a real estate
investor you can generate
a large extra spendable
income in your spare time
right from your own home.
You can work as much as
you like or little as you want.
And you don't ever have
to quit your full-time job
unless you choose to.
I spend about 5 hours a week
working with the real estate.
I'm making over $90,000 a year.
I'm spending a lot
of time with my family.
I'm having a great time with it.
In the 6 years that we've
been using Carleton's techniques
we've been able to put
over $500,000 in profits
and proceeds in our pockets.
I have a net worth
of about 2 million dollars.
My kids know who I am
now the even say hi to me.
You know we go
places, we do things.
I was never to
a ball game before
before I got into this business.
Now I see almost all of them.
Paul Forsberg grew
up in a small fishing town
in up-state New York where
he followed his family's legacy
of commercial
fishing until one day
when a television
show changed his life.
(Paul)
It was real tough
way of making living.
I spent over 200
days a year at sea.
I would only get to
see my wife and children
intermittently for
a week here, 2 days there
that type of thing.
I saw Carleton Sheets'
program on television
decided to buy it.
I was actually kind of shock
when I first got the course.
Reviewing the first
couple pages I was just
it seemed like
it was child's play.
Like any kindergarten
kid could do this.
I just couldn't believe
it was that simple.
After reviewing the
course for the 2nd time
I realized that you
know even though I just got
through high school
by the skin of my teeth
that I could do this too.
I bought my first
2 houses 15 days apart.
So in 3 years time
I went from nothing
to right now I have a
net worth of $1,911,000
with a positive cash
flow of $6950 a month.
Living in a
3,000 square foot house
drive a brand new truck.
My wife quit work
and I have 2 boats
one in my back yard and
I have one in Florida
that I just came back from
doing a 2 week vacation on.
I never in a million
years thought that I'd be
living a life like this.
You know when I watch the
Carleton show about buying
the course I
was "yeah that's nice.
People living a dream like that.
That will never happen to me."
I bought the course and
I did what they told me to do
and the rest is history.
It's all mine I just followed
the course step-by-step.
My course shows you
how to invest in real estate
without any money not one dime.
In fact you will even
learn how you can buy property
and put cash in you pocket
when you close the transaction.
And real estate is
the only investment
that can yield huge
profits without having to
risk or invest
any money of your own.
Now you can try my course
in the comfort of your own home
for 30 days for just $9.95.
Get the course, follow my system
and see how it works for you.
If you're not completely
satisfied just return it
and owe nothing more.
So you see you just can't lose.
I can remember the moment
like it was yesterday.
The kids and I were driving
home I saw smoke in the distance
We had lived on a big
farm and it was the house
that was burning down you
could see it from the street.
It was tough we
didn't have any money
and
didn't have any credit either,
couldn't go borrow money.
You know, nobody
would help, nobody helped.
Loren use to stay awake a lot
of nights
and he saw the
Carleton Sheets program.
And I thought Carleton's
sincerity was real
so I bought his course.
When we actually
sat down and started,
started really going over
the course within two weeks
we bought a property.
And not only did we buy
a property with no money down
we found good tenants
because in Carleton's course
he teaches exactly
what to watch for.
He tells you how to screen them.
Gives you even the
applications and the agreements
the rental agreements.
Everything was right there and
since we got Carleton's course
we now have a net worth
of over 1.2 million dollars
and we have a spenable
cash flow of $7100 per month.
We never put any cash
into our properties
and we have had
cash back at closing
over $242,000 within the
last 3 years, which is a lot.
It's a good amount.
We really, really in
5 years have come a long way.
We're building
the home that we designed
and it's over 3,000 sq. ft.
and we're building
it as a family.
Our lives are so different
now and so positive
and so exciting all
the time and Carleton
had everything to do with that.
I mean he really did.
I know a lot of us
watch the show over and over
and over before we
finally picked up the phone
and ordered but that's
called paralysis of analysis.
After I read the course
that's what Carleton calls it.
It's time now.
If you're watching
this show again it's time
to pick up the phone right now.
The course for my wife and I and
family has changed our lives.
From the day we ordered
it and we filled in
that little blank that
we bought our first house
in 90 days we never looked back.
Left corporate America
and it changed our lives.
For 20 years you've seen
people with me on shows
just like this one
sharing their successes.
And it never fails.
Each year someone says,
"Carleton I only wish
I hadn't waited so long
to order your course."

this happen to you.

The course works
if you work it.
It's very
simple the way
it's laid out.
There's really
nothing to think
about at all.
All
the information
is there
in the
course if you
just use it.
Within
the first year
I must
have increased
my net worth
by $100,000.
Before we bought
Carleton's
course
our net worth
was somewhere
around $50,000.
As of today
our net worth is
a million dollars.
I was maybe making
$15, $16,000 a year.
And raising 2 sons
that's pretty rough.
I was looking
at TV late at night
and I kept seeing
this infomercial.
I just kept seeing it.
And I said there has got
to be something to this course
so I just took the
chance and ordered it.
And I think that
was the best thing,
the best move I
ever made in my life.
Carleton just it so plain
and simple it made sense.
And so instead of
looking for a place to rent
I actually started
looking for a place to buy.
I purchased that first property
and it was rent to own.
I put down less money than
if I would have been renting.
Up to this point I've bought
since I started with Carleton's
course maybe 52 properties.
I have gotten cash
back at every single deal
at least $600,000 cash back.
My net worth is 1.2 million
but I just feel
like an average guy.
I just feel lucky.
The greatest feeling in
the world is that peace of mind
that I can wake
up in the morning
knowing that I can
take care of my family.
Knowing that I can get
them the extras in life
and knowing that I
don't have to worry about
where is my next meal and
how I'm going to feed my family.
That's the best
feeling in the world
and I owe it all to the
Carleton Sheets course.
You can always buy
houses with no money down
and Carleton's course shows
you exactly how to do that.
Carleton's No Down Payment
course has allowed me
to buy dozens of properties
with no money down.
I've quadrupled my income
and I have over $100,000
of cash coming in yearly.
I've never used my own money.
I've never put any of my own
money down to acquire property.
My down payment techniques
can work in any area.
There are 1000's of students
using my No Down Payment
techniques from coast to coast.
It will work any
state any where any time.
It doesn't matter where you are
you can make money
with this course.
The most important
reason I say anyone
in any circumstance can succeed
as a real estate investor
is you don't need any
cash or credit to do it.
What I'm telling you
here is an amazing fact.
You don't need
money to make money.
My course is
called No Down Payment
for a good reason.
It teaches you
more than a dozen ways
how to buy real estate
with no down payment.
This fact is the key
to anyone including you
getting started and
becoming a successful
real estate investor.
I don't have a 401K
plan but I don't have to
worry about the
stock market plummeting.
With real estate
it's there I still get my
rental income every month.
If you want to go
into the stock market
you'd better have
a lot of your own money
before you get there.
Because you can't buy
you're way into the stock market
with nothing down.
Financial independence
empowers you
to take control of your life.
So that you can live
the way you've always wanted.
Time and time
again people tell me
that they don't think
they can buy real estate
because they've got
bad or no credit.
Well the truth is you
don't need good credit
to buy real estate
with no down payment.
The fact is many of
my most successful students
were in pretty bad financial
shape when ordered my course.
They had nothing and in
some cases less than nothing.
But today they are
financially independent
and their journey
started with a desire
for a better life
and a simple phone call
to order my system.
Why not make this the
moment you stop dreaming
about a better life
you and your family
and start building one.
I am now flying so high
being able to afford my family
and myself just about
anything we want.
And being able to give
them the most important thing
which is myself.
Buy this course.
It absolutely will
change your life.

Announcer: THE FOLLOWING IS A
PAID ADVERTISEMENT FOR
DIRECTBUY, AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE
WAY TO BUY DIRECT FOR YOUR HOME.
THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT
RETAILERS DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE
BECAUSE OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT
TO BE DISCLOSED. THEY DON'T WANT
YOU TO LEARN JUST HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU'VE BEEN GIVING AWAY TO
RETAIL MARKUPS ON ITEMS YOU
PURCHASED FOR YOUR HOME ALL
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO
BUY LIKE THE INSIDERS DO.
IF YOU OWN A HOME BIG OR SMALL,
NEW OR NOT SO NEW, IF YOU'RE
BUILDING, REMODELING, OR SIMPLY
REDECORATING A ROOM, THERE'S
NOW A WAY TO BUY EVERYTHING YOU
NEED AT PRICES YOU NEVER
IMAGINED POSSIBLE. NO STORE
MARK-UPS. JUST TOP QUALI,
NAME BRAND PRODUCTS ALL
AVAILABLE AT THE PRICE THE
MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR
AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS WILL
SELL A PRODUCT FOR, NOT THE
MARKED-UP PRICES YOU FIND AT THE
STORES. NOW YOU TOO CAN BE ON
THE INSIDE TRACK AND STOP GIVING
YOUR MONEY AWAY EVERY TIME YOU
BUY SOMETHING FOR YOUR HOME.
HERE TO TELL YOU MORE ABOUT HOW
TO BUY LIKE THE INSIDERS DO
FROM THE DIRECTBUY SHOWROOM IS
YOUR HOST, LEISA HART.
Leisa Hart: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOU, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S
ALWAYS SOMETHING TO BUY FOR MY
HOME. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
YOUR HOUSE IS NEW OR OLD, IF
YOU'RE REMODELING OR REBUILDING,
OR JUST BUYING A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR AROUND THE HOUSE.
HAVE YOU EVER ADDED UP THE COSTS
FOR ALL THE ITEMS YOU NEED FOR
YOUR HOME? IT'S THOUSANDS, OR
EVEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS. WELL, NO NEED TO WORRY
ANYMORE. WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW TO GET MOST EVERYTHING YOU
WANT AND NEED FOR YOUR HOME AT
PRICES EVEN LOWER THAN SALE
PRICES.
Greg Madsen: WE'VE BEEN MEMBERS
FOR A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AND
WE'VE SAVED I THINK WELL OVER
$20,000.
Aaron Hopmayer: WE'VE SAVED
PROBABLY ALMOST IN EXCESS OF
$18,000.
Lynn Tamburino: THIS IS GOING TO
SOUND CRAZY, BUT WE SAVED ALMOST
$20,000. SAVED. NOT SPENT,
SAVED $20,000.
Maggie Becerra: A TOTAL OF OVER
$25,000 IN THE LAST 8 MONTHS.
Gayle Graham: THESE FOLDERS
REPRESENT THE LAST 7 OR 8 MONTHS
OF MY PURCHASES AT DIRECTBUY.
THIS HERE REPRESENTS ABOUT A
$30,000 TO $40,000 SAVINGS
OVERALL.
Sandi Fox: WE HAVE SAVED ABOUT
$50,000.
Joy Gape: I FIGURE WITH THIS
HOUSE AND ALL THAT I'VE SAVED
OVER, BETWEEN $100,000 AND
$150,000.
Leisa Hart: DIRECTBUY IS PART OF
A BUYING ORGANIZATION STARTED
OVER 30 YEARS AGO BY PEOPLE WHO
WERE FED UP WITH THE HIGH
MARKUPS RETAILERS CHARGE ON
THINGS LIKE FURNITURE, FLOORING,
AND OTHER ITEMS FOR YOUR HOME.
THEY REALIZED THAT AS CONSUMERS,
BY PAYING RETAIL WE ARE SIMPLY
LOSING MONEY THAT WE CAN NEVER
GET BACK. TODAY, THERE ARE MORE
THAN 100 DIRECTBUY CENTERS
ACROSS NORTH AMERICA, SAVING
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR.
Tony Gulotta: HI. I'M TONY
GULOTTA, THIS IS MY WIFE KARI
GULOTTA, THIS IS OUR HOUSE, MY
WIFE'S DREAM HOUSE. AND WE'VE
FURNISHED MOST EVERYTHING IN
THIS HOUSE WITH PRODUCTS FROM
DIRECTBUY. THAT FIXTURE WAS OVER
$1,600?
Kari: $1,600. WE GOT IT FOR
ABOUT $758 THROUGH DIRECTBUY.
Tony: THIS IS THE HEARTH ROOM,
KITCHEN AREA. THIS COUCH WE SAW
AT SOME OTHER RETAILERS, IT WAS
APPROXIMATELY $2,000. WE PICKED
IT UP AT DIRECTBUY FOR AROUND
$900. THE TILE ON THE FLOOR, WE
PICKED OUT AT DIRECTBUY, THE
BAR STOOLS WE PICKED OUT AT
DIRECTBUY, THEN WE ALSO
PURCHASED THE BREAKFAST TABLE
AND CHAIRS. WE LOOKED AT THAT
TABLE AT SOME OTHER PLACES.
HOW MUCH WAS THAT TABLE, KARI?
Kari: IT RAN AROUND $3,500 AND
WE PICKED IT UP FOR AROUND
$1,500. SO, IT WAS QUITE A BIG
SAVINGS FOR US.
Tony: THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE WAS
A PARADE OF HOMES HOUSE. IT HAD
PROBABLY CLOSE TO OVER 2,000
PEOPLE COMING THROUGH IT AND ONE
OF THE COMMENTS ALL THE PEOPLE
MADE WAS, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR
FURNITURE? WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
SO, THEY WERE PLEASANTLY
SURPRISED WHEN WE TOLD THEM
DIRECTBUY. AND THEY WERE LIKE,
YOU'RE KIDDING? THE SAME PLACE
WE SEE ON TV? SO...
Kari: AND THEY THOUGHT WE SPENT
ABOUT $100,000 JUST FURNISHING
THIS HOUSE. AND I WAS JUST LIKE,
OH, IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW MUCH WE
REALLY SPENT. IT WASN'T EVEN
NEAR THAT.
Leisa: COMPARED TO ANY OTHER WAY
OF BUYING, DIRECTBUY STANDS
ALONE. IT MAKES YOU AN INDUSTRY
INSIDER. YOU'LL ENJOY ACCESS TO
THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS AT A
SINGLE LOCATION, ALL AT DIRECT
PRICES. IN MOST CASES, YOU
CHOOSE FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S
ENTIRE PRODUCT LINES IN
CATEGORIES SUCH AS WINDOWS,
FLOORING, LIGHTING, PLUMBING
FIXTURES, CABINETS, APPLIANCES,
AND EVEN FURNITURE.
YOU GET THE SAME EXACT ITEMS
YOU'D FIND IN A STORE, WITH THE
SAME MANUFACTURERS' WARRANTIES.
YOU JUST PAY A WHOLE LOT LESS.
DESIGN, DELIVERY, AND
INSTALLATION SERVICES ARE ALL
AVAILABLE AT YOUR LOCAL
DIRECTBUY CENTER.
SINCE DIRECTBUY DOESN'T MARK UP
THE MERCHANDISE LIKE RETAILERS
DO, THERE'S NEVER ANY PRESSURE
TO BUY. YOU SHOP IN A
COMFORTABLE, FRIENDLY
ENVIRONMENT, FREE FROM THE SALES
PRESSURE FOUND IN A TYPICAL
STORE. IT'S MORE LIKE A PRIVATE
CLUB THAN A STORE. AND WHILE
YOU'RE BUSY SAVING MONEY, YOUR
KIDS WILL BE BUSY PLAYING IN AN
AREA THAT'S DESIGNED ESPECIALLY
FOR THEM. FROM THE PRICE YOU
PAY TO THE WAY YOU SHOP,
EVERYTHING AT DIRECTBUY IS
DESIGNED TO MAKE YOUR EXPERIENCE
EASY AND ENJOYABLE.
THAT'S THE DIRECTBUY DIFFERENCE.
Kristin Palmer: AT DIRECTBUY YOU
JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AT HOME,
YOU KNOW, IT'S A VERY
COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. THEY
MAKES SHOPPING EASY.
Sarah Kauffman: THERE IS SOMEONE
THERE TO HELP YOU. MAKE SURE
YOUR FABRICS GO TOGETHER WELL.
THAT THE, YOU KNOW, THAT EVEN
THE LIGHTING IN YOUR HOUSE IS
GOING TO REFLECT THE TRUE
COLORS.
Lance Tharnish: THE STAFF THAT
WE DEALT WITH AT DIRECTBUY HAS
BEEN EXEMPLARY.
Carrol Lopez: THE PEOPLE THERE
ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE.
Joy Gape: I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING
TO A CLUB BECAUSE I KNOW
EVERYBODY THERE.
Aaron Hopmayer: OUR EXPERIENCES
HAVE BEEN JUST POSITIVE ACROSS
THE BOARD. IT'S LIKE WALKING
INTO CHEERS. YEAH, HOW ARE YA?
Leisa: WHY LOSE MONEY PAYING
RETAIL IF YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO?
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OLD,
OUTDATED MASTER BEDROOM.
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU
AT DIRECTBUY, YOU COULD
TRANSFORM THIS ROOM INTO THIS
NEW, COMPLETELY REDECORATED
MASTER BEDROOM AND KEEP OVER
$2,000 IN YOUR POCKET, COMPARED
TO WHAT YOU WOULD PAY, EVEN ON
SALE PRICES. LET'S TAKE A CLOSER
LOOK. THIS FOUR PIECE, CHERRY
BEDROOM SET IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF
OUR NEW ROOM. THIS BEDROOM SET
MIGHT HAVE AN MSRP THAT'S
HIGHER, BUT THE ACTUAL STORE
SELLING PRICE FOR THESE FOUR
ITEMS COMES TO $3,496. IT'S VERY
GOOD QUALITY FROM A WELL-KNOWN
MANUFACTURER AND IT SEEMS TO BE
A GOOD DEAL FOR SUCH A NICE SET.
BUT LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT
THAT PRICE. DID YOU KNOW IN
THE HOME FURNISHING AREA ALONE,
STORES ENJOY A GROSS MARGIN OF
43.3% ON AVERAGE? NOW
REMEMBER, AT DIRECTBUY, YOU PAY
THE MANUFACTURER'S PRICE FOR
THAT SET. THAT MEANS AT
DIRECTBUY, THE ACTUAL COST OF
YOUR BEDROOM SET THAT SELLS AT
THE STORE FOR $3,496 IS ONLY
$1,773.61. YOU'RE LOSING OVER
$1,700 WHEN YOU BUY FROM THE
STORE. AND THAT'S JUST ONE
PURCHASE. ADD IN THE MATTRESS
AND BOX SPRINGS, WINDOW
TREATMENTS, LIGHTING, AND YOUR
SAVINGS JUST KEEP ADDING UP.
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH EASIER IT
IS TO GET THE MASTER BEDROOM
YOU ALWAYS WANTED. NOW YOU CAN
TAKE THAT BUYING POWER AND FILL
YOUR WHOLE HOME WITH TOP
QUALITY, NAME BRAND ITEMS, EACH
AND EVERY ONE BOUGHT AT
CONFIDENTIAL, INSIDER PRICES.
Maggie Becerra: BOX SPRING AND
MATTRESS, UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS
GOING TO COST ME $2,200 FOR A
KING BED. FOR BOTH OF THEM, I
ENDED UP GETTING IT FOR $800 FOR
BOTH OF THEM.
Tony Mangiaracina: THE FIRST
ESTIMATE THAT WE HAD WAS $20,000
TO REDO THE KITCHEN. AND THE
ACTUAL COST OF WHAT WE HAD DONE
TO THE KITCHEN THROUGH DIRECTBUY
WAS UNDER $10,000.
Gayle Graham: WE SAVED ABOUT
$6,000 TO $7,000 ON THAT
FLOORING ALONE.
Connie Crippen: WE WERE ABLE TO
GET PROBABLY ABOUT A $50 A
SQUARE YARD CARPETING FOR
SOMEWHERE AROUND $24 A SQUARE
YARD.
Sarah Kauffman: THE CHAIRS
RETAILED FOR ABOUT 220 EACH, AND
I THINK I PAID $74 PER CHAIR.
IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO GET WHAT
YOU WANT AND SAVE MONEY AT IT.
Leisa: NO WONDER THIS IS THE
INFORMATION THE RETAILERS DON'T
WANT YOU TO SEE. AND YOU CAN'T
SEE IT UNLESS YOU'RE A RETAILER,
A BUYER, OR YOU BELONG TO
DIRECTBUY. IT'S THE SMART WAY.
IT'S THE INSIDER'S WAY TO TURN
YOUR HOUSE INTO THAT DREAM HOME
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, WITHOUT
GIVING YOUR MONEY AWAY. THAT'S
THE DIRECTBUY DIFFERENCE.
WE SAVED $7,000 WITHIN SEVEN
MONTHS.
JUST ON OUR KITCHEN ALONE, WE
SAVED ALMOST $10,000.
IT ADDS UP TO ABOUT A $30,000
TO $40,000 SAVINGS OVERALL.
WE'VE SAVED OVER $50,000.
COMES TO ABOUT $127,000.
RUN, DON'T WALK TO DIRECTBUY
AND SIGN UP, BECAUSE LITERALLY
WE SPENT $27,000 IN UPGRADES
JUST TO OUR KITCHEN ALONE.
AND THOSE SAME CABINETS WOULD'VE
COST US ABOUT $8,000 THROUGH
DIRECTBUY.
Announcer: RETAILERS DON'T WANT
YOU TO SEE THIS INFORMATION.
DIRECTBUY MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO
CONFIDENTIAL, MANUFACTURERS'
PRICES FOR THE EXACT SAME ITEMS
YOU'D FIND IN A RETAIL STORE.
IMAGINE PAYING INSIDER'S PRICES
FOR ITEMS LIKE KITCHEN CABINETS,
COUNTER TOPS AND APPLIANCES,
FLOORING FOR YOUR ENTIRE HOME,
WINDOWS AND WINDOW COVERINGS,
PLUMBING FIXTURES AND FURNITURE.
FROM BEDROOMS TO DINING ROOMS TO
HOME OFFICES, PLUS MUCH MORE.

FIXING UP A ROOM, YOU WON'T LOSE

STORES. SO CALL THE NUMBER ON

Leisa: BUYING RETAIL SEEMS
INNOCENT ENOUGH, ESPECIALLY IF
YOU HAPPEN TO FIND SOMETHING ON
SALE. BUT DID YOU EVER STOP TO
ASK YOURSELF HOW A BIG RETAILER
CAN MAKE ANY MONEY SELLING
SOMETHING AT 40 OR EVEN 50%
OFF THE MANUFACTURER'S SUGGESTED
RETAIL PRICE? EVEN AT HALF OFF,
THE FACT IS, YOUR LOCAL STORE IS
STILL MAKING PLENTY OF MONEY.
THEY HAVE TO JUST TO STAY IN
BUSINESS. AT DIRECTBUY, YOU'LL
SEE EXACTLY HOW A STORE CAN
AFFORD TO PUT THINGS ON SALE.
NOW, THE NUMBER MANY RETAILERS
USE AS A REFERENCE IS THE
MANUFACTURER'S SUGGESTED RETAIL
PRICE OR MSRP. THAT'S THE PRICE
THE MANUFACTURER SUGGESTS THE
RETAILER SELL THEIR PRODUCT TO
YOU, THE CONSUMER. THE STORE MAY
ESTABLISH THEIR OWN PRICE,
HOWEVER, THEY TYPICALLY
"DISCOUNT" FROM THERE. BUT
UNLESS YOU KNEW WHAT THE
MANUFACTURER SOLD THE ITEM FOR,
YOU'D HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF
THE SALE PRICE IS ACTUALLY A
GOOD DEAL OR NOT. WITH
DIRECTBUY, YOU'RE NO LONGER IN
THE DARK WHEN IT COMES TO
KNOWING THE COST OF AN ITEM.
Chris Korte: PRIOR TO JOINING
DIRECTBUY, WE'D ALREADY PRICED
OUT OUR WHOLE ENTIRE HOUSE OF
CABINETRY FOR THIS PROJECT, AND
IT WAS GOING TO COME TO A
LITTLE OVER $60,000. I THINK
ABOUT $62,000. WHEN WE WENT BACK
TO DIRECTBUY AND SHOWED THEM THE
PROJECT PLANS, THEY CAME BACK
WITH A PRICE AND WE HAVE IT AS
$38,000, AND THAT WAS EVERYTHING
INCLUDED, SO, AGAIN, THE
SAVINGS IS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE
TRUE.
Sheila Korte: BECAUSE WE DID
PURCHASE THIS THROUGH DIRECTBUY,
WE WERE ABLE TO UPGRADE AND GET
THE DESIGNER LOOK.
Chris: WE PRICED OUT $23,000
WORTH OF APPLIANCES TO FINISH
OFF THE KITCHEN, AND WE GOT
THESE FOR UNDER $15,000. WE HAVE
THE REFRIGERATOR, MICROWAVE,
DOUBLE OVEN, WE HAVE COOK TOP
OVER HERE. SO...AND THE HOOD.
AND THEN A WINE COOLER, WHICH WE
HAD TO HAVE THE BUILDER MAKE A
SPECIAL SPACE FOR IT, BECAUSE
ONCE I REALIZED HOW MUCH MONEY I
COULD SAVE ON THIS ITEM, I
WANTED TO INCLUDE IT IN
THE KITCHEN.
Sheila: ONE OF THE FINISHING
TOUCHES WE PURCHASED AT
DIRECTBUY WERE THESE 3 STOOLS.
I HAD PRICED STOOLS THAT I HAD
WANTED. THEY WERE ABOUT 300,
350. THESE WERE $100 AT
DIRECTBUY. I REALLY LIKE THAT.
Leisa: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
ANOTHER ROOM AND SEE HOW
DIRECTBUY CAN HELP YOU TRANSFORM
YOUR HOME AT A FRACTION OF THE
RETAIL PRICE. IMAGINE GOING FROM
THIS OUTDATED LIVING ROOM TO
THIS HIGH END, COMPLETELY
REDECORATED, MODEL-HOME-STYLE
LIVING ROOM AND SAVING OVER
$4,000 COMPARED TO BUYING THE
ITEMS AT A STORE. LET'S TAKE A
CLOSER LOOK. THE AREA RUG ALONE
MIGHT HAVE AN MSRP THAT'S
HIGHER, BUT THE STORE IS
ACTUALLY SELLING IT FOR $1,199.
NOW THE DIRECTBUY PRICE IS JUST
$549.75. YOU SAVE $649.25 OFF
THE STORE PRICE. AND LOOK AT
THESE WINDOW COVERINGS. THEY
START OUT WITH AN MSRP OF
$1,972, BUT YOU CAN USUALLY FIND
THEM ON SALE. IN THIS CASE, THE
STORE WAS RUNNING A 50% OFF
SALE, WHICH KNOCKED IT DOWN TO
$986. BUT COMPARE THAT TO THE
DIRECTBUY PRICE OF JUST $581.94.
THAT'S A SAVINGS OF OVER $400
OFF THAT 50% SALE PRICE. WE'LL
GET TO THE OTHER ITEMS IN THIS
LIVING ROOM IN JUST A LITTLE
BIT, BUT IN THOSE TWO ITEMS
ALONE YOU'RE NO LONGER THROWING
AWAY OVER $1,000 THAT YOU WOULD
HAVE IF YOU BOUGHT THEM IN A
STORE. THIS IS CALLED THE
DIRECTBUY DIFFERENCE. BUT I'VE
COME TO KNOW IT AS SMART
SHOPPING. IT'S THE WAY I BUY
THINGS FOR MY HOME ALL THE TIME.
Naomi Madsen: WE SAVED ON OUR
WINDOWS. IT WAS ALMOST $17,000.
AND, I MEAN, THAT WAS OUR FIRST
PURCHASE.
Greg: WE HAD THIS CONSULTANT
FROM THE OTHER WINDOW COMPANY.
WE WERE GOING TO BUY 6 WINDOWS.
LITERALLY JUST GET 6 OF 'EM FOR
THE FIRST INCREMENT OF
REPLACEMENT.
Naomi: AND IT WAS--AND THAT
AMOUNT WAS JUST ABOUT THE
AMOUNT THAT WE PAID FOR THE
ENTIRE 22 WINDOWS.
Walter Holmes: TO ME, A SIMPLE
CABINET WITH A NICE BIG MIRROR
ON IT AND STUFF, THEY WANTED
OVER $600 OR $700 FOR THIS
CABINET AND I'M LIKE, MY GOSH,
CARROL, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS,
AND WE GOT IT AT DIRECTBUY. I
THINK WE PAID $200.
Carrol: $200, RIGHT. ABOUT 200.
William Palmer: I'D ALREADY
PRICED HOT TUBS. WE'RE PLANNING
ON BUILDING A DECK SOMETIME
SOON, AND I KNOW THAT THE PRICE
AT DIRECTBUY IS ALMOST $1,000
LESS THAN WHAT I CAN GET AT ONE
OF THE NATIONALLY KNOWN CHAINS
WHERE I CAN PURCHASE THE SAME
EXACT UNIT, LIKE I SAID, FOR
$1,000 MORE. WHO WOULDN'T WANT
TO SAVE $1,000?
Howard Fox: WHEN YOU REALIZE
THAT THIS GOBLET IS $40,
THE OUTLET PRICE IS 50% OFF OF
THAT, BRINGING IT TO $20.
DIRECTBUY'S PRICE IS 40% OFF OF
THAT PRICE, BRINGING IT DOWN TO
$12. THAT'S A BIG SAVINGS.
Carol Mangiaracina: ONE OF THE
ESTIMATES THAT WE HAD GOTTEN WAS
$10,000 TO REDO THIS SMALL
BATHROOM. IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A
BATHROOM AND I THINK THAT IT
ENDED UP COSTING US, WITH
EVERYTHING, INCLUDING LABOR,
UNDER $3,000.
Leisa: IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, I
JUST KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A WAY
TO GET THE ITEMS I REALLY WANTED
FOR MY HOME DIRECTLY FROM THE
SOURCE. BUT I COULD NEVER FIND
IT. I SEARCHED THE OUTLET MALLS,
THE INTERNET, AND FACTORY STORES
TRYING TO GET THE BEST DEAL.
WHAT I FOUND WAS DISCONTINUED,
SECONDS, OR PRICING NOT MUCH
DIFFERENT FROM THE STORES. THEN
I HEARD ABOUT DIRECTBUY. ONCE I
TOOK THE TIME TO VISIT THE
SHOWROOM AND LEARN HOW IT WORKS,
AND WHAT IT OFFERS, I KNEW
DIRECTBUY WAS EXACTLY WHAT I'D
I'D BEEN LOOKING FOR.
Mark Webb: ONE OF OUR FAVORITE
PURCHASES FROM DIRECTBUY WERE
OUR HARDWOOD FLOORS. WE ACTUALLY
SAVED $5,000 WHEN WE BOUGHT THE
HARDWOOD FLOORS THROUGH
DIRECTBUY OVER THE COMPETITION.
WE WERE ABLE TO DO HARDWOOD
FLOORS IN OTHER ROOMS THROUGHOUT
THE HOUSE BECAUSE OF THE SAVINGS
THAT WE HAD. OUR COUNTERTOPS ARE
ANOTHER PURCHASE THAT WE HAD
THROUGH DIRECTBUY. WE PRICED
THESE OUT AT $13,000. WHEN WE
WENT THROUGH DIRECTBUY, THEY
WERE ABLE TO GET IT TO US FOR
$7,000. THE MASTER BATH, I
REALLY FEEL WE UPGRADED THE
TILE, WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY
UPGRADE WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO
WITH THE BATHROOM AND GET THE
DETAIL AND THE ORNATE EDGING.
WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE AGAIN
$4,000 - $5,000 ON OUR TILE
OVERALL THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE
HOUSE.
Leisa: SOME PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
ON THE INSIDE TRACK. THEY FOUND
A WAY TO BUY AT PRICES EVEN
LOWER THAN SALE PRICES. THEY
STOPPED THROWING THEIR FAMILY'S
MONEY AWAY. THESE EXCLUSIVE
INSIDERS ARE NOW ENJOYING THE
BENEFIT OF BUYING DIRECT WITH
DIRECTBUY. THERE IS NO REASON
WHY YOU TOO CAN'T BE A PART OF
THIS AMAZING WAY TO BUY JUST
LIKE AN INSIDER. BUY MORE. BUY
SMARTER. BUY THE DIRECTBUY WAY
AND HAVE VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING
YOU WANT AND NEED FOR YOUR HOME
ALL AT DIRECT PRICES.
WE SAVED $7,000 WITHIN 7
MONTHS.
JUST ON OUR KITCHEN ALONE, WE
SAVED ALMOST $10,000.
IT ADDS UP TO ABOUT A $30,000
TO $40,000 SAVINGS OVERALL.
WE'VE SAVED OVER $50,000.
COMES TO ABOUT $127,000.
RUN, DON'T WALK TO DIRECTBUY
AND SIGN UP, BECAUSE LITERALLY
WE SPENT $27,000 IN UPGRADES
JUST TO OUR KITCHEN ALONE, AND
THOSE SAME CABINETS WOULD'VE
COST US ABOUT $8,000 THROUGH
DIRECTBUY.

Leisa: MANY DIRECTBUY MEMBERS
WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE'S AN
ADDED BONUS TO BEING A PART OF
THIS BUYING REVOLUTION. IT'S
THE ABILITY TO BUY BETTER.
THERE'S A CERTAIN PRIDE WE ALL
TAKE IN OUR HOMES AND KNOWING
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO SETTLE FOR
THINGS LIKE LOWER GRADE
CABINETS OR LESSER QUALITY
CARPET, OR EVEN LAMINATE
FLOORING INSTEAD OF HARDWOOD IS
VERY EMPOWERING. AT DIRECTBUY,
WITHOUT SPENDING MORE, YOU CAN
BUY BETTER.
Lance Tharnish: GOING THROUGH
DIRECTBUY, WE WERE ABLE TO NOT
ONLY STAY AROUND $3,500 TO
$4,000 BELOW WHAT OUR BUILDER
HAD AN ALLOWANCE FOR, BUT ALSO
GET A HIGHER, BETTER QUALITY
THAN BEFORE.
Sarah Kauffman: WE HAVE
UPGRADED, YOU KNOW, OUR
SELECTION AND WE'RE STILL
SAVING MORE THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING PAY FOR THE LOWER
END MODEL.
Aaron Hopmayer:THE IDEA OF GOING
DIRECTBUY AND BEING ABLE TO
PURCHASE THINGS, WHICH NORMALLY
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD ON
MY SALARY, IS QUITE APPEALING.
WE WERE ABLE TO, LIKE I SAID,
PURCHASE GRANITE COUNTERTOPS,
SOLID WOOD CABINETS.
Melissa: WOOD FLOORS THROUGH OUR
ENTIRE HOUSE.
Aaron: AND IT'S NICE, TO BE
HONEST WITH YA, TO SAY TO PEOPLE
HEY LOOK, I ALSO HAVE A GRANITE
COUNTERTOP.
Tony Mangiaracina: IT'S NOT JUST
FOR THE WEALTHY. BEING A
TEACHER, I'M NOT PAID AS MUCH AS
MAYBE SOME OTHER PEOPLE WOULD
BE, BUT WE HAVE REALIZED THROUGH
DIRECTBUY WE CAN GET BETTER
QUALITY PRODUCTS, EVEN ON THE
SALARY THAT I MAKE.
Leisa: IT'S NOT A ONE TIME
OFFER. IT'S NOT A LIMITED OFFER.
IT'S JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE
DONE EVERYDAY AT DIRECTBUY.
THE SAVINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT.
IN FACT, THE MORE YOU SPEND WITH
DIRECTBUY, THE MORE YOU SAVE.
THINK OF ALL THE MONEY YOU'VE
LOST OVER THE YEARS WITHOUT
BEING ON THE INSIDE TRACK.
IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF
ASTOUNDING. TAKE A LOOK AT WHY
SO MANY DIRECTBUY MEMBERS ARE
ABLE TO GO FROM THIS TO THIS.
REMEMBER OUR NEWLY REDECORATED
LIVING ROOM FROM EARLIER?
THIS BEAUTIFUL HIGH-END LEATHER
SOFA IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
PEOPLE OFTEN WANT, BUT THINK
THEY CAN'T AFFORD. THAT'S
BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURE'S
SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE FOR THIS
SOFA IS $4,649. RETAILERS OFTEN
SELL BELOW MSRP AND HERE EVEN
THE DISCOUNTED RETAIL PRICE IS
STILL $3,099. THE EVERYDAY
DIRECTBUY COST IS JUST
$1,741.94. THAT'S $1,357.06
THAT YOU KEEP IN YOUR POCKET
WHILE YOU ENJOY THE IDENTICAL
LEATHER SOFA. OR TAKE THAT
DIFFERENCE, BUY THE MATCHING
LEATHER CHAIR, AND YOU STILL
HAVE OVER $500 IN YOUR POCKET.
SUDDENLY EVEN DISCOUNTED PRICES
SEEM WAY TOO HIGH. NOW YOU'RE
BEGINNING TO SEE HOW YOU'RE JUST
GIVING YOUR MONEY AWAY IF YOU'RE
NOT USING DIRECTBUY. IT JUST
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE
BUYING RETAIL ANYMORE.
Kristin Palmer: I DON'T THINK WE
COULD EVER GO INTO CERTAIN
STORES AND PURCHASE SOMETHING
JUST BECAUSE OUT OF CONSCIENCE,
YOU KNOW, I JUST COULDN'T LET
MYSELF BUY THAT WAY AGAIN.
Gayle Graham: HERE AT DIRECTBUY,
JUST FOR EXAMPLE, I GOT THIS ONE
LIGHT, AND I PAID 109 FOR IT,
AND IN THE STORE IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN OVER $200.
Mark Edmond: IF YOU TRUST YOUR
BUILDER, YOUR CONTRACTOR STATING
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOU
THE BEST PRICE, THEY'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR YEARS, THEY BUY
IN BULK SO THEY GET THE, YOU
KNOW, THE BEST PRICE THAT YOU
CAN GET FROM A MANUFACTURER,
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.
Chris Korte: I KNEW I NEEDED A
JETTED HOT TUB. IT WAS ALMOST A
$2,000 SAVINGS ON THE TUB ALONE.
Lynn Tamburino: WE WOULD NEVER,
EVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE
THINGS THAT WE GOT IF WE HAD TO
PAY RETAIL.
Leisa: AS A MEMBER OF DIRECTBUY,
YOU CAN BUY NEARLY EVERYTHING
YOU NEED FOR YOUR HOME AT
INSIDER PRICES, JUST LIKE THE
STORES.
Joy Gape: I HAVE TO TELL YOU
ABOUT MY MIRROR. I WILL ASK
PEOPLE, WHAT DO YOU THINK I PAID
FOR THIS MIRROR? AND THEY WILL
TELL ME 1,500, $2,000. YOU KNOW
WHAT I PAID FOR IT? $450. IT
JUST MAKES THE WHOLE ROOM.
I NEEDED OUTDOOR FURNITURE.
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE A VERY LARGE
PATIO. THE LIST PRICE ON THEM
WAS APPROXIMATELY $13,000. I
PAID 5,000 AND CHANGE FOR THEM.
I WAS ABLE TO COORDINATE THE
FABRIC AND GET EXACTLY WHAT I
WANTED. THE SERVICE WAS GREAT, 
AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO
GO OUT OF THEIR WAY FOR YOU.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME--
SERVICE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE
SERVICE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
THE PRICE OF SOMETHING.
I FIGURE WITH THIS HOUSE AND
ALL, THAT I'VE SAVED OVER--
BETWEEN $100,000 AND $150,000.
Leisa: IF YOU'RE A HOMEOWNER,
YOU KNOW THE COST OF OWNING A
HOME GOES FAR BEYOND THE
PURCHASE PRICE OF YOUR HOUSE.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO REMODEL YOUR
KITCHEN, BUT ONCE YOU START
ADDING UP THE COST OF THINGS
LIKE CABINETS, COUNTERTOPS, AND
APPLIANCES, YOUR DREAM OF A NEW
KITCHEN SUDDENLY BECOMES NOTHING
MORE THAN JUST THAT. BUT IT'S
NOT THAT WAY ANYMORE, THANKS TO
DIRECTBUY. NOW YOU CAN HAVE THE
THINGS YOU WANT AND NEED FOR
YOUR HOME, ALL AT DIRECT,
INSIDER PRICES. HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAVE DONE
IT. SO CAN YOU. STOP DREAMING
THE DREAM AND BEGIN LIVING IT

INSIDERS WHO ARE ALREADY
ENJOYING THE MANY BENEFITS OF
BUYING DIRECT. THE LONGER YOU
WAIT, THE MORE MONEY YOU'RE
LOSING. SO CALL THE NUMBER ON

STOP GIVING YOUR MONEY AWAY.
THAT'S WHY DIRECTBUY IS
AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE WAY TO BUY

Narrator:
DO YOU MAKE FREQUENT TRIPS
TO THE BATHROOM?
SUFFER FROM URGENCY?
HESITANCY?
DO YOU GET UP MORE
THAN ONCE A NIGHT?
CAN YOU EVEN SIT
THROUGH A MOVIE?
OR, WORSE,
HAVE A DIMINISHED SEX DRIVE?
IF SO, CHANCES ARE
YOU HAVE AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.
...EVERY OTHER MAN
NOW WATCHING THIS SHOW
WILL SOMEDAY FACE THE SAME
PAINFUL PROBLEMS.
UNTIL NOW,
YOU HAD THREE CHOICES...
TAKE EXPENSIVE DRUGS
WITH POTENTIALLY
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS,
FACE PAINFUL
AND BLOODY SURGERY,
OR TRY TO LIVE WITH
THE PAIN AND EMBARRASSMENT.
INTRODUCING PROSVENT,
THE ALL-NATURAL SOLUTION
SO GOOD IT'S GUARANTEED
TO GIVE YOU RELIEF
IN LESS THAN 30 DAYS.
I EXPERIENCED WITHIN
THE FIRST TWO TO THREE DAYS
A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.
NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT
RUNNING TO A BATHROOM
IS UNBELIEVABLE.
WHEN I STARTED
TAKING THE PRODUCT,
AND I WASN'T GETTING UP
AT NIGHT, IT WAS GREAT.
I MEAN, THE REST
YOU GET AT NIGHT WAS GREAT.
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET UP.
IT JUST A LITTLE PILL I TAKE,
AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
I'M NOT RULED BY
GOING TO THE BATHROOM,
AND I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THOSE THINGS AGAIN.
I HADN'T SLEPT THROUGH
AN ENTIRE NIGHT...
MAYBE TEN YEARS.
IT WAS JUST REMARKABLE.
IT'S LIKE MY YOUTH.
I FEEL GREAT.
AND YOU CAN START FEELING
GREAT AGAIN, TOO,
WITHOUT HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS
AND WITHOUT PAINFUL SURGERY.
TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
WHAT THE PROSTATE IS,
WHAT IT DOES,
WHY IT CAUSES SO MANY PROBLEMS
FOR SO MANY MEN,
AND WHAT YOU CAN
FINALLY DO ABOUT IT
SIMPLY, EASILY, AND SAFELY.
THIS IS DR. LARRY MAY.
HE RECEIVED HIS MEDICAL DEGREE
FROM HARVARD,
IS A FACULTY MEMBER
AT THE UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
AND IS LISTED IN THIS BOOK: 
THE BEST DOCTORS IN AMERICA.
HE'S HELPED THOUSANDS
REVERSE AND CONTROL
THE PROBLEM
OF AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.
TODAY HE'LL HELP YOU.
DR. MAY, THE NUMBERS--
THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE.
HALF THE MEN OVER 50
IN THIS COUNTRY--
THAT'S 30 MILLION MEN SUFFERING
FROM AN ENLARGED PROSTATE?
BARBARA, THAT'S RIGHT.
EVERY MAN HAS A PROSTATE,
AND AS SURELY AS THEIR HAIR
IS GOING TO TURN GRAY,
THAT PROSTATE
IS GOING TO ENLARGE.
AND BY THE AGE OF 70,
80% OF MEN
WILL HAVE PROBLEMS.
AS MEN AGE, TESTOSTERONE,
THE MALE HORMONE,
IS CONVERTED TO
DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE,
A MUCH MORE POTENT VARIETY,
AND IT STIMULATES
THE PROSTATE CELLS
TO GROW AND MULTIPLY
AND THE PROSTATE TO ENLARGE.
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS
DOES THAT CAUSE?
AND VIRTUALLY EVERY MAN
IS GOING TO FACE THIS?
EVERY MAN HAS A PROSTATE.
AND IF A MAN LIVES LONG ENOUGH,
THEY'RE GOING TO
EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS.
LET'S BACK UP JUST A MINUTE.
WHAT IS THE PROSTATE,
AND WHY THE PROBLEM?
THE ONLY FUNCTION
OF THE PROSTATE
IS IT PROVIDES FLUID
TO TRANSPORT THE SPERM.
BUT, JUST LIKE IN REAL ESTATE,
LOCATION IS EVERYTHING.
AND THE PROBLEM IS
THE LOCATION OF THE PROSTATE.
HERE'S THE PROSTATE,
LOCATED JUST BELOW THE BLADDER
WHICH IS WHERE
THE URINE ACCUMULATES
AND THEN FLOWS THROUGH
THIS TUBE CALLED THE URETHRA.
THE PROSTATE
SURROUNDS THE URETHRA.
AND AS IT ENLARGES,
IT SQUEEZES THE URETHRA,
SLOWING THE FLOW OF URINE,
MUCH LIKE YOU CAN SEE
IN AN HOURGLASS.
THE SAND FLOWS THROUGH
JUST LIKE THE URINE
FLOWING THROUGH THE URETHRA.
AND THE PROSTATE SURROUNDS IT,
SLOWING THE FLOW,
AND ULTIMATELY STOPPING IT.
A DOCTOR CAN HELP BECAUSE
A DOCTOR PERFORMS AN EXAM
WE CALL A DIGITAL RECTAL EXAM,
AND HE CAN FEEL THE PROSTATE,
AND SAY, "HEY, YOUR PROSTATE
IS GETTING A LITTLE BIG."
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT USUALLY DOESN'T OCCUR
UNTIL THE 50's,
AND THE GROWTH OF THE PROSTATE
MAY BEGIN IN THE 30's.
AND UNLESS THE SYMPTOMS
ARE NOW DEBILITATING,
THE DOCTOR MAY NOT OFFER
ANY TREATMENT
OTHER THAN TO RULE OUT
A SERIOUS DISEASE.
TO WAIT UNTIL YOUR LIFE
REVOLVES AROUND THE BATHROOM
OR YOU LOSE YOUR SEX LIFE
IS NO LIFE AT ALL.
AND THEN IT'S BACK
TO THE DOCTOR.
BACK TO THE DOCTOR
FOR DRUG TREATMENT--
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS,
WHICH MAY RELIEVE THE SYMPTOMS,
BUT OFTEN THE SIDE EFFECTS
ARE WORSE--
DECREASED LIBIDO
AND EVEN IMPOTENCE.
PLUS THE PROSTATE
CAN CONTINUE TO GROW.
ULTIMATELY, THERE'S SURGERY.
BUT AT LEAST THE PROBLEMS
GO AWAY, RIGHT?
YES AND NO. THERE ARE
MANY TYPES OF SURGERIES,
AND THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN
PROBLEMS AND SIDE EFFECTS
AND OFTEN THEY NEED
TO BE REPEATED.
THERE'S THE GOLD STANDARD,
WHAT WE CALL A "TURP,"
OR TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION
OF THE PROSTATE.
FOR THIS WE USE AN INSTRUMENT
KNOWN AS A RESECTOSCOPE.
LOOKS SCARY!
IT IS.
AND IT'S A 12-INCH INSTRUMENT
THAT YOU INTRODUCE
THROUGH THE PENIS,
INTO THE AREA
WHERE THE PROSTATE IS,
AND THEN YOU SCRAPE AWAY
THE PROSTATE.
SCRAPE IT AWAY
IN ORDER TO CREATE
A NEW OPENING.
IT'S PAINFUL,
IT'S BLOODY.
IT REQUIRES
A HOSPITALIZATION.
BUT PATIENTS SUBMIT TO IT
BECAUSE UNTREATED,
THE ENLARGED PROSTATE CAN...
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT CAN HELP.
THIS IS PROSVENT.
IT CONTAINS NATURAL SUBSTANCES
AND MINERALS,
WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN
IN STUDY AFTER STUDY,
INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS,
TO REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS
OF AN ENLARGED PROSTATE,
PROMOTING PROSTATE HEALTH,
AND RETURNING MEN TO
A NORMAL EXISTENCE
IN LESS THAN 30 DAYS.
I LOVE DRIVING THE SCHOOL BUS.
I LOVE THE KIDS,
BUT YOU GOT KIDS ON THE BUS,
YOU CAN'T JUST--
YOU GOTTA GO--YOU CAN'T.
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA HAVE TO
GIVE UP DRIVING THE SCHOOL BUS.
AND SO WHEN THIS THING
CAME ABOUT,
I FIGURED THIS IS
SOMETHING I WANT TO TRY,
AND IT WORKED,
IT WORKED WITHIN A WEEK.
NOT HAVING TO WORRY
ABOUT RUNNING TO A BATHROOM
IS UNBELIEVABLE.
IT'S KIND OF CHANGED MY LIFE
TO WHAT IT USED TO BE.
IT'S BETTER THAN GREAT,
BECAUSE IT'S MADE
A DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE.
I'M SURPRISED IT WORKED
AND WORKED SO QUICKLY
BECAUSE WITHIN A WEEK AND A HALF
I WAS DOING FINE AFTER THAT.
I WASN'T GOING TO THE BATHROOM
DURING THE NIGHT.
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
THE URGE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,
AND YOU STAND THERE,
AND NOTHING'S COMING OUT.
THEN WHEN IT FINALLY COMES OUT,
IT TRICKLES OUT.
NOW, AFTER TAKING THE PILL, I'VE
NOTICED I GO LESS FREQUENTLY.
AND WHEN I DO HAVE TO GO,
IT JUST COMES OUT,
AND, BOOM, RIGHT BACK TO BED.
WHAT'S IN THIS?
IT'S THE MOST
COMPREHENSIVE FORMULA
THAT'S EVER BEEN DEVELOPED.
IT CONTAINS STINGING NETTLE.
THIS HERB HAS BEEN USED
FOR YEARS FOR PROSTATE
AND URINARY PROBLEMS.
EVEN FOR THE RELIEF OF PAIN
FROM URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS.
IT'S ESPECIALLY HELPFUL
IN RELIEVING FREQUENT URINATION,
PARTICULARLY OVERNIGHT.
PYGEUM AFRICANUM--
ALSO FOUND TO REDUCE
FREQUENCY AND URGENCY.
PUMPKINSEED OIL
CONTRIBUTES ADDITIONAL
STEROLS.
SAW PALMETTO TO INHIBIT
THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERONE
TO DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE,
THE ROOT CAUSE
OF PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT.
ACTING TOGETHER
AND IN CONCERT, THEY:
LYCOPENE--A NUTRIENT
ANTI-OXIDANT DERIVED
FROM TOMATOES.
SELENIUM IS AN ANTI-OXIDANT
MINERAL WHICH PROTECTS 
THE CELLS,
AND IT WORKS SYNERGISTICALLY
WITH VITAMIN E,
A POWERFUL ANTI-OXIDANT;
AND THEN THERE'S
VITAMIN D AND ZINC
WHICH HELP CONTRIBUTE
TO OVERALL PROSTATE HEALTH.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
A COMBINATION OF INGREDIENTS
TOGETHER IN A FORMULATION
SO EFFECTIVE IN ELIMINATING
THE DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS.
I'M VERY HAPPY
TO BE ABLE TO BE
NORMAL AGAIN.
I DID THINK OF IT
AS AN OLD MAN'S PROBLEM.
FOR ME TO HAVE IT AT 40
INSTEAD OF 60...
WAS A LITTLE ALARMING.
AFTER THE FIRST WEEK,
I NOTICED I DIDN'T HAVE TO STOP
WHAT I WAS DOING AT WORK.
I COULD CONTINUE WORKING.
THIS IS WONDERFUL STUFF,
REMARKABLE STUFF.
I WISH SOMEONE
HAD TOLD ME ABOUT IT SOONER.
I WENT FROM
THREE TO FOUR TIMES A NIGHT
TO ONCE A NIGHT GETTING UP.
IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT,
AND IT WORKS.
I'D BEEN GETTING UP
LIKE TWO OR THREE TIMES A NIGHT,
SOMETIMES FOUR TIMES A NIGHT,
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
A DIRE URGENCY TO GET THERE,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
NOT MUCH HAPPENS.
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT
I WAS WAKING UP ONCE.
AND THEN A COUPLE WEEKS LATER,
A WHOLE NIGHT'S SLEEP.
WHOA! HOW WONDERFUL!
I WANT EVERY MAN WATCHING
RIGHT NOW
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS:
IN THE LAST MONTH,
HAVE YOU HAD THE SENSATION
OF NOT EMPTYING YOUR BLADDER
COMPLETELY?
DO YOU URINATE LESS THAN
TWO HOURS AFTER YOU'VE
JUST FINISHED?
DO YOU START AND STOP
SEVERAL TIMES WHILE URINATING?
DO YOU HAVE
A WEAK URINE STREAM?
WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO,
DO YOU FEEL AN URGENCY
LIKE YOU MIGHT
HAVE AN ACCIDENT?
DO YOU STRAIN OR PUSH?
AND FINALLY, DO YOU GET UP
TWO OR MORE TIMES A NIGHT?
IF YOU ANSWER YES
TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS,
YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE
AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.
AND IF YOU'VE ANSWERED YES
TO MORE THAN ONE,
YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT NOW!
AND PROSVENT CAN HELP?
PROSVENT CAN ABSOLUTELY HELP,
AND IT DOES IT
WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS.
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CAN HELP,
BUT DO IT WITH SIDE EFFECTS
THAT MAY DIMINISH YOUR SEX LIFE.
AND, SURGERY, WHILE IT CAN
SOMETIMES HELP,
CAN BE BLOODY, DANGEROUS,
AND OFTEN HAS TO BE REPEATED.
HOW LONG TILL
THEY START SEEING CHANGES?
MANY MEN WILL SEE
CHANGES WITHIN TWO WEEKS.
BUT MOST
WILL EXPERIENCE BENEFITS
WITHIN 30 DAYS.
IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE
SUFFERS FROM
THE SYMPTOMS
OF AN ENLARGED PROSTATE,
FREQUENT URINATION, URGENCY,
HESITANCY, REDUCED FLOW,
PUSHING OR STRAINING, PAIN,
OR A DIMINISHED SEX DRIVE,
PICK UP THE PHONE NOW.
GET YOUR LIFE BACK.
DO YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE
MAKE TOO MANY TRIPS
TO THE BATHROOM?
SUFFER FROM URGENCY
THAT IS HARD TO CONTROL?
HAVE A WEAK STREAM
OR FIND IT DIFFICULT
TO START AND STOP?
DO YOU GET UP
MORE THAN ONCE A NIGHT?
OR FIND IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
TO SIT THROUGH A MOVIE?
WORSE, YET,
IS A DIMINISHED SEX DRIVE
DESTROYING YOUR LIFE?
IF YOU ANSWERED YES TO MORE
THAN ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS,
YOU ARE PROBABLY ONE
OF THE 30 MILLION MEN
WHO SUFFER FROM
AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.
UNTIL NOW
YOU HAD THREE CHOICES:
TAKE EXPENSIVE DRUGS
WITH POTENTIALLY
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS.
SUFFER PAINFUL
AND BLOODY SURGERY
THAT OFTEN MUST BE REPEATED.
OR TRY AND LIVE WITH IT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE
WITH IT ANYMORE.

IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
THAT MEN SHOULD START
USING PROSVENT
WAY BEFORE SYMPTOMS
START TO APPEAR.
ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE
THE PROSTATE BEGINS TO GROW
LONG BEFORE SYMPTOMS.
HERE'S OUR NORMAL WALNUT-SIZE
PROSTATE IN THE 20's.
NO SYMPTOMS.
BY THE 30's, THERE'S
OFTEN ENLARGEMENT OCCURRING
BUT STILL NO SYMPTOMS.
BY THE 40's AND 50's,
THE ENLARGEMENT CONTINUES,
BUT NOW SYMPTOMS
BEGIN TO OCCUR.
THE PROSTATE
SQUEEZES THE URETHRA,
SLOWS THE URINE,
ULTIMATELY STOPPING
THE URINE FLOW.
Dr. May: RECENTLY I SAT
WITH A GROUP OF MEN
WHO'D BEEN EXPERIENCING
SOME OF THOSE SYMPTOMS.
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
THEY TALKED IN A GROUP.
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST NIGHT
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET UP
FOUR OR FIVE TIMES.
I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF
JUST TWO OR THREE NIGHTS AGO--
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE
TO EXPERIENCE AN 8-HOUR
UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP?
WHEN YOU GET TO
A CERTAIN POINT--
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
BEING A DRUG ADDICT
WHERE YOU'RE WORRYING
ABOUT YOUR NEXT DRUG.
I'M WORRYING ABOUT
WHERE THE NEXT BATHROOM IS.
IF I'M ON A PLANE
IN THE AISLE SEAT--
THE WORST ONE WAS
I TOOK MY SON
TO GO SEE THE LAST
LORD OF THE RINGS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A 2-HOUR MOVIE.
I MAKE THE TWO HOURS
ON THE NOSE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THIS THING'S GOING.
I'M GOING, "OH, NO!"
YOU'RE GOING,
"THROW THE RING!
THROW THE RING!"
PLEASE CUT ME--
IS THIS THE END?
I'M VERY HAPPY
MY WIFE IS AN R.N.
SHE WORKED IN A HOSPITAL
AND SHE USED TO GET
THE URINE CAPS.
PUT IT IN THE TRUNK.
I'D REACH DOWN.
HELLO. YEAH, YEAH.
HOW'S EVERYTHING?
OH, YEAH, SURE, FINE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS NORMAL
TO PEE TWO OR THREE TIMES
A NIGHT.
MY DOCTOR WOULD SAY,
"YOU'RE NOT 21 ANYMORE."
I JUST SORT OF
WROTE IT OFF AS THAT.
UNTIL FINALLY HE SAID,
"JUST HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GOING?"
I SAID, "FIVE, SIX,
SOMETIMES SEVEN."
YOU GOT UP FIVE, SIX,
SEVEN TIMES A NIGHT?
YOU DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS
SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT
EVERY HOUR? DID YOU SLEEP?
I THOUGHT
WHAT GOES IN GOES OUT.
ARE WE THAT STUPID
OR THAT EMBARRASSED
OVER SOMETHING WE SHOULDN'T
BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT?
All: YEAH!
I THINK EMBARRASSED
AND LIVING IN DENIAL.
WE NOTICE THESE CHANGES
SO SUBTLY
THAT THEY DON'T REALLY REGISTER,
AND THAT'S WHY
WE ALWAYS BECOME AWARE
OF A PROBLEM WHEN IT'S TOO LATE.
TRUTH IS NOW
I START MENTIONING IT
TO MY FRIENDS.
WHEN I'M STANDING AT THE URINAL
AND THERE'S A GUY
STANDING NEXT TO ME,
AND HE'S SLOWER THAN I AM,
I ASK HIM HOW LONG
HIS PROSTATE'S BEEN ENLARGED.
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
IT'S A GREAT PICK-UP LINE.
ABSOLUTELY.
IN THE JOHN--
THEY LOVE ME FOR THAT!
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU
STARTED TAKING PROSVENT?
IT PROBABLY TOOK 10 DAYS
TO TWO WEEKS
BEFORE I REALLY STARTED KNOWING.
INSTEAD OF THREE TIMES A NIGHT,
I MIGHT GET UP ONCE NOW.
AND I HAD ONE OR TWO NIGHTS
WHERE I DIDN'T GET UP AT ALL.
I HADN'T SLEPT THROUGH
AN ENTIRE NIGHT
IN MAYBE TEN YEARS.
I LIKE IT.
I'M TAKING IT.
I'M VERY HAPPY.
I'M THRILLED BEYOND COMPARE.
I TAKE THE STUFF,
AND, HEY, I'LL SLEEP
ALL NIGHT LONG.
I JUST WENT ON A TRIP.
MY WIFE AND I SAID,
LET'S GET AWAY
BEFORE THE HOLIDAY.
SO WE HAD TO SIT IN THE CAR.
BEFORE I STARTED TAKING--
I WOULD'VE HAD A FIT.
BUT I WAS OKAY.
I WAS REALLY SURPRISED.
SAY SIX,
SEVEN MONTHS AGO...NO.
SO, I LOVE IT.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
WHEN SHOULD YOU START
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THIS?
THE FIRST SIGN OF ANY SYMPTOMS--
THAT IS, THAT YOUR
URINARY STREAM HAS GOTTEN
A LITTLE NARROWER,
OR YOU WAKE UP ONCE A NIGHT,
OR YOU FIND THAT
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH
THE WHOLE MOVIE--
THAT'S WHEN YOU ABSOLUTELY
SHOULD START TREATING IT
SO YOU DON'T PROGRESS
TO THREE OR FOUR TIMES
WAKENING AT NIGHT.
FOR ME IT'S REMARKABLE
BECAUSE I FOUND IT TO BE
PROBABLY ONE OF THE--
MAYBE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
LIFE-STYLE ALTERING THINGS.
AND THAT'S HUGE.
HAVING GONE THROUGH
WHAT I'VE GONE THROUGH,
HAD THAT BEEN AVAILABLE
WHEN I WAS IN MY MID-20's,
I CERTAINLY WOULD'VE
TALKED TO MY DOCTOR ABOUT IT.
I WOULDN'T WISH
WHAT I'VE GONE THROUGH
ON ANYBODY.
IF NO ONE TAKES ANYTHING ELSE
AWAY FROM THIS SHOW,
I WANT THEM TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON
BECAUSE BEING SILENT
IS BEING STUPID.
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE STUPID ANYMORE.
TELL US AGAIN
ABOUT WHAT'S IN PROSVENT.
PROSVENT HAS A UNIQUE
COMBINATION OF NATURAL
SUBSTANCES AND MINERALS
THAT BOTH HELP
ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS
AND PROTECT
THE PROSTATE'S HEALTH.
BUT WE WANTED AN EVEN MORE
COMPREHENSIVE FORMULA.
SO TO ALL THAT WE ADDED...
BEFORE I DID ANYTHING,
I'D ALWAYS GO TO THE RESTROOM--
LEAVE THE HOUSE,
GO TO THE RESTROOM.
WHEN YOU GET TO
THE NEXT DESTINATION,
GO TO THE RESTROOM.
I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED THAT
SINCE I'VE BEEN TAKING THE PILL.
IT DEFINITELY HAS IMPROVED
MY DAILY ROUTINE
AND THE QUALITY OF MY LIFE.
IT HAPPENS
EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS.
AS I SAID, I GET UP
AND GO TO THE RESTROOM,
COME BACK TO BED,
AND I HAVE PROBLEMS
TO GO BACK TO SLEEP.
NOW, AFTER TAKING THIS PILL
FOR TWO WEEKS,
IT HELPS ME A LOT.
I THINK I WILL BE
MORE PRODUCTIVE AND MORE RESTFUL
DURING THE DAY ALSO.
IF SOMEBODY HAD
THE SAME SYMPTOMS
THAT I HAD,
I WOULD TELL THEM
TO TRY THIS PRODUCT.
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO BE AN IDIOT LIKE I WAS.
HE WAS ON A CONSTANT SEARCH
FOR WHATEVER BATHROOM
HE COULD GET TO
IN WHATEVER QUICK
AMOUNT OF TIME
HE COULD GET THERE.
AND THIS HAS ENABLED HIM
TO SEE
LIFE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.
IT MADE MY HUSBAND
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON.
AND I'M NOT CRABBY EITHER
BECAUSE HE KEPT WAKING ME UP
EVERY TIME HE WOULD GET UP.
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR HIM,
AND I'M HAPPY FOR ME TOO.
FOR MANY TIME,
WAKE UP AT NIGHT.
FIVE OR SIX TIMES AT NIGHT,
AND EVEN FOR ONLY
A FEW DROPS.
AND I HAVE TO GO.
I CANNOT HOLD.
MY LIFE IS A LOT BETTER NOW.
IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.
CHANGED MY LIFE.
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN
I DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT
TO A BATHROOM SOMETIMES
SOME PLACES.
BUT, NOW, I CAN'T--I CAN'T--
I JUST CAN'T GET OVER
HOW--HOW GREAT THESE PILLS WORK.
THE BEST THING
ABOUT TAKING PROSVENT IS
NOT ONLY DO I NOT HAVE TO GET UP
THREE OR FOUR TIMES A NIGHT,
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE DRUGS.
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE TO ORDER.
YOU REALLY CAN
CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOR THE BETTER.
AND STILL AHEAD,
WE HAVE CALLERS
WITH QUESTIONS FOR DR. MAY.
DO YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE
MAKE TOO MANY TRIPS
TO THE BATHROOM?

OR FIND IT DIFFICULT
TO START AND STOP?
DO YOU GET UP
MORE THAN ONCE A NIGHT?
OR FIND IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE

WORSE YET,
IS A DIMINISHED SEX DRIVE
DESTROYING YOUR LIFE?

THAN ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS,
YOU ARE PROBABLY ONE

AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

DR. MAY,
WE HAVE SOME CALLERS
ON THE LINE
WITH QUESTIONS.
CHRIS, IN ROCHESTER,
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
I'M JUST BEGINNING TO SEE
SOME OF THESE HAPPEN,
AND I'M A LITTLE SCARED.
HOW QUICKLY IS THIS
GOING TO GET WORSE,
AND CAN I REVERSE
WHAT'S STARTED?
NOBODY CAN TELL YOU
HOW QUICKLY YOUR SYMPTOMS
ARE GOING TO PROGRESS.
WE CAN ONLY TELL YOU
THAT WITH TIME
THEY WILL GET WORSE.
BUT IF YOU START PROSVENT,
IT HAS THE INGREDIENTS
THAT WILL REVERSE THAT PROCESS.
AND FROM THE DAY YOU START,
THE HEALING WILL BEGIN.
OUR NEXT CALLER
IS LOU FROM NEW YORK.
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION
FOR THE DOCTOR?
HI. YES, DOCTOR,
I'M 62 YEARS OLD.
AND I'M HAVING
SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS
YOU'RE DISCUSSING TODAY.
CAN SOME OF THESE LEAD
TO CANCER?
LOU, THE SIMPLE ANSWER
IS NO.
BUT THE MAN OF 62, WHO HAS
BENIGN PROSTATIC ENLARGEMENT,
IS ALSO THE MAN
WHO IS AT RISK FOR CANCER.
REMEMBER, I ENCOURAGE
EVERY MAN AT THE AGE OF 50...
YOU'VE GOT TO RULE OUT CANCER--
THEN PROSVENT CAN HELP
ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEMS
OF AN ENLARGED PROSTATE
AND INCREASE YOUR
OVERALL PROSTATE HEALTH.
AND NO SIDE EFFECTS.
THESE INGREDIENTS
HAVE BEEN STUDIED
COUNTLESS TIMES

AND NO SIDE EFFECTS.
I'M GLAD TO SAY
WE HAVE A WOMAN ON THE LINE.
FRANCINE FROM PHILADELPHIA,
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION
FOR DR. MAY?
I'M REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT MY HUSBAND.
HE SAYS HE'S FINE, BUT I KNOW
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH HIM
BECAUSE HE GETS UP
ALL NIGHT LONG
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
AND WHEN HE GOES
TO THE BATHROOM,
HE'S IN THERE FOREVER.
HE SAYS NOTHING WRONG
BECAUSE HIS PH--PS--
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT--
PSA IS NEGATIVE.
AND HE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
FRANCINE, YOU'VE
GOT TO TALK TO HIM.
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S
UNLIKELY THAT HE HAS CANCER--
THAT'S WHAT THE PSA MEANS,
BUT THOSE SYMPTOMS ARE HORRIBLE.
AND THEY'RE INTERFERING
WITH HIS LIFE AND YOURS.
AND YOU'VE GOT TO PERSUADE HIM
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT CAN BE DONE,
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
LIVE WITH THOSE SYMPTOMS.
THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF HOW IT NOT ONLY AFFECTS
THE MAN BUT HIS LOVED ONE TOO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MEN JUST
THINK THIS IS GOING TO GO AWAY.
FRANCINE, IF YOU'RE
STILL THERE,
YOU'VE GOT TO PICK UP THE PHONE
AND ORDER THIS FOR HIM.
PUT IT DOWN
AND MAKE HIM TAKE IT.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA
ONLY HELP HIM,
IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP
BEFORE IT GETS
ANY BIGGER PROBLEMS.
AND HE'S GOING TO BE
GRATEFUL FOR YOUR HELP.
WE HAVE TIME FOR
ONE MORE CALLER, DR. MAY.
NEIL FROM LOS ANGELES.
HOW ARE YOU DOING, NEIL?
YOU HAVE A QUESTION?
I'VE BEEN HAVING THESE SYMPTOMS
THAT YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBING
FOR MANY YEARS NOW,
AND I'VE TRIED A LOT OF THINGS.
WHY NOT JUST HAVE
THE PROSTATE REMOVED?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
NEIL, YOUR BODY
IS NOT LIKE A CAR.
YOU CAN'T JUST
CHANGE THE OIL FILTER.
YOU MAY BE TRADING
A BAD PROBLEM
FOR A WORSE ONE.
IF YOU HAVE
YOUR PROSTATE REMOVED,
YOU RUN THE RISK
OF DAMAGING THE NERVES
AND WINDING UP INCONTINENT,
IMPOTENT.
IT IS NOT THE TREATMENT
OF CHOICE.
IT IS TRULY YOUR LAST RESORT.
WE ONLY HAVE
A COUPLE MINUTES LEFT.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT YOU WANT TO ADD?
THE PROBLEM OF
AN ENLARGED PROSTATE
IS INEVITABLE.
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO EVERY MAN LISTENING
OUT THERE TODAY.
SO FAR IT'S BEEN
A SILENT EPIDEMIC.
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO TALK ABOUT IT.
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.
DON'T WAIT UNTIL
THE PROBLEMS OVERTAKE YOUR LIFE.
IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY
OF PROSTATE PROBLEMS
OR HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS,
SUCH AS FREQUENT URINATION
URGENCY, HESITANCY,
GETTING UP FREQUENTLY AT NIGHT,
PAIN OR DISCOMFORT
WHEN URINATING,
OR A DIMINISHED SEX DRIVE,
TRY PROSVENT TODAY.
GET BACK YOUR LIFE.
FOR DR. MAY AND MYSELF,
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
AND BE WELL.
I HAD RUN OUT OF THE SAMPLES
AT ONE TIME,
AND I NOTICED GOING BACK TO
GETTING UP ONCE A NIGHT,
THEN TWICE A NIGHT.
THAT'S WHEN I REALLY REALIZED
THAT THIS PRODUCT WAS WORKING
AND THAT I SHOULD
CONTINUE TAKING IT.
GOING TO BED AND BEING ABLE
TO GET A FULL NIGHT'S SLEEP,
GET UP IN THE MORNING,
AND MAKE BELIEVE
I'M A RACE HORSE
WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
I WANT TO BE HEALTHY,
AND I AM.
MAYBE I'M A LITTLE OVERWEIGHT,
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I EAT
TOO MANY COOKIES.

AND BEAUTIFUL ISN'T ALWAYS
THAT EASY.
AGING, COFFEE, TEA AND SOFT
DRINKS, EVEN CERTAIN FOODS CAN
STAIN YOUR TEETH.
AND IF YOU SMOKE, YOU PROBABLY
KNOW THAT YOUR TEETH COULD BE
A LOT WHITER.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
THE DRUGSTORES AND SUPERMARKETS
HAVE AISLES FULL OF PRODUCTS
THAT PROMISE TO WHITEN YOUR
TEETH, BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY.
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS GOING
TO THE DENTIST.
THEY HAVE MESSY TRAY SYSTEMS
THAT NEED TO BE CUSTOM-FITTED
AND COST $300 TO $400 OR MORE.
AND THE GELS AND SOLUTIONS THEY
USE CAN CAUSE
SEVERE SENSITIVITY.
THE MOST ADVANCED WHITENING
TECHNIQUES DENTISTS ARE USING
TODAY COMBINE HIGHLY
CONCENTRATED HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
SOLUTIONS WITH LIGHT THERAPY.
IT'S BEEN A SECRET OF
CELEBRITIES AND THE WEALTHY
FOR A WHILE.
THIS PROCESS DOES GIVE
YOU RESULTS.
YOU CAN GO SHADES LIGHTER WITH
ABOUT AN HOUR WORTH OF
LIGHT TREATMENT.
BUT THESE TREATMENTS CAN COST
$500 OR MORE.
WHAT IF YOU COULD GET DENTIST
OFFICE RESULTS WITHOUT GOING TO
THE DENTIST?
THAT'S RIGHT, NO DENTIST.
I MEAN UP TO SIX SHADES LIGHTER
OR MORE, WITH NO SENSITIVITY,
IN UNDER AN HOUR AND
AT A FRACTION OF THE COST.
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE THOSE
DAZZLING WHITE TEETH YOU'VE
ALWAYS WANTED WITH THE FIRST
IN-HOME LIGHT WHITENING SYSTEM,
KLEAR ACTION WHITENING LIGHT.
>> YOU COULD GO TO A DENTIST AND
SPEND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
DOLLARS, BUT YOU COULD USE
THE WHITENING LIGHT SYSTEM
IN THE COMFORT AND PRIVACY OF
YOUR OWN HOME AND STILL GET YOUR
TEETH EIGHT SHADES WHITER.
>> I'VE SEEN LIGHT THERAPY
IN THE DENTIST'S OFFICE.
IT WAS TIME-CONSUMING AND
VERY EXPENSIVE.
NOW I HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO
THIS IN MY OWN HOME.
IT'S CONVENIENT; IT'S QUICK.
WHITENING LIGHT IS
A FANTASTIC PRODUCT.
>> WELL, USING THE WHITENING
LIGHT ALLOWED ME TO BE ABLE TO
DO THIS IN MY OWN HOME AND NOT
HAVE TO GO TO
THE DENTIST'S OFFICE.
AND THEY CHARGE A LOT MORE
MONEY, SO I WAS HAPPY TO
DO IT MYSELF.
IN UNDER AN HOUR, I GOT THIS
BEAUTIFUL, BRIGHT, WHITE SMILE.
>> A LOT OF PRODUCTS THESE DAYS
CLAIM THEY'RE REVOLUTIONARY, BUT
THE WHITENING LIGHT TOOTH
WHITENING SYSTEM BY ACTIVA
TRULY IS.
THE CREATOR BEHIND
THIS AMAZING PRODUCT
IS DR. GRAHAM PHILP.
HE'S A DENTIST WITH OVER
30 YEARS OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCE.
TOGETHER WITH HIS RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT TEAM, HE'S COMBINED
TRADITIONAL, EFFECTIVE WHITENING
METHODS WITH BREAKTHROUGH DENTAL
WHITENING TECHNOLOGY THAT'S
UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT'S EVER BEEN
AVAILABLE FOR HOME USE.
>> I WANTED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM
THAT WOULD GIVE PEOPLE
THE BENEFIT OF HAVING WHITE
TEETH IN AN HOUR, SIMILAR TO
WHAT THEY COULD GET IN A DENTAL
OFFICE, AT HOME, WITHOUT
THE COST.
THE SAFETY ISSUE WAS AN
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ASPECT
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE KLEAR
ACTION WHITENING LIGHT SYSTEM.
WE'VE HAD, UH, CLINICAL STUDIES
BY, UM, RENOWNED CONSUMER
PRODUCT TESTING COMPANIES, AND
IN ALL THE STUDIES, WE'VE HAD
ZERO SENSITIVITY AND WE'VE SEEN
UP TO SIX SHADES IN
UNDER ONE HOUR.
THIS IS A VERY EXCITING TIME FOR
THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING LIGHT
SYSTEM, IN THAT OUR SYSTEM IS
THE FIRST CONSUMER-BASED PRODUCT
THAT IS CLEARED BY THE FDA.
WE HAVE SENT THE KLEAR ACTION
WHITENING LIGHT SYSTEM OUT TO
MANY DENTISTS.
AND THE DENTISTS REPORT THAT
THEY ARE GETTING VERY, VERY GOOD
RESULTS, WITHOUT ANY TOOTH
SENSITIVITY, FOR A FRACTION OF
THE COST, WHICH ALLOWS MANY MORE
PEOPLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
HAVING WHITE TEETH VERY RAPIDLY,
AND THEY'RE VERY HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.
>> I THINK YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH
RESEARCH AND TESTING HAS GONE
INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE WHITENING LIGHT TOOTH
WHITENING SYSTEM.
BUT WE DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS
ENOUGH TO PROVE JUST HOW
EFFECTIVE THIS INCREDIBLE NEW
PRODUCT IS, SO WE DID OUR
OWN TEST.
WE BROUGHT A DIVERSE GROUP OF
PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SEE FIRSTHAND
WHAT KIND OF RESULTS
THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING LIGHT
COULD PROVIDE.
DR. PHILP WAS ACTUALLY THERE TO
INSTRUCT THEM ON HOW IT WORKS
AND TO PROFESSIONALLY ASSESS
THEIR BEGINNING SHADE USING
AN INDUSTRY STANDARD TOOTH
SHADE GUIDE.
THE RESULTS WERE NOTHING SHORT
OF AMAZING.
>> I MEAN, ONE HOUR TO GO
FIVE SHADES, AFTER ALL
THE TIME AND MONEY I'VE SPENT
TRYING TO GET MY TEETH WHITER.
IT'S JUST-- IT'S AMAZING.
>> IT FEELS LIKE IT'S SPARKLING.
IT REALLY FEELS LIKE
IT'S SPARKLING.
>> I MEAN, YOU SEE IT
RIGHT AWAY.
THE FIRST TIME I DID IT, I WAS
LIKE, "NEVER MIND."
>> I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING THAT
YOU JUST TAKE HOME AND DO
YOURSELF TO REALLY WORK AS WELL
AS IT DID.
>> I TRIED THE TRAYS,
THEN I HAD BRACES,
THEN I TRIED THE STRIPS, AND
NOTHING'S WORKED LIKE THIS.
>> IT REALLY JUST CLEANS UP MY
SMILE SO MUCH MORE.
SO I'M JUST SO EXCITED.
>> Tylo: IN THIS GROUP ALONE, WE
SAW AN INCREDIBLE AVERAGE OF
SEVEN SHADES LIGHTER
WITH THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING
LIGHT SYSTEM, AND EACH ONE
IN UNDER AN HOUR.
AND WHAT'S REALLY AMAZING IS
THAT SOME WENT AS HIGH AS
10 SHADES LIGHTER.
>> Dr. Philp: AND THAT IS
ONE, TWO... THAT'S A RECORD.
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 10.
>> 10.
>> Both: 10 SHADES.
>> KLEAR ACTION 
>> WE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO MEET
SOME OF OUR TEST PARTICIPANTS
RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH BEACH
WHERE IT ALL STARTED.
PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT YOUR
EXPERIENCE, NANCY.
>> I WENT SIX SHADES WHITER,
SO I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT.
>> Tylo: SIX SHADES WHITER.
>> Nancy: YES.
BEFORE THAT, I HAD TRIED OTHER
PRODUCTS THAT DID SENSITIZE MY
TEETH, AND THIS DIDN'T DO IT
AT ALL.
>> Man: I'VE TRIED
OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS.
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY SUCCESS.
>> Tylo: WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT
THE WHITENING LIGHT?
>> DO IT AT YOUR OWN PACE.
UNDER AN HOUR, I WENT 10 SHADES.
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED WITH...
>> OH, YEAH, I WAS SKEPTICAL.
>> YOU HAD SIX SHADES
OF DIFFERENCE.
>> YOU KNOW, AT FIRST, TO BE IN
THE TEST GROUP, I WAS KIND OF
LIKE, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?
BUT ACTUALLY, AFTER USING IT,
I MEAN, I WAS SHOCKED.
I HAD LITERALLY, EACH TIME
I DID IT, I WAS LIKE, "WOW."
THERE WAS A REALLY
BIG DIFFERENCE.
>> Nancy: IF YOU START ANY OTHER
REGIMEN, THEN PEOPLE WILL EXPECT
TO WAIT TO SEE RESULTS,
AND WITH THIS, IT'S
LIKE I DID THIS TODAY, AND
PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU, AND THEY'RE
LIKE, "WOW."
>> HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO
USE THE PRODUCT?
>> OH, UNDER 45 MINUTES, AND
I GOT SIX SHADES LIGHTER.
>> Tylo: SIX SHADES LIGHTER.
WHAT SHE HAD WAS A COUPLE OF
CAPS ON THE FRONT TEETH, BUT
THE ONES ON THE SIDE WERE
GETTING EXTREMELY DISCOLORED...
>> RIGHT.
>> AND YELLOWED OR BROWNED...
FROM DRINKING COFFEE AND TEA
AND WHATNOT. >> EXACTLY.
I WOULD ALWAYS CATCH MYSELF
PUTTING MY HAND IN FRONT OF MY
FACE, BUT I COULDN'T REALLY
AFFORD TO GET THEM DONE
AT THE DENTIST'S OFFICE, AND
I TRIED EVERYTHING.
>> Tylo: DIFFERENT CASE WITH
WHITENING LIGHT?
>> MY TEETH HAD GONE SIX SHADES.
>> THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
>> IT IS, IT'S INCREDIBLE.
AND NOW I REALLY HAVE SOMETHING
TO SMILE ABOUT.
>> I MEAN, WE'VE ALL, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS TO
TRY AND GET THE WHITE TEETH, AND
THIS IS JUST THE QUICKEST AND
THE EASIEST AND THE MOST
PAINLESS WAY TO DO IT.
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING
HERE TODAY.
YOU CAN SEE HOW HAPPY AND
ENTHUSIASTIC THESE PEOPLE
REALLY ARE.
THEY HAVE USED THE PRODUCT, AND
THEY LOVE IT.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE TRIED
THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING
LIGHT, AND THEY HAVE EQUALLY
OUTSTANDING RESULTS TO TELL
YOU ABOUT.
>> I NEVER THOUGHT THAT A LIGHT
COULD GET MY TEETH SO WHITE AND
BRIGHT, ESPECIALLY SEVEN SHADES
LIGHTER, AND IT WAS JUST ALL IN
UNDER ONE HOUR.
>> I WAS VERY AMAZED THAT IN
UNDER AN HOUR I COULD GET MY
TEETH NINE SHADES WHITER.
[LAUGHS]
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT.
>> KLEAR ACTION WHITENING LIGHT
I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
IT WHITENED MY TEETH BEYOND WHAT
I EVER THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD
BE WHITENED.
I DON'T WANT TO STOP SMILING.
>> IMAGINE HOW GREAT YOU'D LOOK
AND FEEL IF YOU COULD HAVE
BRIGHTER, WHITER AND SEXIER
TEETH LIKE THOSE PEOPLE.
WELL, YOU CAN WITH KLEAR ACTION

KLEAR ACTION WHITENING LIGHT

WHEN YOU COMPARE THE WHITENING
LIGHT TO ANY OF THE OTHER
WHITENING SYSTEMS CURRENTLY

ISN'T ANY COMPARISON.
WHAT'S A BEAUTIFUL, DAZZLING
SMILE WORTH TO YOU?
WOULD YOU PAY HUNDREDS OF
DOLLARS AT THE DENTIST'S OFFICE

SENSITIVITY SO MANY
PEOPLE EXPERIENCE?

UP TO SIX SHADES LIGHTER.
IN JUST THREE SIMPLE AND FAST
STEPS, YOU CAN FINALLY HAVE
THE BRIGHT, WHITE, SEXY SMILE
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR, ALL

WE JUST HAD TO LET OUR CAMERAS
ROLL TO SEE THE FIRST REACTIONS
OF PEOPLE RIGHT AFTER THEIR
WHITENING LIGHT TREATMENT.
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.
>> OH, THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> THEY'RE SO WHITE.
>> THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. [LAUGHS]
>> ARE THESE MY TEETH?
>> I'M SHOCKED.
>> I'M TICKLED. [LAUGHS]
IT'S GREAT.
>> FANTASTIC.
>> THAT'S AMAZING.
>> I LIKE IT.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW MY FRIENDS.
>> WHEN I FIRST SAW MYSELF
IN THE MIRROR... [LAUGHS] IT WAS
AN UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT A LIGHT
CAN MAKE YOUR TEETH SO WHITE.
>> THE FIRST TIME I SAW MY TEETH
AFTER USING WHITENING LIGHT,
I HAD TO TAKE A DOUBLE GLANCE,
'CAUSE I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH,
AM I ACTUALLY REALLY
SEEING THIS?"
THEY WERE SO WHITE.
IT WAS AMAZING.
>> WHEN I FIRST LOOKED
IN THE MIRROR AFTER USING
WHITENING LIGHT, I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT WAS ME.
MY MOUTH WAS SHINING, MY TEETH
WERE GLISTENING, I WAS JUST
SO HAPPY.
>> THE BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY
OF THE WHITENING LIGHT SYSTEM
WAS DEVELOPED BY AN INCREDIBLE
COMPANY NAMED ACTIVA.
THEY'VE BEEN DEVELOPING DENTAL
PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES THAT
HAVE BEEN USED FOR YEARS
IN THOUSANDS OF DENTAL OFFICES
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES,
AND THROUGH EXTENSIVE TESTING
BY ONE OF THE TOP INDEPENDENT
DENTAL TESTING FACILITIES,
THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING LIGHT
SYSTEM HAS BEEN CLINICALLY
PROVEN TO GET YOU UP TO SIX
SHADES LIGHTER OR MORE WITHOUT
ANY TOOTH SENSITIVITY,
ALL IN UNDER AN HOUR.
>> THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING
SYSTEM AND THE IN-OFFICE
WHITENING SYSTEM WILL GIVE
THE SAME RESULTS.
BOTH THE IN-OFFICE WHITENING
SYSTEM AND THE KLEAR ACTION
WHITENING LIGHT SYSTEM USE
THE SAME WHITENING AGENT.
IN ADDITION, THE LIGHT
TECHNOLOGY IS THE SAME
FOR BOTH SYSTEMS.
HOWEVER, MY PATIENTS PREFER THE
KLEAR ACTION SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY
DON'T HAVE TO COME TO MY OFFICE,
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE PAIN OR THE SENSITIVITY, AND
THEY CAN APPLY IT
AT THEIR LEISURE.
USING THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING
LIGHT SYSTEM, I'VE SEEN VERY
DRAMATIC RESULTS FROM PATIENTS,
MANY ACHIEVING SIX SHADES OR
MORE WHITER IN UNDER AN HOUR.
PEOPLE MAY THINK THE KLEAR
ACTION WHITENING SYSTEM, BECAUSE
IT'S SO FAST, IS HARMFUL.
IT IS NOT.
IT IS COMPLETELY SAFE.
WE'VE HAD NO REPORTS OF
SENSITIVITY AT ALL.
>> CAN'T YOU SEE YOURSELF
WITH A WHITENING LIGHT SMILE?
YOU'LL FINALLY KNOW HOW GREAT IT
FEELS WHEN YOUR TEETH ARE
THE WHITEST THEY CAN BE.
YOUR SMILE IS THE FIRST THING
PEOPLE SEE, AND IT SAYS A LOT
ABOUT YOU, AND WHEN YOUR SMILE
IS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL, YOU
FEEL MORE CONFIDENT AND HAPPY.
A DAZZLING SMILE CAN REALLY
CHANGE YOUR WHOLE ATTITUDE, AND
IT CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
THINK ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ALMOST
INSTANTLY WHITEN YOUR TEETH
UP TO SIX SHADES AND MORE
ANY TIME YOU WANT.
WELL, YOU CAN WITH KLEAR ACTION
WHITENING LIGHT.
>> I'VE GIVEN UP ON OTHER
PRODUCTS, BUT THIS WHITENING
LIGHT IS SO QUICK AND EASY
TO FOLLOW, AND YOU'RE DONE
IN JUST UNDER ONE HOUR.
THAT IS NOT A LOT OF TIME.
>> THE RESULTS WERE PHENOMENAL.
I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE CHANGE
RIGHT AWAY, AND IN UNDER AN
HOUR, MY TEETH WENT EIGHT SHADES
WHITER WITH THE WHITENING LIGHT.
>> WELL, I AM AN OCCASIONAL
SMOKER, AND USING THE WHITENING
LIGHT MADE MY TEETH WHITE AGAIN.
IT REMOVED ALL THE TOUGHEST
STAINS, AND NOW I'VE GOT A WHITE
SET OF TEETH AGAIN
WITH CONFIDENCE.
>> KLEAR ACTION 
>> IN CASE YOU'RE JUST JOINING
US, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A REVOLUTION IN TOOTH WHITENING.
FROM THE CITY THAT SETS THE
STANDARD FOR BEAUTY AND STYLE--
SOUTH BEACH-- COMES THE KLEAR
ACTION WHITENING LIGHT TOOTH
WHITENING SYSTEM BY ACTIVA.
THE WHITENING LIGHT IS THE FIRST
AND ONLY IN-HOME LIGHT THERAPY
FOR WHITENING YOUR TEETH, AND IT
WORKS LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE
EVER SEEN.
YOU CAN GO UP TO SIX SHADES
LIGHTER OR MORE IN UNDER
AN HOUR.
THAT'S RIGHT, IN UNDER AN HOUR.
>> IT'S VERY SIMPLE, SIMPLE,
THREE EASY STEPS.
YOU RINSE, BRUSH AND AIM, AND
YOU'RE DONE.
AND YOU CAN DO IT IN THE PRIVACY
OF YOUR OWN HOME.
MY TEETH WENT EIGHT SHADES
WHITER, THANKS TO THE WHITENING
LIGHT SYSTEM.
IT WAS AMAZING.
>> Man: TO USE WHITENING STRIPS,
YOU HAVE TO USE THEM FOR UP TO
14 HOURS, AND THE TRAYS,
YOU SLEEP WITH THEM AT NIGHT...
AND WITH WHITENING LIGHT,
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO
FIND ONE HOUR IN YOUR DAY
TO GET NINE SHADES WHITER.
>> I'D ACTUALLY PREVIOUSLY HAD
A DENTIST TELL ME THAT IF I'D
WHITEN MY TEETH, IT WOULD ONLY
CHANGE A FEW SHADES,
SO WHY BOTHER?
TODAY, I ACTUALLY CHANGED UP 10
SHADES, AND NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'VE GOT THESE, LIKE, REALLY
SPARKLING WHITE TEETH.
>> Announcer: SO MANY PEOPLE ARE
THRILLED WITH THE RESULTS
THEY'RE GETTING
FROM WHITENING LIGHT.
BUT WHAT DO DENTAL
PROFESSIONALS THINK?
WE GATHERED A GROUP OF HIGHLY
RESPECTED DENTISTS TO GET THEIR
THOUGHTS ON KLEAR ACTION
WHITENING LIGHT SYSTEM.
>> YOU USED THE KLEAR ACTION
WHITENING LIGHT.
>> I'VE SORT OF FOLLOWED
THE EVOLUTION OF WHITENING
SYSTEMS OVER THE YEARS, AND AS
NEW PRODUCTS COME OUT, I WANT TO
TRY THEM ON MYSELF BEFORE I MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION TO THE PATIENT.
SO WHEN THE NEW WHITENING LIGHT
SYSTEM CAME OUT, I WAS ANXIOUS
TO TRY IT, AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY
NO SENSITIVITY, AND IT TOOK MY
TEETH TO A WHITER SHADE
THAN I'VE EVER HAD THEM BEFORE.
>> WELL, IT'S THE THREE STEPS
WORKING SYNERGISTICALLY
WITH EACH OTHER THAT PROVIDE
THE RESULTS THAT YOU GET, SO
WE'RE NOT HAVING TO USE AS
POTENT OF A SUBSTANCE, UM, BUT
WE'RE GETTING THE RESULTS AS IF
YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING
POSSIBLY IN THE OFFICE.
>> AND PEOPLE WANT TO USE
A SYSTEM THAT'S EASY, AND THIS
IS A VERY EASY SYSTEM TO USE.
>> THE TECHNIQUE IS MUCH LESS
EXPENSIVE AND MUCH MORE
AFFORDABLE FOR A MAJORITY OF
THE POPULATION.
>> MY TEETH-- AS WHITE AS THEY
ARE, UM, BECAUSE I'VE USED A LOT
OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS
OVER THE YEARS-- GOT ABOUT FOUR
TO FIVE SHADES LIGHTER.
>> I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING THAT CAN LIGHTEN THIS
MUCH THIS FAST.
WITH THE KLEAR ACTION WHITENING
SYSTEM, WE'VE HAD NO REPORTS OF
SENSITIVITY AT ALL.
>> IS THAT PRETTY MUCH
EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE?
>> YES, VERY MUCH.
>> I'VE CONSIDERED HAVING
THE LIGHT THERAPY DONE AT MY
DENTIST'S OFFICE BECAUSE I WATCH
THESE MAKEOVER SHOWS AND THEY
ALWAYS HAVE THESE BEAUTIFUL
WHITE TEETH, AND I WANT
THAT, TOO.
AND THEN I HEARD ABOUT THE KLEAR
ACTION WHITENING LIGHT, AND
I THOUGHT, "THIS IS PERFECT."
I MEAN, HERE, YOU GET THE SAME
THING THAT YOU GET
IN A DENTIST'S OFFICE,
FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE.
>> FOR ME, IF I HAVE A BAD HAIR
DAY, I'LL PUT ON A HAT, OR IF
I'M HAVING BAD SKIN, I'LL PUT ON
SOME MAKEUP.
BUT IF YOU HAVE BAD TEETH,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WALK AROUND WITH YOUR HAND
IN FRONT OF YOUR MOUTH?
YOU CAN'T, SO THIS IS...
THIS IS THE SOLUTION.
>> IT REALLY IS DIFFICULT TO PUT
A VALUE ON A BRIGHT,
BEAUTIFUL SMILE.
HOW MANY OF US WOULDN'T WANT
WHITER TEETH?
EVEN IF YOU THINK YOUR TEETH ARE
ALREADY WHITE, CHANCES ARE YOU
CAN GET THEM EVEN WHITER.
AND MANY OF YOU HAVE SUFFERED
WITH DULL, STAINED TEETH
FOR YEARS, BUT YOU JUST COULDN'T
TAKE THE SENSITIVITY CAUSED BY
THE DENTAL PROCEDURES AND
TREATMENTS, OR YOU JUST COULDN'T
AFFORD THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS
IT COST.
I KNOW EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING
FOR AN ALTERNATIVE THAT'S EASY,
AFFORDABLE, CAUSES NO PAIN
AND WORKS FAST.
WELL, YOUR WAIT IS OVER BECAUSE
NOW YOU CAN HAVE A WHITENING
LIGHT SMILE ANYTIME, ANYWHERE,
UP TO SIX SHADES LIGHTER
IN UNDER AN HOUR, GUARANTEED.
THIS REVOLUTIONARY LIGHT
WHITENING TECHNOLOGY IS NOT
AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE, SO YOU
NEED TO CALL AND ORDER YOUR
WHITENING LIGHT RIGHT NOW.
IF YOU WANT 'EM WHITE, YOU NEED
THE LIGHT.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE,
AND KEEP SMILING.

>> Female announcer: THIS HAS
BEEN A PAID PRESENTATION FOR
KLEAR ACTION WHITENING LIGHT
TOOTH WHITENING SYSTEM, BROUGHT
TO YOU BY THANE INTERNATIONAL.

>> Okay.
I get 20 people to agree to go
to my web site and try
the vitamin.
When do I get paid?
>> Every Friday the company
sends out checks to everyone who
earned it the week prior.
>> This probably the easiest
money I've ever made.
I've made over $2,000 an hour.
That's more than a lot of
doctors make or lawyers.
>> I've made $49,000 since
November just by telling people
to go to my web site.
>> So far I've made over
$30,000.
And with it, I've been able to
pay college.
I've been able to put away money
for savings.
I've been able to go to
the store, go shopping.
I've been able to help out
my family.
It's completely changed my life.
>> When Don Lapre first
approached our formulation team,
we thought he was joking when
he said spare no expense and
assemble whatever research was
necessary to create The Greatest
Vitamin in the World.
We had never had so much
unlimited freedom to create
a formula this complete.
We took over 100 years of
research experience from our
formulation team.
And we put it into one formula.
The best way that I can explain
this is if you had the world's
leading research team at your
disposal and someone came to you
and asked you to create the
ultimate product for the body,
you would end up with
The Greatest Vitamin in
the World.
>> And all I do is get 20 new
people to agree to try these
vitamins and I get paid $1,000?
>> Yes.
And the best part is you don't
have to any selling.
You just send people to your
web site.
And the web site educates
the people.
It takes the order and it does
everything for you.
>> At first my wife thought it
was just another little thing
I had got into.
But until she started pulling
the checks out of the mailbox.
I mean the checks kept coming
and coming and coming.
>> In one month I earned $6,000.
And all I did was tell people to
go to my web site.
That's it.
>> I mean in the first few
weeks I've made over $7,500.
And that's just beyond what my
wildest dreams ever where when
I started.
>> This had to be the easiest
$6,000 I've ever made in my
life.
>> Okay.
So if I get set up as
an independent advertiser,
the company supplies me with
my own web site and everything
I need, right?
>> Exactly.
And if you were to get 100 new
people to try the vitamin in any
given month, not only do you get
paid $5,000, 1,000 on every 20
new people, you also get paid
a $5,000 bonus check.
>> Okay, wait a minute.
If I get 100 new people in the
month of July, you have to pay
me $10,000?
>> Yes.
And we made the program 50 times
more exciting.
After we gave away over
$1 million to our independent
advertisers, we realized we
haven't even reached one percent
of the population.
So we got together and discussed
a way we could get each person
50 times more excited.
>> Okay, how can you make this
program 50 times more exciting?
>> Well, we created an
additional program that we are
just going to include with the
Independent Advertiser Program.
And it will allow you to create
hundreds of other independent
advertisers who are all tagged
to you.
You don't have to speak to them.
You don't have to do anything.
But each time they get 20 new
people to just try The Greatest
Vitamin in the World, they're
excited because they get $1,000.
But you are gonna get really
excited because you get paid
$500 just because that person
is tagged to you.
>> Okay.
So you're saying on top of me
making $1,000 checks
I could be getting paid $500
checks from hundreds of other
independent advertisers who are
out there doing the same thing?
>> Exactly.
And you never speak to those
people.
And you can grow an army of
people who are all tagged to
you.
And on top of you getting paid
$1,000 checks each time you get
20 new people to try the
vitamin, when those people do
the same thing, they make $1,000
and you get paid $500.
>> Okay.
So how many other people have
made money doing this?
>> Well, that's just it.
Before we made this program 50
times better we had people from
all over the country who made
themselves a quiet fortune just
with the basic Independent
Advertiser Program.
>> I feel like I'm gonna blow up
sometimes when I go to that
mailbox.
And those checks.
I love to see those green checks
with The Greatest Vitamin in the
World on the envelope.
As a matter of fact, my mailman
has began to tease me.
I know sometimes when I have
checks he'll walk by and say,
"I have nothing for you."
So, "Okay.
Bring it to me, bring it to me.
I know you have a check for me."
>> A business like this can be
not only done anywhere in the
country, but it can be done
anywhere in the world.
And that's the beauty of
the Internet.
It's just like this income
opportunity.
There is no limits.
And we haven't even seen
the best days yet.
>> As a matter of fact I took
the first check and framed it,
which was a $1,000 check.
And that was for the 20
individuals that tried
the product.
And it's so simple.
So if you're thinking about
an opportunity, this it is.
>> In just minutes, you could be
completely set up with your very
own vitamin web site that's
designed to do all of the work
for you.
Listen to this.
You just send people to your
web site.
The web site will actually
educate people on the incredible
benefits of The Greatest Vitamin
in the World.
And then every single time you
get another 20 new people to go
to your web site and to just try
the product, you just made
yourself a check for $1,000.
>> The Greatest Vitamin in the
World is also the greatest
business in the world.
Not only do you get to represent
and take literally The Greatest
Vitamin in the World, you get to
make, well, in my case, more
than $500 an hour sharing
the great product with others.
>> Every single time you get
just 20 new people to go to your
web site and to agree to just
try The Greatest Vitamin in the
World risk free I'm gonna send
you a check for $1,000.
>> I have never made this amount
of money in this short of time
in my entire life.
>> Seeing all the testimonials
on TV, it just got me excited.
I was like, "Wow.
Those people are just making so
much money."
So I just decided to join
myself.
And I'm really glad I did,
because after I joined I've been
making so much money.
I've made over $30,000 so far.
And checks are coming in every
week.
>> Can you imagine if you create
300 to 400 independent
advertisers who are all tagged
to you?
And then the company launches
three or four more amazing
things that we all can make
money with?
Your income potential could
skyrocket.
>> Okay.
I want 500 people tagged to me
right now.
How do I do that?
>> Well, just one way is to hand
out our brochure that explains
the entire company.
You're allowed to print out as
many as you like.
It has your reference number
attached.
So every time a person gets
signed up as an independent
advertiser from one of your
brochures, that person is tagged
to you for life.
>> So I hand out this brochure
and that person gets started.
Every single time they go out
and get 20 new people to try
The Greatest Vitamin in the
World, they're gonna get paid
$1,000 and I automatically get
paid $500?
Just because I created that
person, right?
>> Exactly.
And, Veronica, you could create
hundreds of independent
advertisers all over the country
who are making you these $500
checks every time they make
themself a $1,000 check.
And think of how many people
you will start telling about
the vitamin.
They ask you how it works.
You tell them how you get paid.
They want to do the same thing.
And then that person is tagged
to you for life.
And each time that person makes
him or herself $1,000,
you get 500 bucks.
>> So for every independent
advertiser who is tagged to me,
no matter how many $1,000 checks
they create for themselves,
I still get paid $500 each time?
>> Yes.
Let's say you get a friend named
John to do this because he sees
you making all this money.
Then you get so busy that you
stop doing this, but John keeps
making $1,000 checks.
Veronica, for as along as John
keeps making $1,000 checks,
we keep sending you $500 checks.
>> So if I was the one who
created one of those people,
I would've gotten paid $500 each
time they got paid $1,000?
>> Exactly.
And, Veronica, this is a product
that you can be so proud of.
>> Our goal is to educate over
200 million people living in
the United States today about
the amazing difference between
synthetic, stripped-down
vitamins that are being sold
today versus The Greatest
Vitamin in the World.
And the money that we pay you
just for letting people know
that this vitamin exists is just
insane.
>> Don Lapre has done it again.
>> Starting out of a one-bedroom
apartment--
>> Don took tiny classifieds and
generated millions of dollars.
>> Now Don has outdone himself
by creating the most incredible
way in the world--
>> That you could make a fortune
week after week with a product
that everyone needs.
>> The Greatest Vitamin in the
World.
>> And listen to this.
There is over $1.5 billion
a week spent on vitamins and
minerals.
>> So Don took his moneymaking
skills--
>> Combined it with The Greatest
Vitamin in the World--
>> And the result is a super
simple way for you to tap into
this exploding market.
>> And put money in your pocket
week after week.
>> With Don Lapre's new
Independent Advertiser Program.
>> You'll get started the very
first day with Don as your
personal inspiration and coach.
>> Then with Don's one-on-one
video presentation, you'll learn
the secrets that make this
program so amazing.
>> Plus you'll get your very own
web site.
>> That was specifically
designed by Don and his
marketing team to do all the
selling so you don't have to.
>> All you do is send people to
your web site and you're done.
>> And every time just 20 people
try this amazing vitamin
risk-free, you'll get a check
from Don's office for $1,000.
>> Or up to $200 per month with
Don's lifetime revenue plan.
>> It's just that simple.
>> I can make $100 an hour and
don't have to be on a nine to
five job.
>> In just two days, I earned
$6,000.
>> It's so easy it blows me
away.
Especially my wife.
>> The vitamin itself is
absolutely amazing.
But to make more than $500
an hour since I started,
I mean that's unbelievable.
>> This is probably the easiest
money I've ever made.
I've made over $2,000 an hour.
That's more than a lot of
doctors make or lawyers.
>> You can be set up today with
Don's entire Independent
Advertiser Program.
>> And learn the secrets on how
you can cash in on this
billion-dollar market.
>> Right from the comfort of

beginning.

easiest $5,000 I have ever made
in my entire life.
I would tell anybody watching
this show they have to do it.
>> This is the easiest $5,000
I've ever made in my entire
life.

$5,000 bonus checks every month.

could receive an additional
$5,000 bonus check every month.
This is truly a limited time
offer.
So call the number on the screen
right now.
>> The vitamin is so amazing we
decided to call it The Greatest
Vitamin in the World.
Instead of being a company that
spends millions of dollars
getting their product or their
service into stores and into
retail, I decided to put
millions of dollars into
the hands of my independent
advertisers.
And just like the people that
you saw on this show today,
that could easily be you.
And if it doesn't make sense
yet, just stick around.
And I promise you in the next
few minutes you're gonna wish
that you could've got started
doing this ten years ago.
>> How much is a bottle of these
vitamins?
>> Well, actually it should cost
over $200 because we use some of
the most expensive ingredients
known to man.
But listen to this.
It's under $40 plus shipping
and handling.
>> And listen to this.
Every single time you get just
20 new people to go to your web
site and to agree to just try
The Greatest Vitamin in the
World risk-free, I'm gonna send
you a check for $1,000.
>> I just called up and signed
up for the program.
I got a web site.
And then all I have to do is
send people to that web site.
Once I've sent 20 people to that
web site and they've made
a purchase, I get a check
for $1,000.
>> I've spent less than 20 hours
doing this.
And I've already made $6,000.
I can't even believe it.
>> People visit the web site.
They get blown away by the
health information, by Don
Lapre's video on the web site,
and then they purchase
the vitamin.
>> I've spent more time getting
the checks and taking them to
the bank than I have just about
setting it up and actually
promoting it.
>> I think what makes this
business really easy--
Opportunity, business, whatever
you want to call it.
I just call it having fun and
telling people I know that they
should be healthy.
In just two days, I earned
$6,000.
>> When 20 people go to my web
site and try the vitamin and I
receive $1,000, that just blows
me away.
>> I've been recommending this
product for less than two
months.
In the past, you know, six to
seven weeks my income is in the
neighborhood of about $7,500.
And that is really, really
feeling pretty good.
>> The vitamin industry is
a multibillion-dollar business.
And yet so much of that is with
synthetic, stripped-down
vitamins.
So when I created a vitamin that
was unlike anything out there,
one with the highest grade
nutrients in the world without
compromising one thing,
and then I combined that with
the moneymaking secrets that I
learned over the last 15 years,
you end up with the most
incredible making-money
opportunity on Earth.
>> Okay.
I get 20 people to agree to go
to my web site and try
the vitamin.
When do I get paid?
>> Every Friday the company
sends out checks to everyone
who earned it the week prior.
And think of how many people
you will start telling about
the vitamin.
They ask you how it works.
You tell them how you get paid.
They want to do the same thing.
And then that person is tagged
to you for life.
And each time that person makes
him or herself $1,000, you get
500 bucks.
>> You know, like I said before,
I've been in a lot of businesses
where they didn't--
They had slow pay or no pay.
And Don Lapre pays every week on
time.
I've never been at a business--
My wife has seen the light.
As a matter of fact, when I
landed in Phoenix she called me
on my cell phone and said,
"You got checks in the mail."
And this program works.
>> What everything Don Lapre has
said was going to happen has
happened for us.
And that's the track record
I'm going on.
The checks come in the mail.
And believe you me, they come.
And many times there's more than
just one.
>> Before I knew it, I had
generated 20 customers, and that
first check for $1,000 came
to me.
You know, I've been watching Don
for 15 years.
And there's no doubt that he's
successful.
I had never ordered any of his
products until I ordered The
Greatest Vitamin in the World.
And now I'm sort of regretful
that, you know, I probably
could've made money with Don
10 years ago, 15 years ago.
>> What do the people you just
saw--
>> And the people you're about
to see do to make that kind
of money?
>> Well, it's the result of what
happens when you take
The Greatest Vitamin in the
World made from the best
all-natural ingredients known
to man.
>> A vitamin so amazing that
once people try and see how good
it makes them feel, and the
benefits it has for a longer,
healthier life, will want
to take it forever.
>> And you combine it with
Don Lapre, one of the country's
leading minds for building
wealth.
>> Someone who's been on TV for
over 15 years helping other
people make money.
>> And has personally generated
hundreds of millions dollars in
his life.
>> And put together, you get
something unlike anything you've
ever seen before in your life.
>> You get the greatest way in
the world that can make you
an absolute fortune while
helping other people stay
healthy.
>> If I had to record like the
amount of time that I spend--
I mean, sometimes it's an hour
a day, sometimes it's two hours
a day, sometimes it's like two
or three hours a week.
And, you know, it really feels
phenomenal to be able to have
such great response to people
wanting to try the product and
then be compensated so royally
for it.
I mean in the first few weeks
I've made over $7,500.
And that's just beyond what
my wildest dreams ever were when
I started.
It is absolutely the easiest
money I've ever made in my
entire life.
>> It's so straightforward and
simple.
Anyone can do this business.
>> It's so easy it blows me
away.
Especially my wife.
>> I've spent more time getting
the checks and taking them to
the bank than I have just about
setting it up and actually

and told me that I had won
$5,000 I couldn't even

It was the easiest thing I have

new people, you also get paid

all of the work for you.
Listen to this.
You just send people to your
web site.
The web site will actually
educate people on the incredible
benefits of The Greatest Vitamin
in the World.
And then every single time you
get another 20 new people to go
to your web site and to just try
the product, you just made
yourself a check for $1,000.
>> I was laid up.
And the money was stopping.
It had stopped coming in.
And I needed money desperately
to help my son.
And this was a godsend.
I made $15,000 that all went
directly to my son.
And without it, he would've had
to drop out of college.
>> How would making thousands
and thousands of dollars more
affect you and your family's way
of life?
What if it allowed you to take
an incredible cruise or
an exotic vacation every six
months because you were bringing
in all this extra income?
Or what if it allowed you to buy
a bigger home?
Or it just allowed you to wipe
out all your bills?
Well, why not?
The people that you saw on this
show and so many others will
generate so much money.
Why not you?
>> Okay.
I want to get started.
What should I do?
>> Well, Veronica, if all you
want to do is make $1,000
checks, that's easy.
But it goes back to the same
question.
Do you want to make from your
efforts or from your effort plus
the efforts of hundreds of other
people?
>> If your best friend was
sitting at home watching you
right now, what would you tell
him or her?
>> Oh, I would say, if you're
looking for an exciting way to
generate $500, $1,000 checks,
or $5,000 bonus checks working
part-time, pick up the phone and
get set up as an independent
advertiser right now.
And see for yourself just how
amazing this really is.
>> The checks come in the mail.
And believe you me, they come.
And many times there are more
than just one.
>> I'm $49,000 richer.
I am living the life I'm
supposed to live.
And I will continue to do this
for the rest of my life if I'm
so lucky.
>> Pick up the phone and get
started right now.
>> So far I've made over
$30,000.
My best month I made over
$10,000.
And it was a really good feeling
to make that much in just one
month.
And I did it just basically just
sending people to my web site.
I didn't do anything else.
>> The idea of helping people
is great.
And making money at it at
the same time is even better.
I made $10,000 in 10 hours.
>> I've helped change the lives
of all the people that you saw
today along with so many other
people that I could never put
them all on this show.
And I'd love to do the same for
you.
Pick up the phone.
And make that call right now.

[...]
>> HI, I'M WENDY WALSH, AND I AM
SO THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH
SHANE MALEK, THE DIRECTOR OF THE
NEVADA HAIR & SCALP INSTITUTE,
AND THE DEVELOPER OF SCALP MED.
WELCOME, SHANE.
>> THANK YOU, WENDY.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
>> NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
DISCOVERED AND DEVELOPED
SCALP MED AT YOUR OWN CLINIC.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WENDY.
WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING THIS
PRODUCT FOR YEARS.
A LOT OF LATE NIGHTS AND NOW
WE FINALLY HAVE IT PERFECT.
THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE SEEING
IN OUR CLINIC ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
>> Wendy: THAT'S AN
UNDERSTATEMENT, SHANE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS.
THIS IS J.C. ON DAY ONE.
NOW, YOU CAN SEE HOW HIS HAIR IS
NEARLY GONE ON TOP.
HERE HE IS AFTER JUST EIGHT
WEEKS USING SCALP MED.
THE HAIR'S GROWING IN THICK, AND
THE BALD SPOT IS NEARLY GONE.
NOW LOOK FOUR WEEKS LATER.
AFTER JUST 12 WEEKS,
HIS HAIR IS BACK!
AND JUST LOOK AT HOW THICK AND
HEALTHY IT IS...
INCREDIBLE!
JOSEPHINE'S HAIR WAS ALMOST
COMPLETELY GONE.
BUT AFTER JUST SIX WEEKS WITH
SCALP MED, YOU CAN ALREADY SEE
MOST OF HER HAIR BACK.
THIS IS 14 WEEKS.
NOW TAKE A LOOK AT JOSEPHINE
AFTER JUST 24 WEEKS.
THAT IS A FULL, THICK, HEALTHY
HEAD OF HAIR.
SHE WAS EVEN ABLE
TO COLOR IT AGAIN.
NO WIGS OR WEAVES EVER AGAIN
FOR JOSEPHINE.
HER HAIR IS BACK!
AND LOOK AT DANIEL.
DANIEL WAS WELL ON HIS WAY TO
LOSING HIS HAIR.
HE WAS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
SPENDING $20,000 OR MORE ON HAIR
TRANSPLANTS... UNTIL SCALP MED.
THIS IS DANIEL JUST
SIX WEEKS LATER.
YOU CAN ALREADY SEE THE HAIR
FILLING IN.
AND IN JUST 14 WEEKS, DANIEL'S
HAIR IS BACK.
IF YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM MALE OR
FEMALE PATTERN BALDNESS,
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW INCREDIBLE
SCALP MED WORKS.
AND FROM ANOTHER ANGLE, YOU CAN
REALLY SEE HOW QUICKLY SCALP MED
CAN FILL IN THAT BALD SPOT.
THE HAIR IS BACK IN JUST
SIX WEEKS...
AMAZING!
NOW, THIS IS JOHN ON DAY ONE.
AFTER EIGHT WEEKS, YOU CAN SEE
THE HAIR GROWING RIGHT OUT OF
HIS BALD SPOT.
AND IN 19 WEEKS,
JOHN'S HAIR IS BACK.
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRESSION OF
RESULTS IN HAPPY CUSTOMER AFTER
HAPPY CUSTOMER.
LIKE MANY OF US, MARIE HAD
IGNORED HER THINNING HAIR FOR
YEARS, UNTIL IT GOT TO THIS
STAGE AND WAS GETTING WORSE.
LUCKILY, SHE FOUND SCALP MED
IN TIME...
BECAUSE HERE SHE IS, LOOKING
BEAUTIFUL NOW!
LOOK AT THIS!
MARIE'S HAIR IS BACK.
NOW, THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
SO, WHETHER YOU'RE THINNING OR
BALDING, IN JUST A FEW SHORT
MONTHS OF USING SCALP MED, YOUR
HAIR WILL COME BACK--
YOUR OWN HAIR, FULL, THICK,
HEALTHY AND STRONG.
YOU'LL LOOK AND FEEL
YOUNG AGAIN.
>> WE'VE STOPPED THE HAIR LOSS,
WE'VE REVERSED THE CYCLE, AND
WE'VE GROWN NEW HAIR.
>> SO WHAT MAKES SCALP MED
SO DIFFERENT?
>> WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED IS A
WAY TO GET THIS LOTION, INSTEAD
OF PENETRATING THROUGH THE SKIN,
IT SITS ON TOP OF THE FOLLICLE
AND IT FILLS THE CRATERS, LIKE
I SAID, AND THE LIQUID NATURALLY
GETS SUCKED IN BY THE FOLLICLE,
SURROUNDING THE BULB, AND IT
INCREASES BLOOD FLOW TO
THE HAIR.
>> Wendy: SO YOU FOUND A WAY TO
KEEP THE MEDICATION RIGHT IN
THE HAIR FOLLICLE, WHERE IT
NEEDS TO WORK TO GROW HAIR.
JUST LOOK AT THIS MICRO-CLOSE-UP
OF TYPICAL MALE OR FEMALE
PATTERN BALDNESS.
WHAT LITTLE HAIR IS LEFT IS THIN
AND DYING.
NOW LOOK AT THAT SAME EXACT SPOT
AFTER SCALP MED.
SEE HOW MANY NEW HAIRS HAVE
GROWN IN?
AND NOW THEY'RE FULL AND THICK
AND HEALTHY.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES SCALP MED
SO AMAZING.
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE
FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN.
>> EXACTLY, WENDY.
>> WHY I KNOW SCALP MED WORKS
IS, I SEE IT WORK, I SEE THE
HAIR GROW AND I SEE THE PATIENTS
COMING BACK AND I SEE
THE PATIENTS BUYING MORE
AND USING IT.
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY COME BACK AND
SAY, "YOU KNOW, DR. GARCIA, YOU
KNOW, WE GOTTA FIND SOMETHING
ELSE, 'CAUSE I CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE," NO.
THEY COME BACK AND SAY, "HEY,
DR. GARCIA, I NEED MORE 'CAUSE
IT'S WORKING."
>> IF IT CONTINUED AT THE RATE
IT WAS GOING, I WAS HEADING
DIRECTLY INTO CUE BALL CITY.
EVENTUALLY, I JUST... IT WOULD
JUST BE A PART OF ME, THE
BALDNESS, YOU KNOW, THAT DARK,
HATEFUL AREA OF ME THAT I JUST
PRETENDED LIKE IT WAS
NEVER THERE.
BUT, IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA SAY,
"HEY, GRAB THIS, SMACK IT ON
THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD." [LAUGHS]
"YOU KNOW, IT'LL GROW."
THAT'S HOW EASY IT WAS.
IT'S... LIVING PROOF RIGHT HERE.
IT'S, I MEAN, IT'S MY HAIR.
IT'S MY HAIR.
IT WORKS.
>> THIS IS A WOMAN.
>> Wendy: OH... DEAR.
>> IMAGINE GOING THROUGH LIFE
LOOKING LIKE THAT AND THEN GOING
TO YOUR DOCTOR, AND THEY'RE
TELLING YOU THERE'S NOTHING THEY
CAN DO FOR YOU.
YOU'RE HELPLESS. >> MM...
>> RIGHT? >> YEAH.
>> JUNE 22, 2004.
LOOK AT THE BABY HAIRS THAT ARE
GROWING DOWN THERE, AND YOU LOOK
AT HOW MUCH THICKER THE HAIR
SHAFTS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING.
>> WOW... AMAZING.
>> NO, WAIT TILL YOU SEE--
WAIT, IT GETS BETTER.
THIS IS OCTOBER 19th.
>> WHOA!
SO ANOTHER SIX WEEKS LATER AND
SHE'S GOT.

>> EVEN THOUGH I'M THE
PRESIDENT, NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
COSMETOLOGY, I'M HERE AS A
CUSTOMER, BECAUSE I AM
SO IMPRESSED.
IT WAS TOTALLY EMPTY IN HERE.
I HAD NOTHING, NOTHING...
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF FUZZ.
SO YOU'D SEE... AND THE HAIR
WOULD STOP.
NOW IT, IT JUST KIND OF BLENDS
ALL THE WAY BACK.
SO I'M VERY EXCITED.
I MEAN, HEY, TO HAVE HAIR
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH A
SURGICAL PROCEDURE IS TERRIFIC.
I HAVE BEEN IN THE HAIR BUSINESS
FOR, UM, 16 YEARS, AND I'VE
NOT... I'VE HAD CLIENTS
USING EVERYTHING.
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING AND, UM,
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY GET
RESULTS LIKE THIS.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
NOT IN A TOPICAL.
THE ONLY TIME I'VE SEEN ANYBODY
GET ANYTHING LIKE THIS WAS
FROM-- ANYTHING CLOSE-- WAS FROM
A TRANSPLANT, SURGICALLY.
>> HAIR TRANSPLANT'S SCARY.
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE HOLES IN YOUR HEAD OR...
THEY'RE REALLY GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME HAIR.
AND WITH SCALP MED, YOU SPRAY IT
ON AT NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO
BED... AFTER SHOWERING AND...
THAT'S IT.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE... I LOOKED
AT MYSELF BEFORE AND I THINK
RIGHT NOW I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY
JUST HAD THIN STRANDS ON TOP OF
MY HEAD.
IF... IF YOU LOOK AT THE
PICTURES OF THE BEFORE AND AFTER
PICTURES, IT WAS ASTRONOMICAL,
THE DIFFERENCE.
IT WAS ALL SKIN RIGHT HERE, YOU
COULDN'T EVEN SEE IT, BUT,
THERE'S, LIKE THICK HAIR
THERE NOW.
>> AND, SHERITA, WELCOME
TO OUR SHOW.
>> THANK YOU.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THIS WAS YOU?
>> YEAH...
>> TAKE ME BACK TO THIS TIME.
>> DURING THAT TIME, THAT WAS A,
UM... A VERY INSECURE, UM...
HURTING WOMAN THAT...
WAS ASHAMED OF WHO SHE WAS,
UM...
COULDN'T DATE, COULDN'T...
I COULDN'T GO SWIMMING, I...
I STOPPED MY CAREER, I, UM,
I WAS IN HIDING.
I MEAN, BUT YOU... YOU SEE WHY.
I SUFFERED WITH THIS, GOD, FOR
SO MANY YEARS THAT IT HAD
BASICALLY BECOME A PART OF WHO I
WAS, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY TO KNOW WHO I WAS.
>> Wendy: BUT YOU KNEW.
>> BUT I KNEW.
>> SO YOU USED WIGS OR
HAIR EXTENSIONS?
>> MOST OF THE TIME IT WAS HAIR
EXTENSIONS, BUT THEN BECAUSE
IT'S SO TIME-CONSUMING-- AND
WHEN I SAY HAIR EXTENSIONS, NOT
BRAIDS, I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BRAID-- SO, IT WAS THE
GLUE-ON, UM, HAIR EXTENSIONS.
AND I TRIED VITAMINS, I HAD
TRIED, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING ON
THE MARKET.
YOU GO IN THE BEAUTY SALON, AND
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, "TRY THIS,
THIS'LL GROW HAIR AND... SUPER
GROW AND THIS GROWTH AND THAT
GROWTH AND..."
>> NOTHING WORKED.
>> NOTHING WORKED.
I DID, UM, LASER THERAPY,
WHERE THEY STIMULATE THE SCALP,
OR WHATEVER, WITH LASER.
NOTHING WORKED.
AND IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
I HAD, UM, I HAD PUT IN
A PRAYER REQUEST...
[CHOKING UP]
FORGIVE ME...
AT CHURCH, UM...
I DIDN'T PUT MY NAME ON IT.
I JUST SAID THAT I WANTED GOD TO
RESTORE MY HAIR. [SOBS]
AND I SAID THAT HE GAVE SHANE
THE KNOWLEDGE TO INVENT THIS
MIRACLE PRODUCT AND NOW HERE I
AM, SO...
[LAUGHING AND CRYING]
>> LOOK AT YOU... OH...
>> THAT WAS ME.
THAT WAS..
I WAS MISS BLACK NEVADA.
>> OH, YOU WERE.
>> [CRYING]
THAT WAS MISS BLACK NEVADA.
>> AND NOW LOOK AT YOU.
>> AND NOW IT'S, IT'S REAL.
>> A REAL BEAUTY QUEEN.
>> A REAL BEAUTY QUEEN.
NOT SOMEONE WALKING
AROUND, PRETENDING.
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY,
WHEN THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD DO
IT, I WAS LIKE, "YES," BECAUSE
THERE'S SO MANY-- I MEAN, I'M
HEARING MORE THAT I'M, YOU
KNOW-- I CAN TALK ABOUT IT NOW
AND I CAN BRING IT UP AND IT'S,
IT'S MY TESTIMONY, YOU KNOW--
IT'S MY PERSONAL TESTIMONY.
I CAN STAND UP AND TELL ANYBODY
THAT THERE IS, THERE IS HELP AND
THERE'S HOPE OUT THERE, AND I
DIDN'T REALIZE... AND WHEN I
STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT,
JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE SUFFER
WITH THAT CONDITION.
SO IT'S JUST, IT'S A, IT'S A
RELIEF, IT'S A, UM...
OH, MY GOD... [LAUGHS]
[SINGSONG]: I GOT HAIR. 
[LAUGHING]
I GOT HAIR!
>> Wendy: YES, YOU DO.
>> I GOT HAIR.
OH, MY GOD, I AM CRYING.
>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF HAIR.
AND SO IN EIGHT MONTHS, YOU GREW
A BRAND-NEW, COMPLETE, THICK
HEAD OF HEALTHY HAIR.
>> LOOK AT THIS.
>> YEAH, IT'S LONG.
>> IT'S LONG.
>> IT'S LONG, IT'S SO CURLY.
>> [LAUGHING]
>> IT'S SO CURLY THAT IT'S
SHRUNK UP, BUT IT'S LONG HAIR.
>> IT IS LONG!
SO, WE'VE MEASURED IT,
AND HOW LONG?
>> IT'S CLOSE TO FIVE INCHES.
>> YEAH, GROWTH IN THE...
>> Wendy: FIVE INCHES
IN EIGHT MONTHS. >> YES.
>> FROM NOTHING.
>> FROM NOTHING.
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LIFE.
MY JOY IS BACK, MY PEACE IS
BACK, MY, UM, CONFIDENCE
IS BACK.
>> Wendy: I WAS GONNA SAY,
YOU'RE EXUDING SELF-ESTEEM HERE.
>> YES... [LAUGHING]
>> YOU'RE JUST SITTING HERE...
I'M LIKE, I WANT IT TO COME ON
TOP OF ME, I'M LOVING THIS
SELF-ESTEEM-- IT'S GREAT.
>> I LOVE IT.
>> YOU LOVE YOURSELF.
>> I LOVE MYSELF.
>> AS A DERMATOLOGIST, WE'RE THE
FRONT-LINE PHYSICIANS THAT GET
TO EVALUATE THESE DRUGS THAT ARE
USED FOR HAIR LOSS.
AND I'VE USED EVERYTHING OUT
THERE THAT, UM, HAS BEEN MADE
FOR HAIR LOSS.
UM, EVERY PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND
I EVEN RESORT TO
OVER-THE-COUNTER AND HERBAL
MEDICATIONS FOR MY PATIENTS,
UM, TO TRY TO TREAT THEM
MORE HOLISTICALLY.
AND NOTHING HAS BEEN AS
IMPRESSIVE AS SCALP MED.
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE FACT
THAT YOU ARE GROWING YOUR OWN
HAIR BACK, THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING
AND THIS IS ANOTHER SITUATION
WHERE I'M PRESCRIBING SOMETHING
THAT I KNOW WORKS.
SO, TRY IT, USE IT AND GROW YOUR
HAIR BACK.
>> YOU KNOW, PROBABLY THE MOST
AMAZING PART OF THIS IS FOR...
FOR TWO YEARS, I USED THE NUMBER
ONE PRODUCT THAT DOCTORS
RECOMMEND FOR HAIR LOSS-- THE
ONE THEY DOCUMENT, SAYING, YOU
KNOW, "THIS IS THE THING THAT'LL
MAKE YOUR HAIR STOP FROM FALLING
OUT AND IT'LL MAKE IT GROW."
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT IT DID TO ME
IS IT BASICALLY LEVELED IT OFF.
IT JUST STOPPED.
AND THEN FOR TWO MONTHS
I'VE TAKEN SCALP MED, AND HAD
NO SIDE EFFECTS AND GREW ALL
MY HAIR BACK, AND... YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST WONDERFUL.
>> WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO NOT BE
THE PERSON IN YOUR GROUP WHO'S
LOSING THEIR HAIR?
THE DIFFERENCE A HEALTHY
HEAD OF HAIR MAKES IN YOUR
APPEARANCE AND YOUR CONFIDENCE
IS PRICELESS.
SO HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU
GONNA WAIT?
BECAUSE THERE'S FINALLY A
SOLUTION, AND IT WORKS FOR BOTH
MEN AND WOMEN.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY
WORD FOR IT, BECAUSE AS PART OF
THIS SPECIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH, YOU
CAN TRY SCALP MED FOR 60 DAYS.
NOW, USE ALL OF IT, AND IF YOU
DON'T SEE YOUR HAIR LOSS STOP,
IF YOU DON'T SEE NEW HAIRS,
THICKER HAIRS, HEALTHIER HAIRS
IN JUST 60 DAYS, YOU CAN RETURN
THE EMPTY BOTTLES FOR A COMPLETE
REFUND OF THE ENTIRE
PURCHASE PRICE.
SO YOU SEE, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO RISK!
AND HERE'S HOW TO ORDER.
>> Announcer: IF YOUR HAIR IS
THINNING, OR GONE, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
PRESCRIPTION PILLS...
TOUPEES...
LASERS...
RISKY SURGERY...

CITY
ATTORNEY
MIKE

THE STORY.

THE
CITY
ATTORNEY
SPENT
TWO 
HOURS
LAYING
OUT
AN
ARGUMENT 
WE'VE
HEARD BEFORE.
THE
DEALS
WERE
A
CONSPIRACY
TO 
RAISE
BENEFITS
AND
UNDERFUND
A 
SYSTEM
CONTINGENT
ON
A
DEAL
BY 
THE
CITY
AND
THE
RETIREMENT 
BOARD.
THE
DEAL
WAS
OFFERED
BY
FORMER 
CITY
MANAGER,
JACK MAGROERY.
>>
THE
CITY
AND
THE
BOARD
ALL 
WORKED
TOGETHER
TO
CREATE
A 
SINGLE
INTEGRATED --
>>
THE
JUDGE
BARTON
INDICATED 
TO
BE
WOULD
BE
DIFFICULT
TO 
ISSUE
A
FINAL
RULING
BECAUSE 
THE
DEAL
RAISED
TOO
MANY 
QUESTIONS.

IF
THAT'S
THE
CASE
THE 
CONTRACT
IS
AMBIGUOUS
BY 
DEFINITION.

TO
DETERMINE
THE TERMS.

TO
DO
THAT
ON

JUDGMENT
WOULD
BE-I.

WAS
ALSO
LEERY 
ABOUT
MAKING
A
DECISION
THAT

IMPACT

SUCH
AS
THE 
POLICE UNION.
AND
NOTED
IT
WAS
THE
CITY 
COUNCIL
AND
NOT
THE

BOARD
THAT
CREATED
THE DEBT.

THE
CITY
IS
COMING
TO
COURT 
SAYING
WE
DID
WROK,
WE 
VIOLATED
THE
DEBT
LIMIT,
LET 
US
OFF
THE
LOOK
FOR
OUR
OWN 
WRONGDOING.
>>
AGUIRRE
SAID
THE
CITY
HAS 
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE OUTCOME.
AND
SUGGESTED
APPOINTING
A 
DEBT
MASTER
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE 
BENEFITS.
>>
ALL
THE
ISSUES
THE
CITY 
RAISE
GO
TO
MOTIVE,
NOT
TO
THE 
CONTRACTS THEMSELVES.

THERE
HAS
BEEN
NOT
EVEN
A 
SUGGESTION
THAT
THE
MOUs 
EXECUTED
BETWEEN
THE

WERE
IN

WAY 
AGAINST

THE

IN
BLUE
JEANS, 
DISCUSSING
IF
YOU
CAN
FORCE
A 
WORLD
CUP
BETTOR
TO PAY.
AND
REASONS
WHY
PEOPLE
ARE 
OVERWEIGHT.
WHY
PEOPLE
MACK
ON
U 
AMERICA'S FIRST NAME 
IN AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION,
FORD, IS WORKING TOGETHER
WITH THE WORLD'S MOST TRUSTED
NAME IN AUTOMOBILE SAFETY, 
VOLVO,
ON A COMMON MISSION...
DEVELOPING BREAKTHROUGH

KEEP FAMILIES SAFER

WE'RE RENEWING OUR COMMITMENT

THIS
IS,
YOU
KNOW,
COULD
APPLY 
TO
WORLD
CUP
SOCCER
OR 
FOOTBALL
OR
APPLY
TO
A

OF 
THINGS.
WHAT'S
THE DEAL?
>>
FIRST
OF
ALL,
BE
CLEAR,
CAN 
YOU
SUE
ANYBODY
FOR ANYBODY.
THAT'S
WHAT
WE
DO
IN
OUR 
SOCIETY.
>>
Dan:
SOMETIMES
WE
CALL
THEM 
FRIVOLOUS.

WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
YOU
TAKE 
A
BET
TO
THE
NEXT
DEGREE
SUCH 
AS
GOING
TO
COURT
AND
SUING 
YOUR
FRIEND
FOR
A
HUNDRED 
DOLLARS,
AND
CAN
YOU WIN?
THE
ANSWER
IS
YOU
DON'T
HAVE
A 
SHOT.
EVEN
IF
YOU
WON
THE
GAME
OR 
THE
MATCH
OR
WON
WHATEVER
IT 
IS.
IT'S
AN
ILLEGAL CONTRACT.
IT'S
A
VOID CONTRACT.
AND
WHEN
IT'S
ILLEGAL
IN
THIS 
STATE
LIKE
IN
CALIFORNIA
TO 
BET
WITHOUT
GOING
THROUGH 
SYCUAN
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT, 
YOU
DON'T
DON'T
HAVE
A CHANCE.
THAT'S
DISTINGUISHABLE
FROM
A 
VOIDABLE
CONTRACT
WHERE 
SOMEONE
CAN
HAVE
A
CHANCE
OF 
WINNING,
WHERE
IT'S
AN
OPTION 
BY
ONE
PARTY
TO
VOID
A 
CONTRACT.
SUCH
AS
A
MINOR
F
YOU'RE
UNDER 
18,
A
MINOR
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO 
ENFORCE
THE CONTRACT.
BUT
IN
THIS
STATE
YOU
HAVE
NO 
CHANCE.
THE
LAW
WILL
STAY
I
DON'T
WANT 
TO
DEAL
WITH IT.
IT'S ILLEGAL.
>>
Dan:
BETING
IS
ILLEGAL
IN 
CALIFORNIA.
SO
HOW
CAN
YOU
ENFORCE 
SOMETHING?
IT'S
LIKE
SAYING
YOU
WENT
TO 
THE
CORN
TORE
BUY
DRUGS
FROM 
SOMEBODY,
SOME
COCAINE,
AND 
YOU'RE
SUING
HIM
BECAUSE
IT 
WAS SUGAR.
>> YEAH.
YOU
BOTH
GO
TO JAIL.
POLICE
SHOW
UP
AND
SAY,
WAIT
A 
MINUTE.
BUT
THE
REALITY
IS,
THAT'S 
RIGHT.
WHEN
YOU
BET
ON
ILLEGAL 
ACTIVITY,
THE
COURT
IS
NOT 
GOING
TO
SANCTION THAT.
>>
Dan:
WE
HEAR
A
LOT
ABOUT 
FANTASY
FOOTBALL,
AND
I 
UNDERSTAND
FANTASY
FOOTBALL
IS 
A
BILLION
DOLLAR
BUSINESS 
AROUND
THE
WORLD
RIGHT NOW.
WHAT
ABOUT THAT?
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
PLAYING 
FANTASY FOOTBALL.
SAY
YOU
PLUNK
DOWN
$10,000
FOR 
A GAME.
IS
THE
GROUP
SAYING
WE'RE
NOT 
GOING
TO
PAY YOU.
OR
BETING
ON
THE INTERNET.
TAKING
THE
QUESTION
A
STEP 
FURTHER.
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE,
MILLIONS
AND 
MILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
BET
ON
THE 
INTERNET,
FANTASY
FOOTBALL
AND 
THOSE THINGS.
THOSE
ARE
OFFSHORE
BETTING 
ORGANIZATIONS.
THOSE
ARE
OUT
OF
STATE,
OUT
OF 
COUNTRY,
AND
THE
ANSWER
AGAIN 
IS
IT'S
REALLY
--
IT'S
IN
THE 
COURTS
NOW,
BUT
IT'S ILLEGAL.
TECHNICALLY
SPEAKING
IT'S 
ILLEGAL.
IT'S
NOT
NECESSARILY
BEEN 
ENFORCED
YET,
BUT
IF
YOU
WANT 
TO
TRY
TO
GET
YOUR
$20,000 
BACK
FOR
BETING
ON
THE
SUPER 
BOWL
THROUGH
THE
INTERNET, 
GOOD
LUCK TRYING.
CALIFORNIA
IS
GOING
TO
SAY
GET 
AWAY.
>>
Dan:
WHY
DOES
ANYBODY
PAY 
UP EVER?
>>
BECAUSE
THEY'RE
MAKING
SO 
MUCH
PROFIT,
THEY
WANT
PEOPLE 
TO
BE
SUCK
SBOD
THIS
THING,
SO 
THEY
ENCOURAGE
YOU
TO
BE
ON 
THE INTERNET.
>>
Dan:
ANOTHER
QUESTION
CAME 
IN.
WHAT
IF
YOU'RE
NEIGHBOR
IS 
PLAYING
THE
MUSIC
TOO LOUD.
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
YOU
IT 
LEGALLY
FORCE
HIM
TO
SHUT
IT 
DOWN?
>>
YES,
CAN YOU.
THE
MAGIC
NUMBER
IS
11:00
AT 
NIGHT,
AND
YOU
CAN'T
SHUT
HIM 
DOWN,
BUT
IF
IT'S
A
PUBLIC 
NUISANCE
WHERE
IT'S
DISTURBING 
THE
NEIGHBORS,
CAN
YOU
CALL 
THE
POLICE,
AND
FURTHER
THAN 
THAT,
YOU
CAN
GET
A 
RESTRAINING
ORDER
AND
CALL
THE 
POLICE.
THEY
WILL
HANDCUFF
HIM
AND 
TAKE
HIM
TO JAIL.
>>
Dan:
IS
THERE
A
DECIBEL 
LEVEL?
>>
IT'S
THE
REASONABLENESS 
THING.
IS
IT REASONABLE?
IF
YOU
HAVE
YOUR
RADIO
ON
SO 
SOFT
THAT
NOBODY
ELSE
CAN
HEAR 
IT, NO.
BUT
IF
IT'SIC
WAING
UP 
NEIGHBORS
AND
DISTURBING 
PEOPLE
YOU
HAVE
EFRDS,
YOU
CAN 
GO
CIVIL
OR CRIMINAL.
AND
YOU
CAN
GO
TO
SMALL
CLAIMS 
COURT
AND
SUE
FOR DAMAGES.
>>
Dan:
WE'LL
THROW
YOU
A
CURB 
BALL HERE.
TURKO

APARTMENT
COMPLEX
SAYS
THE 
CHILDREN
CAN
NO
LONGER
PLAY 
OUTSIDE
AFTER
6:00
AT NIGHT.
AND
THEY'RE
ENFORCING THIS.
THE
CHILDREN
WHO
LIVE
THERE, 
WHOSE
PARENTS
PAY
RENT, 
THEY'RE
SAYING
YOU
HAVE
A 
CURFEW.
IT'S
A
PRIVATE
APARTMENT 
COMPLEX.
YOU
HAVE
A
CURFEW
AND
THE
KIDS 
HAVE
TO
BE IN.
>>
AND
THEY
CAN'T
PLAY
IN
THE 
COMPLEX?
>>
Dan:
OUTSIDE
THE COMPLEX?
>>
I
THINK
THERE'S
A 
CONSTITUTION
QUESTION THERE.
>>
Dan:
SIDEWALKS
ARE
PUBLIC 
PROPERTY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I
CAN'T
EVEN
--
WE'LL SEE.
BUT
MY
GUT
REACTION
IS
YOU 
KNOW
WHAT,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
THAT
IS RIDICULOUS.
AND
LEGALLY
SPEAKING
THE 
CONSTITUTION
WOULD
PROTECT 
THEM.

LOOK
INTO THAT.

WHAT'S
YOUR NAME?

BOB WILLARD.

WHAT
YOU

SO
GREAT 
FOR

AN

BACK

MIGHT
HAVE

IT
ON

YES
I'M
THE
FIRST
FEMALE 
FIRE
CHIEF,

IT'S 
RECOGNIZING
WHAT
I 
ACCOMPLISHED
THROUGHOUT
MY 
CAREER,
AND
I
WAS
THE
RIGHT 
PERSON.

Susan:
DOESN'T
IS
SENLD
A 
MESSAGE
TO
YOUNG
GIRLS,
AND
IN 
GENERAL
ABOUT
THE
UPPER
RANKS 
OF
THE
FIRE DEPARTMENT?

I
THINK
IT DOES.
I'VE
HAD
YOUNG
WOMEN

FIREFIGHTERS
COME
UP,
AND 
ACROSS

CONGRATULATE 
ME
ON

Dan:
NORMALLY
WHEN

SUSAN

THEY
LOVE
THE
FIREMAN
THING, 
AND
USUALLY
IT'S
THE
LITTLE 
BOYS
AND
NOT
THE
LITTLE GIRLS.
>>
THROUGH
MY
CAREER
I'VE
BEEN 
IN
THE
COMMUNITY,
I'VE
BEEN
A 
ROLE
MODEL,
A MENTOR.
IT'S
A
GREAT
OPPORTUNITY,
AND 
I
THINK
IT
SENDS
A
MESSAGE
YOU 
CAN
BE
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
TO 
BE.
WORK
HARD
AND
OPPORTUNITY 
PRESENTS ITSELF.
>>
YOU
TALK
ABOUT
THE 
HARTSHIPS
IN
THE
CITY,
AND
YOU 
HAVE
A
PRIORITY
BASED PLAN.
WHAT
IS
YOUR
NUMBER
ONE 
PRIORITY NOW?
>>
THE
NUMBER
ONE
PRIORITY
FOR 
THE
NEXT
FISCAL
YEAR
IS
TO 
DEVELOP
A
SPEBDING PLAN.
MAYOR
SANDERS
HAS
GIVEN
US
A 
REASONABLE
AMOUNT
OF

ESSENTIALLY,
WHAT
ARE

TELL
HER,

--
HE 
SAID
I'LL
LET
HER
ESTABLISH 
HER
OWN
STYLE,
AND
TOOS
WHAT 
LEADERSHIP
IS ABOUT.
WHAT'S
YOUR STYLE?
>>
IT'S
BASICALLY LEADERSHIP.
I
LIKE
TO
LISTEN
AND
HEAR
THE 
ISSUES.
IF
THERE'S
AN
ISSUE,
LISTEN
TO 
BOTH
SIDES
AND
FIND
A
COMMON 
GROUND.
BE
COLLABRATIVE.
I
THINK
THERE'S
AN
OPPORTUNITY 
TO
BUILD
SYNERGY
WITH
THE 
OTHER
DEPARTMENTS
IN
THE AREA.
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
FOCUS
ON 
THAT,
AND
THEN
REGIONAL,
AND 
SEE
WHAT
WE
CAN
LEVERAGE

ONCE
THEY
GET
ON

WE'VE
HAD
ONE

ELSEWHERE.
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
LOOK

THE

WENT

FROM
THE 
OTHER

WAS
DECLARED
SAFE 
AT SECOND.
THE
MANAGER
JOE
DID
HIS

PROCEEDED
TO
UPROOT 
THE

TYPICAL
FOR

TANTRUMS TOO.

SEEN

GOOD MORNING.
I
THINK
THERE'S
A
LITTLE 
DEBATE
GOING
ON,
BUT
I
WOULD 
CAUTION
PEOPLE
PLEASE
TAKE 
YOUR
MEDICATIONS
THE
WAY
THE 
DOCTOR RECOMMENDED.
THERE'S
A
PURPOSE
WHY
HE
OR 
SHE
DICTATE
THAD COURSE.
BECAUSE
WE'RE
LOOKING
AT
THE 
NUMBER
OF
DAYS
WHICH 
POTENTIALLY
COULD
BE
THE 
TREATMENT
FOR
SAY
A
CLASS
OF 
INFECTIONS
LIKE
URINARY
TRACT 
INFECTIONS,
DON'T
CHANGE
THE 
GAME
PLAN
WITHOUT
DOCTOR'S 
APPROVAL.
>>
Dan:
APPARENTLY
THERE'S
A 
STUD
THEY
SAID
YOU
DON'T
HAVE 
TO
FINISH THEM.
BUT
IT'S
A
SMALL STUDY.
>>
AND
HOW
MANY
TIMES
HAVE
WE 
SAID
DON'T
JUMP
ON
THE
FIRST 
STUDY
THAT
COMES OUT.
IT
WAS
AN
INTERESTING
STUDY 
THAT
LOOKED
AT
PNEUMONIA.
AND
THIS
STUDY
LOOKED
AT
A 
SHORTER
PERIOD
OF
TIME,
EVEN
A 
THREE
DAY
COURSE
CLAIMING
TO 
GET
SIMILAR RESULTS.
I'D
WATCH
THAT CLOSELY.
>>
Dan:
ARE
THEY
USING
A 
STRONGER
VERSION
OF
THE

ANTIBIOTIC?
>> NO.
A
MILD CASE.
BUT
I'D
BE
VERY
CAUTIOUS, 
FOLKS.
I
HAVE
PROFOUND
RESPECT
FOR 
PNEUMONIA,
AND
I
WOULD
TAKE 
YOUR
FULL
COURSE
OF

ANTIBIOTICS.
WE
STILL
HOSPITALIZE 
PNEUMONIA,
AND
I
WOULD
CAUTION 
THAT
IF
YOU
READ
SOMETHING
IN 
THE
PAPER
THAT
SAYS
MAYBE
IT 
COULD
BE
TREATED
FOR
A
SHORTER 
PERIOD
OF TIME.
DON'T EXPERIMENT.
MAKE
SURE
THIS
IS
WHAT
THE 
DOCTOR RECOMMENDS.
>>
Dan:
WE
HEAR
WHEN
YOU
TAKE 
ANTIBIOTICS,
SOME
PEOPLE
BUILD 
UP
A
RESISTANCE
TO
THE

ANTIBIOTICS
AND
THAT
THE 
DISEASE
SORT
OF
GROWS
STRONGER 
AND STRONGER
>>
I
THINK
THAT'S
A
VERY 
LIMITED PICTURE.
I
THINK
WHAT
WE'RE
TRYING
TO 
SAY
MORE
IN
GENERAL
IS
THAT
AS 
A
COMMUNITY,
IF
WE
ALL
TAKE 
ANTIBIOTICS
WITHOUT
REGARD
OF 
THEIR
ACTUAL NEED.
WE'RE
GOING
TO
DEVELOP
A 
RESISTANCE
IN
THAT
PARTICULAR 
BACTERIAL GROUP.
SO
WE
WILL
SEE
EMERGENCE
OF, 
AND
ALREADY
ARE,
THE
STAFF 
RESISTANCE
ANTIBIOTICS
IN
THE 
COMMUNITY
AND
HOSPITALS,
AND 
RESISTANCE
TO
TUBERCULOSIS
AND 
OTHER EXAMPLES.
SO
WE
WANT
TO
BE CAREFUL.
NOW
OBVIOUSLY
WE
WANT
TO
TREAT 
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO
TRULY
HAVE 
INFECTIONS.
BUT
EVERY
TIME
WE
GET
A
COUGH 
AND
A
COLD,
FOLKS,
IT
MAY
NOT 
BE
NECESSARY
TO
TAKE
AN

ANTIBIOTIC.
CHECK
IT OUT.
>>
Dan:
DO
YOU
THINK
SOMETIMES 
THEY'RE OVERPRESCRIBED?
>>
I
THINK
THAT HAPPENS.
IP
THINK
IT
HAPPENS
FOR
A 
VARIETY
OF REASONS.
SOMETIMES
THE
PATIENT
--
THE 
DOCTOR
IS
IN
A
JAM
AND
LEAVING 
FOR
TRAVELING
ABROAD
THE
NEXT 
DAY,
AND
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
AT 
THE
PERSON
AND
SAYING
GOSH,
I 
DON'T
WANT
THEM
TO
DEVELOP 
PNEUMONIA
WHILE
THEY'RE 
TRAVELING,
AND
SO
YOU
MAKE
A 
PROJECTION.
AT
THE
SAME
TIME,
SOME
OF 
THESE,
AND
19
IT'S VIRUSES.
AND
VIRUSES
IN
THE
RESPIRATORY 
SYSTEM
DON'T
RESPOND
TO

ANTIBIOTICS
PER SE.
>>
Dan:
WHAT DOES?
>>
WELL,
THE
VIRUS
IS
THE
BODY 
HEALING
ITSELF,
AND
OF
COURSE, 
NUTRITION
AND
WATCHING
FOR
A 
SECONDARY
BACTERIAL
INFECTION 
WHICH
IS
ANOTHER
PART
OF
THE 
EVASION.
PATIENTS
COME
BACK
IN,
AND
IT 
MAY
BE
A
VIRUS,
BUT
IF
THERE'S 
A
SECONDARY
INFECTION
LIKE 
SINUS
OR
EAR
INFECTION,
THEY 
MAY
COME BACK.
DOC,
I
TOLD
YOU
I
WAS
SICK, 
AND
YOU
DIDN'T
GIVE
ME
AN

ANTIBIOTIC.
USE
OUR
JUDGMENT
AND 
UNDERSTAND
THAT
WE
DO
WANT
TO 
LOOK
AT
ANTIBIOTICS
AS
A 
RESOURCE,
AND
IT'S
NOT
TO
BE 
WASTED.
WE
TOPT
USE
IT
WHERE
IT'S 
APPROPRIATE.
WE
TREAT
THOSE
WHO
NEED
TO
BE 
TREATED
FOR INFECTIONS.

INCLUDING
THE

THE
CAMERAS,
AND
WORKING,
AND 
THEY
HAVE
THIS
CAN'T
CAM 
REMARKS
ACTUALLY
A
CAPSULE 
WITH
THE
CAMERAS INSIDE.
>>
ABSOLUTELY,
AND
THE
THING 
WEIGHS
OVER
1200
POUNDS,
AND 
THERE'S
ONLY
THREE
MINUTES
OF 
FILM.
EVERY
TIME
THEY
SHOOT
THREE 
MINUTES
THEY
HAVE
TO
BRING
IT 
TO
THE SURFACE.
>>
AND
ONE
THING
THAT'S 
IMPORTANT
IS
THE
TYPES
OF 
FISHES
THEY FOUND.
THEY
WENT
TO
VARIOUS
PARTS
OF 
THE
WORLD,
EXCEPT
ARE
THE 
GREAT
CORAL REEF.
AND
EVEN
LA JOLLA.

NINE
DIFFERENT

AND
THERE'S
A
SNEAK
PREVIEW 
FOR
ALL
THE CRITICS.

SORTS
OF
UNDERWATER 
CREATURES.
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE

LIEIC THAT.
IMAX
IS
ALSO EDUCATIONAL.
AND
THE
BIRCH
AQUARIUM,
LADIES 
AND
GENTLEMEN,
WE
KNOW
IT'S 
EDUCATIONAL TOOL.
WE
SHOULD
GET
MORE
CONNECTED 
TO
THE OCEAN.
>>
AND
FOR
THOSE
WHO
DON'T 
KNOW
ABOUT
THE BIRCH.
TELL
US
WHAT
IT IS.
>>
IT'S
A
WONDERFUL
AQUARIUM, 
AND
SHOWS
THE
ANIMALS
IN
THE 
OCEAN.
>>
WHY
DON'T
YOU
HOLD THAT.
WHAT
DO
WE
HAVE HERE?
>>
THAT'S
A
VIPER FISH.
YOU
SEE
THOSE TEETH.
VERY
SMALL
EYES
AND
LARGE 
TEETH.

WHERE
DO
YOU
FIND THAT?

AT
LEAST
5,000
FEET DOWN.

WHAT'S THAT?
>>
BANG TOOTH.
VERY FOREOESHS.
IT
LOOKS
--
FOUND
A
LOT 
DEEPER.
>>
AND
WILL
IT
ATTACK HUMANS?
>> NO.
>>
THEN
IT'S
A
NICE FISH.
>>
THIS
ONE
LOOKS
LIKE
AN 
INTERESTING SPECIES.
>>
THAT'S
A
WOLF EEL.
BUT
IT'S
REALLY
A FISH.
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
AN
EEL,
BUT

AND
THERE'S
BEAUTIFUL 
FOOTAGE
OF
THOSE
WOLF
EELS
AND 
THERE'S
LIVE

AT
THE 
AQUARIUM
YOU
CAN SEE.

IN
THE
HOLES 
LIKE
THE GOPHER.

THAT'S
THE
MOREY EEL.
THE
WOLF
EEL
LIVES
DEEPER

Susan:

THERE'S
GOING

ACTIVISTS
PLAN

STRETCHING
A
HALF

TO 
PROTEST
THE
THE

I
THINK
STRING
OF PROTESTS.
THIS
IS
THE
GROUP
OF
MINUTE 
MEN
ON
ONE
SIDE,
AND
ACTIVISTS 
ON
THE OTHER.
THE
MINUTE
MEN
SAY
THE 
GOVERNMENT
IS
DOING
NOTHING 
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THE
HIRING
OF 
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
AND
OTHERS
SAY
THEY'RE
NOT 
HURTING ANYONE.
>>
THEY
DO
THE
HARD
LABOR
IN 
THE COUNTRY.
THEY'RE
HERE
TRYING
TO 
INTIMIDATE
THEM
AND
TRY
TO 
STOP
THEM
FROM
MAKING
AN 
HONEST LIVING.
>>
WHAT
THEY'RE
DOING
IS 
CRIMINAL
AND
IN
VIOLATION
OF 
LABOR LAWS.
>>
IF
THE
ORDINANCE
PASSES, 
EMPLOYERS
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
TO 
REGISTER
WITH
THE
CITY
BEFORE 
HIRING
DAY LABORERS.
AND
ACTIVISTS
ARE
CALLING
IT 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL,
AND
PLAN
TO 
MAKE
THEIR
FEELINGS
KNOWN
AT 
THE
VISTA
CITY
COUNCIL 
MEETING.
SO
DO
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
OTHERS 
SIDE.

Susan:
I'M GOOD.

NORMALLY,
SUSAN,
WE
TALK
ABOUT 
THE
SHOES,
BECAUSE
I'M
CRAZY 
FOR
STILETTOS
AND
HIGH 
FASHION,
BUT
TODAY
WE'RE
GOING 
TO
TALK
ABOUT
COMFORT
AND 
QUALITY
FROM
MARMY
IN
FASHION 
VALLEY
NEXT
TO
THE
BURBERRY 
STORE
IT'S
RELATIVELY NEW.
SHERRY
WOLF
IS
THE DESIGNER.
AND
SHE'S
DESIGNED
SOME 
AMAZING THINGS.
IF
WE
PAN
DOWN
AND LOOK.
YOU'LL
BE COMFORTABLE.
THAT'S
WHAT
IT'S ABOUT.
IT'S
THE
WOVEN
AND LEATHERS.
THIS
IS
PRETTY,
BECAUSE
IT'S
A 
METALLIC SLIDE.
THE
QUALITY
THERE
IS
REALLY 
HIGH END.
AND
THE
BAG
THAT
GOES
WITH IT.
DO
YOU
LOVE THAT?
THE BAMBOO.
AND
IT'S
QUITE CUTE.
AND
THIS
WHOLE
LINE
OF
FRIEND 
TRENDS.
STRAWS,
AND
STONES
AND WEDGES.
TAHITIAN
PRINTS
AND
SO
FORTH 
WITH
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
GLITZ
AND 
SPARKLE.
SO
YOU
GET
SOMETHING
FOR 
EVERYBODY.
AND
AS
YOU
WORK
DOWN
THE 
TABLE.
WE
GET
SUMMER'S
HOTTEST

COLORS.
MANDARIN
ORANGES,
AND
ALL
THE 
CITRUS COLORS.
AND
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
ABOUT 
THE
SHOES
IS
THAT
THEY'RE 
SUPER COMFY.
THERE'S
SCAREAB
JEWELED PIN.
WHAT
A
NEAT TOUCH.
>>
ISN'T
THAT FUN.
OF
COURSE,
THAT'S
SO TROPICAL.
AND
THEN
MOVING
DOWN
ALL
THE 
WAY
HERE
IS
THE
WHITE
STORY, 
AND
THE
WHITE
IS
CLEAR
JEWELS, 
AND
MAYBE
AN
INDIAN
PRINT
OR 
SAFARI WE'LL.
ANYTHING
THAT
ADDS
A
LITTLE 
JEWEL
AND
MAKE
ITS
MORE PERKY.

Susan:

A 
MATCHING HANDBAG.

THE

TO JUBILEE.
THEY'RE
IN
A
DIFFERENT CLASS.
BUT FOLLYS
>>
Dan:
DO
THEY
WEAR CLOTHES.
>>
THEY
STARTED
AS
THE
FIRST 
TOPLESS SHOW.
>>
THEY
HAD
THEM
ON
ONE
TIME 
WITH
THE TOPS.
WITH
THE TOPS.

BUT
JUBILEE
IS
25
YEARS 
OLD,
AND
VERY,
VERY
LONG
WELL 
RESPECTED
RUN
IN VEGAS.

Dan:
AND
LOOKING
FOR 
NEW TALENT.

Susan:
THANK
YOU, PHIL.

Dan:
THAT
WAS GOOD.
A
BURGLAR
IN
FLORIDA
MADE 
QUITE
AN
SBRNS
INTO
A 
CONVENIENCE STORE.
IT
WAS
CAUGHT
ON VIDEOTAPE.
>>
Susan:
THE
MAN
CAME 
CRASHING
THROUGH
THE
CEILING, 
BUT
WAS
ABLE
TO
SHAKE
IT
OFF 
AND
GET
AWAY
WITH
A
THOUSAND 
DOLLARS.
>>
I
WAS
SURPRISED
THE
SUSPECT 
DBT
GET
HURT
JUDGING
BY
THE 
WAY
HE FELL.
>>
Dan:
THAT'S
A
LONG
WAY
TO 
GO.
NOW
IN
ADDITION
TO
GETTING
THE 
THOUSAND
DOLLARS,
THE
BURGLAR 
CAUSED
A
LOT
OF
DAMAGE
TO
THE 
STORE
AS
L
AND
RIPPED
A
HUGE 
HOLE
IN
THE
CEILING,
AND 
POLICE
ARE
HOPING
THAT
THE 
SURVEILLANCE
VIDEO
WHICH 
OBVIOUSLY
CAPTURED
HIM
IN
THE 
ACT
WILL
HELP
CATCH
HIM
SOME 
DAY.
GUESS WHAT?

AT
THE
REUBEN
H.
FLEET 
SCIENCE
STORE
WHETHER
YOU
COME 
TO
SEE
DEEP SEA.
SMOKERS CURB
THEIR CRAVINGS,
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
DOING MORE HARM
THAN GOOD.
WHY IT COULD
CREATE A WHOLE
NEW GENERATION OF
ADDICTS.
...TONIGHT AT
ELEVEN.
>>
Susan:
IT'S
A
DIFFICULT
DAY 
FOR
FAMILIES
OF
THE
NATIONAL 
GUARD TROOPS.
>>
Dan:
HUNDREDS
ARE
TAKING 
OFF SOON.
VIVIAN
TAMAYO
IS
LIVE
AT 
MIRAMAR
WITH
THE
TROOP
THIS
IS 
MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
>>
GOOD
MORNING, EVERYONE.
SHARING
THE
LAST
FEW
MOMENTS 
IN
SAN DIEGO.
WE
CAME
TO
MIRAMAR
AIRPORT
TO 
SAY GOOD-BYE.
THEY'RE
CALLED
THE SCORPIONS.
>>
GOOD
MORNING, KUSI.
>>
GOOD MORNING.
THEY'RE
ABOUT
TO
GO
TO 
MISSISSIPPI,
WHERE
THEY
WILL 
TRAIN
FOR
A
SERIOUS
MISSION
IN 
IRAQ
DOING
CONVOY DUTY?
>> YES.
SECURITY.
SECURITY, YES.
>>
SO
GOOD
MORNING
TO
YOU 
SPECIALIST
--
SERGEANT 
GONZALEZ.
HOW
ARE YOU?
>> WONDERFUL.
A
LITTLE TIRED.
BUT
READY
FOR
THE MISSION.
>>
IS
THIS
GOING
TO
BE
YOUR 
FIRST TOUR?
>> YES.
AND
IT
WON'T
BE
THE LAST.
WE'RE
GETTING
WONDERFUL 
TRAINING
IN
MISSISSIPPI
AND
IT 
WILL
PREPARE
US
FOR
THE
MIG 
AHEAD
OF US.
IT'S
GOING
TO
BE
HARD 
TRAINING.
IT'S
GOING
TO
BE
A
HARD 
MISSION.
>>
SPECIALIST
--
I
UNDERSTAND, 
SIR,
THAT
YOU
DIDN'T
ASK
YOUR 
WIFE'S
PERMISSION
BEFORE
YOU 
WENT
ON
THE
TOUR, RIGHT?
>>
I
DIDN'T ASK.
YEAH.
>>
SO
WHEN
YOU
GO
THERE,
WE'RE 
EXPECTING
YOU'RE
GOING
TO
BE 
LEAVE
LEADING
THE
MILITARY 
POLICE
AND
CONVOYS
ON
THE
ROAD 
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST 
DANGEROUS
PLACES,
ARE
YOU 
CONFIDENT
YOU'LL
BE
EQUIPPED 
WITH
ENOUGH
ARMOR
AND
WEAPONRY 
TO
PROTECT YOURSELF.
>> TOTALLY.
I
TRUST
MY
EQUIPMENT,
AND
I 
TRUST
MY
BUDDY
THAT
IS
I'M 
GOING WITH.
WE'LL
BE
WELL TRAINED.
>>
SO
SAYING
FWB
TO
THE
FAMILY 
IS
THE
HARDEST PART?
>>
IT
WAS ROUGH.
MY
DAUGHTER
CAME
TO
SEE
ME 
RIGHT
AFTER
BELEFT,
AND
SHE 
RAN
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
FORMATION 
AND
WAS CRYING.
IT
WAS HARD.
>>
I'M
SURE
IT IS.
AND
WE
ACTUALLY-HAVE
A
THE 
COMMANDER
OF
THE COMPANY.
HE
WILL
BE
LEADING
THE
TROOPS 
AS
THEY
GO
INTO
THAT
COMBAT 
AREA
IN
SOUTHERN IRAQ.
HOW
ARE
YOU, SIR?
>>
I'M
DOING
VERY
WELL, MA'AM.
HOW
ARE YOU?
>>
GREAT,
THANK YOU.
YOU
HAVE
THE
TOUGHEST
JOB
OF 
ALL.
WHAT
IS THAT?
>>
I'M
GOING
TO
LEAD
THESE 
GUYS
OVER
TO IRAQ.
I'LL
BE
THE
COMPANY COMMANDER.
SO
I'LL
BE
IN
CHARGE
OF
ALL 
THE
OPERATIONS
THEY
CONDUCT
IN 
IRAQ.
>>
AND
OF
COURSE,
THIS
IS 
PROBABLY
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS 
NITION
BECAUSE
THE
ROAD
SIDE 
BOMBS
OR
IEDs
HAVE
BEEN 
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
MOST
OF
THE 
CASUALTY
THAT
IS
WEAVE
SEEN 
FROM
OUR TROOPS.
WOULD
YOU AGREE?
>>
NOT REALLY.
WITH
THE
MEDIA
THAT'S
ALL
WE 
HEAR
ABOUT
ARE
THE
IEDs
AND
GO 
OFF.
WE
DON'T
HEAR
ABOUT
ALL
THE 
IEDs
WE
FIND
EVERY DAY.
WE
FIND,
30,
40,
50
A DAY.
AND
WE'RE
HAVE
TECHNOLOGY
TO 
MITIGATE
SOME
OF
THIS
WE
FIND 
ON
THE ROAD.
>>
THANK
YOU
FOR
JOINING
US 
THIS
MORNING
BEFORE
YOU
SAY 
GOOD-BYE
TO
ALL
OF THEM.
YOU'LL
BE
LEAVING
TOMORROW,
I 
KNOW,
AND
THE
TROOPS
LEAVING 
FOR
MISSISSIPPI
TODAY,
AND 
THEY
WON'T
BE
BACK
FOR
A 
WHILE.
THEY'LL
BE
GONE
UNTIL
DECEMBER 
OF
2007
AND
HEAD
OUT
ON
A
YEAR 
LONG
TOUR
OF IRAQ.
WE
WISH
THEM
THE
BEST
OF
LUCK, 
AND
OUR
PRAYERS
WITH
THEM,
OF 
COURSE.

ALL
OF

THERE
WAS
ACTUALLY
A
WAITING 
LIST
TO
GO
ON
THIS
MISSION, 
AND
THE
COMMANDER
GOT
TO
PICK 
AND
CHOOSE
WHO
TO
SELECT

GO 
ON
THE MISSION.
THESE
ARE
THE
MOST
QUALIFIED 
MEN,

CENTER
THIS 
MORNING.
RODNEY,
YUESH
UNDER
THE SEA.
(INAUDIBLE)
IT
MEANS
I'M
UNDER 
THE SEA.
WHEN
YOU
COME
TO
THE
REUBEN
H. 
FLEET
TO
SEE
A
GREAT
MOVIE 
CALLED
DEEP
SEA,
CAN
YOU
GO
TO 
THE
STORE,
AND
KIDS
TELL
MOM 
AND
DEAD
TO
GETS
NEW
STUFFED 
ANIMALS
FROM
UNDER
THE SEA.
VERY SERIOUS.
FIRST,
THANK
YOU
SO MUCH.
LET'S
TALK
ABOUT
THE SEA.
OUR
SEAS
ARE
IN TROUBLE.
ALL
OF
OUR
SEAS
ARE
IN 
TROUBLE?
>> YES.
GLOBAL
WARMING,
POLLUTION, 
OVERFISHING.
ALL
THE
WONDERFUL
ANIMAL
THAT 
IS
YOU
SEE
THIS
THE
BEAUTIFUL 
FILM
ARE
IN TROUBLE.
>>
YOU'VE
SEEN
THE
MOVIE
DEEP 
SEA.
AND
IT
HAS
DONE
L.
THEY
GO 
DOWN
500 FEET.
WE
SEE
THING
THAT
IS
WE
AREN'T 
GOING
TO
SEE
NORMAL DIVING.
>>
THIS
TAKES
SPECIAL
PEOPLE 
TO
FILM
A
MOVIE
LIKE
THIS
AND 
GET
THE FOOTAGE.
>>
NIGELLA,
CAN
WE
GO
FOR
A
-- 
THE SHARK.
I
WAS
IN
BIMINI
ONCE
DIVING, 
AND
THE
BIGGEST
PLACE
BESIDES 
BIMINI
WITH
THE
MOST
SHARKS
IS 
THE
GREAT
BARRIER REEF.
THE
SHARK
POPULATION,
WHAT'S 
IT
LIKE
OUT THERE?
I
UNDERSTAND
THEY
CAN
SURVIVE 
ANYTHING,
BUT
THEY'RE
-- 
BECAUSE
OF
GLOBAL
WARMING-I. 
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
KILL
SHARKS, 
AND
MAKE
SHARK
PIN SOUP.
SO
MILLIONS
OF
SHARKS
ARE 
KILLED
EVERY YEAR.
THEY'RE?
TROUBLE.
>>
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
FILM
IS 
TO
GET
US
IDICATEED
TO 
UNDERSTAND
IT MORE.
>>
THAT'S
THE IDEA.
SEEING
MOVIES
LIKE
THIS
AND 
GETTING
CONNECTED
TO
THE
OEG 
AND
GETTING
APPRECIATION
AND 
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
WONDERFUL 
SCAETURES
OF
THE OEG.
>>
WE
WANT
THEM
TO
COME
HERE 
TO
THE
REUBEN
H. FLEET.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AND
WE
TALKED
TO CRAIG.
CRAIG
LAWRIE,
YOU'RE
THE
COO 
HERE,
THE
MAN
RESPONSIBLE
FOR 
BRINGING
US
THESE
FINE MOVIES.
YOU'RE
NOT
GOING
TO
FIND 
BETTER.
>>
THEY'RE
THE
BEST
KNOWN 
UNDERWATER
PHOTOGRAPHERS
FOR 
IMACK
FILMS
OUT THERE.
THEY'VE
HAD
SEVEN
EMMYS 
BETWEEN THEM.
>>
YOU
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
GET 
THESE
FILMS
THE
MOMENT
THEY'RE 
READY.
THEY
FAVOR
THE
REUBEN
H.
FLEET 
CENTER.
>>
THERE'S
A
CACHET,
AND 
PEOPLE
LIKE
TO
SHOW
THEIR 
FILMS HERE.
>>
WE
TALK
ABOUT
DEEP SEA.
I
REMEMBER
THE
LAST
ONE 
INVOLVING
THESE
SAME
DIRECTORS 
WITH
THE
GREAT
BARRIER
REEF 
AND
CORAL
REEFS
AND
WHAT
HAVE 
YOU.
DO
WE
HAVE
MORE
ON
THE 
HORIZON?
IS
THIS
ONE
WE
CLOSE
OUT
THE 
KNOWLEDGE?
>>
THERE
WILL
BE
NEVER
BE
A 
CLOSE
OUT
OF
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF 
THE SEA.
I
KNOW
THEY R.
>>
I
KNOW
YOU
WANT
EVERYBODY 
TO
COME
SEE
THIS,
AND
AUS,
YOU 
WANT
TO
TELL
PEOPLE
SOMETHING 
ABOUT
THE
SEA
THAT
WILL
HELP 
US
APPRECIATE
IT MORE.
>>
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
GET
TO 
KNOW
OUR
OEG
BETTER
TO 
APPRECIATE
IT
AND
REALIZE
IT'S 
IN
TROUBLE
AND
WE
NEED
TO 
HELP.
>>
WHEN
I
SEE
OR
HEAR
ABOUT 
ALASKA
AND
OTHER
PLACES
IN
THE 
ANTARCTIC
WHERE
THE
ICE
MASSES 
ARE
BREAKING
UP
AND
THE
POLAR 
BEARS
ARE
IN
TROUBLE,
AND
IT 
IS
FISH
POPULATIONS
ARE
IN 
TROUBLE
AND
THE
CORAL
REEFS 
ARE
IN TROUBLE.
COME
SEE
THIS
AND
BE
THE
FIRST 
STEP
FOR
THOSE
NOT
EDUCATED 
IT'S
NEVER
TOO
LATE
TO
SAVE 
IT.
YOU'LL
APPRECIATE
CONSERVATION 
WHEN
YOU
SEE
THE BUETDY.

TO
BE
HONEST,
WE
EAT
LOTS 
OF
CHOCOLATE CAKE.
BUT,
WE
DO
HAVE
TO
TAKE
CARE 
OF

JOY WILL LOVE IT. 
[APPLAUSE]
HAVEN'T YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE

REGIS: ENOUGH TO WAKE JOY UP 
FIRST.
I WAS IN LOS ANGELES, HAD A GAD 
TIME.

EVERYBODY SAYS HELLO, JAY LENO, 
CRAIG FERGUSON, AND LARRY KING. 
WHY, REGIS? 
KELLY: AND WHAT DID YOU SAY TO

>> I SAID YOU'RE RIGHT, LARRY.
HE'S GREAT. 
AND INCIDENTALLY LARRY KING NOW

AUDIENCE. 
YES.
THE NIGHT I WAS THERE, IT WAS 
LAST FRIDAY NIGHT -- 
KELLY: MAYBE THEY JUST PUT THE 
AUDIENCE IN THERE FOR YOU SO YOU
WOULD FEEL AT HOME. 
REGIS: WELL, IT WASN'T EXACTLY 
AN AUDIENCE.
IT WAS ONE WOMAN SITTING THERE. 
BUT IT'S A BEGINNING. 
KELLY: DOES HE HAVE A CO-HOST?
REGIS: NOT YET. 
BUT SHE WAS A NICE LADY.
AND IT WAS FUN TO HAVE SOMEBODY 
ELSE. 
KELLY: TO LOOK AT BESIDES LARRY.
REGIS: OF COURSE. 
AND SUPERMAN WAS THERE THAT

KELLY: YES, BRANDON ROUTH.
AND HE'S HERE TODAY.
[APPLAUSE]
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE
FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS.
AND WHEN WE COME IN -- WHEN WE 
COME IN ARE THE HAMPTONS AND WE 
GO THROUGH THE TUNNEL, THERE'S 
THIS BIG "SUPERMAN" POSTER. 
IT'S LIKE A GIANT BILLBOARD.
HE'S LIKE SUPER.
HE'S JUST SUPER AND HE'S JUST 
EQUALLY SUPER DREAMY BACKSTAGE. 
>> THE REVIEWS ARE DREAMY, TOO. 
SUPER FOUR STARS ON THE "DAILY 
NEWS."

LARRY KING TOLD ME IT'S A GREAT 
MOVIE.
KELLY: SEEMS LIKE A GREAT GUY.
REGIS: GREAT STORY A YOUNG ACTOR

KELLY: YEAH.
"ONE LIFE TO LIVE."

[APPLAUSE]
REGIS: WORKED FOR ONE YEAR. 
WENT OUT TO LOS ANGELES.
DID A LOT OF JOBS, BARTENDING 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE, AND ALL OF 
A SUDDEN HAD A SIT-DOWN WITH 
BRIAN SINGER IN A LITTLE DELI IN
A COFFEE SHOP AND GOT THE MOVIE.
KELLY: IT'S GREAT.
I USED TO WATCH "ONE LIFE TO 
LIVE."
SO I SOMEHOW FEEL RESPONSIBLE.
WHEN I SAW HIM POP UP IN THE 
TRAILER -- 
REGIS: IT WAS YOUR DISCOVERY. 
KELLY: I WAS LIKE "ONE LIFE TO 
LIVE."
I KNEW IT.
I ALWAYS KNEW.
REGIS: PLAYED A LITTLE GOLF WITH
THE TRUMPSTER IN HIS NEW GOLF 
COURSE. 
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. 
HE BOUGHT IT. 
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. 
THEY HAD AN 18 HOLE RIGHT ON THE
OCEAN.
IT'S RIGHT ON THE COAST.
AND THE 18 HOLE ON THIS GOLF 
COURSE FELL INTO THE OCEAN. 
IT JUST DISAPPEARED.
PEOPLE THREW UP THEIR HANDS AND 
SAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
THE 18TH HOLE IS GONE.
KELLY: YOU CAN JUST PUT IT IN 
THE DRINK.
REGIS: AND TRUMPSTER FLEW OVER 
THE GOLF COURSE.
CAME DOWN.
BUT THE 18 HOLE IS GONE.
NO PROBLEM. 
WE'LL GET IT UP.
ANYWAY, HE GOT IT UP. 
AND RAISED HIS -- 
KELLY: MORE THAN ONCE, I'M TOLD.
[APPLAUSE]
REGIS: AND THEN HE BOUGHT THE 
GOLF COURSE AND SIX YEARS LATER,
IT'S MAG NIFFSEN. 
TWO AND A HALF MILES OF 
CALIFORNIA COASTLINE. 
KELLY: MARK IS GOLFING OVER AT 
HIS GOLF COURSE OVER HERE.
THE ONE THAT HE HAS HERE. 
WHAT'S IT CALLED? 
WEST CHESTER. 
THANK YOU.
REGIS: YEAH.
HE'S GOT ALL THE WATERFALLS.
WE WANT TO A WEDDING. 
BARRY GLAZER'S DAUGHTER GOT 
MARRIED.
AMANDA IS THEIR DAUGHTER. 
SHE'S AN AGENT. 
PAUL'S AGENCY AND SHE MARRIED 
JEFF, AN AGENT AT WILLIAM 
MORRIS. 
KELLY: HOW NICE, TWO AGENTS 
COMBINING THE GENE POOL.
FANTASTIC.
REGIS: YOU WOULD THINK THAT 
MIGHT BE A COMBUSTIBLE DUO. 
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR EIGHT 
YEARS.
AND THERE'S BARRY AND SUSAN.
KELLY: I LIKE HER GOWN. 
IT'S SO SEXY. 
REGIS: AND THEY HAD A LOT OF 
ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDING THE 
DANCING RABBIS. 
GELMAN: OH, YEAH. 
REGIS: THE DANCING RABBIS FROM 
THE WELL-KNOWN TELETHON IN LOS 
ANGELES, THE HABAD TELETHON.
HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON 
THEIR SHOW. 
GELMAN: YOU'VE BEEN ON THEIR 
SHOW. 
REGIS: YEAH.
THERE HE IS, BARRY TRYING TO 
DANCE A LITTLE BIT WITH THE 
RABBIS. 
AND THIS IS HIS TABLE ON THE 
DANCE FLOOR.
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE 
REGIS IS -- 
KELLY: YES. 
WHERE IS REGIS? 
REGIS: WELL, IN BETWEEN HIS BEST
FRIENDS, CHARLIE AND BOBBY, WAY 
BACK THERE, WAY IN THE CORNER, 
THE LAST TABLE FLUSHED AGAINST 
THE WALL. 
KELLY: NEXT TO THE TOILET.
REGIS: NEXT TO THE TOILLET IN 
THE DARKNESS, YOU COULD SEE 
REGIS AND JOY.
KELLY: WOW. 
[APPLAUSE]
THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T MEAN 
ANYTHING. 
IT WAS JUST AN OVERSIGHT. 
REGIS: DOES IT MEAN SOMETHING 
WHEN YOU KNOW?
KELLY: JUST BECAUSE YOU TOOK 
THEM TO THE VERSACE MANSION 
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET PRIVATE 
SEATING IN THEIR WEDDING. 
REGIS: AND 18 CRUISES AROUND THE
WORLD.
KELLY: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR 
HIM LATELY? 
REGIS: YES. 
RIGHT.
OK. 
I CAN TAKE THE HINT.
SO ANYWAY, THE WEATHER HAS BEEN 
SOUPY BUT IT MADE MY VACATION UP
THERE.
KELLY: I KNOW.
I THINK OF YOU BECAUSE I KNOW 
WHEN IT'S RAINING AND LIGHTNING 
BOLTS ARE COMING OUT OF THE SKY 
STRIKING HOUSES AND BUILDINGS IN
NEW YORK, YOU ARE NEVER MORE 
ALIVE WHEREVER IT IS THAT YOU 
ARE.
REGIS: EVERY MORNING. 
KELLY: YOU'RE FILL WAD SENSE OF 
PEACE AND CALM AND JOY BECAUSE 
WE ARE IN GRAVY IN NEW YORK.
REGIS: THE FIRST THING I DO WHEN
I GET MY NEW YORK PAPER IN THE 
MORNING, I GO RIGHT TO THE 
WEATHER PAGE, T-STORM, T-STORM, 
T-STORMS. 
FOUR DAYS IN A ROW WE GET 
T-STORMS. 
YES!
KELLY: THAT IS A MENTAL PROBLEM.
YOU ARE APPLAUDING A 
DEEFFICIENCY. 
YES.
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WOULD SAY 
DEFFICIENTE.
REGIS: I WORRY ABOUT YOU GETTING
TO WORK AND LEAVING IN THE RAIN.
KELLY: WHEN I'M ON VACATION AND 
HEAVEN FORBID IT'S SUNNY IN NEW 
YORK, I'M BENT OUT OF SHAPE.
I'M UPSET.
I'M LIKE IT'S SUNNY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S SUNNY IN 
SUNNY AND 85. 
I CAN'T BE SUNNY AND 85 WHEN I'M
AWAY. 
I CAUGHT IT FROM YOU. 
REGIS: I KNOW.
BUT IT DOES MAKE YOU SUFFER.
KELLY: AFTER ALL THE PEOPLE ARE 
SUFFERING WHEN YOU DON'T. 
REGIS: U.S. POPULATION IS ABOUT 
TO EXPAND TO 300 MILLION 
RESIDENTS.
300 MILLION AND WE'RE EXPECTING 
ONE THIS FALL.
THE BABY OF -- THE BABY OR 
IMMIGRANT WHO NOTCHES THE 
LANDMARK NUMBER LIKELY TO BE 
HISPANIC AND FOR THAT ETHNIC 
GROUP CRTS NEARLY HALF OF THE 
NEW POPULATION. 
KELLY: THAT'S THE WAY IT IS IN 
OUR HOUSE, I'M JUST SAYING, OK? 
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR HALF OF THAT
HALF. 
REGIS: IT TOOK JUST 39 YEARS TO 
ADD THE ADDITIONAL 100 MILLION 
TO OUR POPULATION.
THE LAST TIME WAS 200 MILLION IN
1967. 
YOU KNOW THAT PEPPY LITTLE DOG 
ON "FRAZIER,."
HE PASSED.
16 1/2. 
THE NAME WAS MOOSE. 
A JACK RUSSELL TERRIER. 
KELLY: I'VE SEEN PEOPLE REACT 
WITH LESS DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN AN
ACTUAL PERSON DIES. 
REALLY. 
REGIS: YEAH, YOU CAN SAY. 
PEOPLE GIVE YOU THIS. 
UH-HUH. 
KELLY: YEAH, UH-HUH.
REGIS: BUT THE DOG DIED, OH, NO!
NO! 
KELLY: I GOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT 
MY DAY YESTERDAY. 
I WENT -- YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND 
THIS, BUT JOY, IF SHE'S WATCHING
WILL UNDERSTAND THIS. 
AND I HAVE BEEN SPOILED BECAUSE 
I WORK HERE AND SO I NEVER, UM, 
I NEVER BUY COSMETICS BECAUSE 
THEY JUST HAVE THEM ALL HERE. 
THEY JUST GIVE THEM TO ME.
REGIS: THEY STUFF IT IN YOUR 
POCKETS.
KELLY: THEY DO. 
YESTERDAY WAS A RAINY DAY.
DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH 
JOAQUIN.
WE WERE OUT SHOPPING BUYING 
THINGS AND I SEE A SEPHORA AND I
SEE THEY CARRY THIS YUMMY LIP 
GLOSS THAT I LIKE -- -- AND LOLA
LIKES.
I GO AND GET THE LIP GLOSS. 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO SEPHORA?
YOUR HEAD CAN EXPLODE OFF OF 
YOUR BODY.
THERE'S SO MUCH STIMULATION.
IT IS LIKE A.D.D. FOR ADULTS. 
YOU'RE LIKE I WANT LIP GLOSS BUT
I MIGHT AS WELL BUY 15 DIFFERENT
FOUNDATIONS AND OH, LOOK, 
SHAMPOO AND A FLAT IRON.
THIS IS LIKE ME WANDERING.
I START TO WANDER AROUND. 
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT I 
SPENT WAY TOO MUCH MONEY 
YESTERDAY JUST TRYING TO BUY ONE
LIP GLOSS.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING AND I'M 
ASHAMED.
I COULDN'T FIND MY SHADE SO I 
BOUGHT SEVERAL OTHER SHADES THAT
I LIKE THAT WERE CLOSE. 
AND I MOVED ON TO THE 
FOUNDATION. 
THEN I BOUGHT SOME FALSE 
EYELASHES BECAUSE YOU NEVER 
KNOW. 
REGIS: ISLIP GLOSS THE SAME AS 
LIPSTICK? 
KELLY: NO, IT'S DIFFERENT.
LIPSTICK ISLIP GLOSS, THEY'RE 
DIFFERENT.
REGIS: DO YOU HAVE LIP GLOSS ON 
RIGHT NOW?
KELLY: I AM WEARING A LIP LINER 
WITH A LIPSTICK WITH A GLOSS ON 
TOP.
BUT YOU CAN WEAR ANY ONE OF THEM
BY THEMSELVES.
BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND IT. 
SO ANYWAY, I AM SEARCHING FOR 
SOMETHING.
DO YOU EVER GO SHOPPING.
IT'S LIKE BUYING FOOD WHEN YOU 
DON'T WANT TO EAT.
IT'S DANGEROUS. 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M 
SEARCHING FOR.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SEARCHING 
FOR.
AND BY GOD SOMETHING STRIKES ME 
IN THE FACE AND IT IS WHAT I'VE 
BEEN SEARCHING FOR. 
ARE YOU READY?
READ THIS NOW.
READ IT WITH ME.
THAT'S RIGHT. 
"WRINKLTS, -- "WRINKLES, 
PIMPLES, SPOTS."
IT'S A TREATMENT FOR WRINKLES, 
PIMPLES, AND SPOTS. 
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY PERSON 
THAT HAD PIMPLES, WRINKLES, AND 
SPOT, THERE'S A GROUP OF US THAT
HAS WRINKLES, PIMPLES, AND SPOTS
WHERE THEY HAVE A WALL IN THE 
STORE.
LISTEN TO THIS. 
SO I START READING. 
JOAQUIN IS STANDING NEXT TO ME. 
REGIS: POOR JOAQUIN.
KELLY: SO THEY'VE GOT SAMPLES 
HERE. 
I'M NOT NOTICING HIS FACE IS 
ORANGE AND GREEN AND PURPLE 
BECAUSE HE'S PUTTING SAMPLES ALL
OVER HIMSELF. 
DOES YOUR SKIN LOOKS LIKE IT HAS
A MULTIPLE PERSONALITY AND AS I 
SAID THAT, I LOOKED UP AND 
CAUGHT A GLIMPSE -- THEY HAVE 
MIRRORS THAT ARE EYE LEVEL 
EVERYWHERE. 
I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MYSELF AND
I THOUGHT I WAS A SALES HELP 
PERSON AND I SCARED MYSELF. 
I WAS LIKE -- HA! 
IT WAS ME WITH PIMPLES, 
WRINKLES, AND SPOTS.
NO MORE!
I'VE FOUND THE ANSWER.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW.
REGIS: IS THAT LIKE A MASK YOU 
PUT ON? 
KELLY: I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVEN'T BEEN OPENED YET 
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LIKE TOO WHAT 
IF IT DOESN'T WORK? 
THEN WHAT?
REGIS: WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF IT 
WORKS OR NOT. 
KELLY: OH, MY GOSH.

THE HEART IS AMAZING.
BUT HIGH CHOLESTEROL
CAN LEAD TO HEART DISEASE.
LIPITOR CAN HELP.
WHEN DIET AND EXERCISE
AREN'T ENOUGH,
ADDING LIPITOR SIGNIFICANTLY...
LOWERS BAD CHOLESTEROL,
39 TO 60 PERCENT.
IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL
COMMON RISK FACTORS...
FOR HEART DISEASE,
LIPITOR IS CLINICALLY PROVEN...
TO REDUCE YOUR RISK
OF HEART ATTACK.
AND MORE CARDIOLOGISTS

TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU ARE
TAKING OTHER MEDICATIONS...
OR IF YOU HAVE ANY
MUSCLE PAIN OR WEAKNESS.
THEY MAY BE A SIGN OF A RARE
BUT SERIOUS SIDE EFFECT.
LIPITOR IS ONE

FROM AUSTRALIA BUT THE 
NEWSPAPERS WERE WRONG.
>> NO, NO, I SADLY WASN'T 
INVITED.
KELLY: YOU WEREN'T INVITED TO 
THE WEDDING?
SO THEN THERE WAS NO HOPE OF 
YOU.
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL SO BAD.
REGIS: IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU

I KNOW YOU'RE PREPARING FOR 
ANOTHER SHAKE PETERSON PLAY IN 
THE PARK.

KELLY: DO YOU EVER GET INTIMATED
BY YOUR ROLES?
>> YEAH.
KELLY: I'M MERYL STREEP.
OF COURSE I CAN DO THIS.
>> THIS IS A BIG ONE. 
IT TAKES A LOT OF STAMINA.
MOSTLY I'M AFRAID OF AGE-RELATED
ISSUES. 
REGIS: HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT 
THIS ROLE IN "THE DEVIL WEARS 
PRADA"? 
>> IT WAS INTERESTING.
REGIS: YEAH.
BUT YOU HAVE FUN WITH YOUR 
CHARACTERS, DON'T YOU?
>> YEAH, I DID HAVE FUN 
SOMETIMES.
BUT IT ISN'T -- IT'S MORE FUN TO
WATCH HER BE A BIT -- 
REGIS: A BAD GIRL.
>> THAN IT WAS TO -- YOU'LL 
BLEEP ME, RIGHT?
A LITTLE DELAY. 
THAN IT IS TO PLAY HER BECAUSE 
IT'S A TINY LITTLE CORE OF 
UNHAPPINESS.
KELLY: AND YOU HAVE TO FEEL THE 
CORE OF UNHAPPINESS?
>> YEAH, YOU HAVE TO BE THE 
PERSON. 
SHE WASN'T ENTIRELY WONDERFUL.
REGIS: AND THE VOICES THAT YOU 
COME UP WITH, I MEAN, JUST 
FANTASTIC.
PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION IS AN 
EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU CAN DO. 
>> I LOVED THAT MOVIE.
I HAD A GREAT TIME.

AFRAID OF HER.

HER IN "HOPE & FAITH."
SHE'S A RIOT. 
REGIS: SHE IS A CHARACTER.
>> SHE IS A CHARACTER.
STANLEY SAID HE'S STILL 
EXHAUSTED FROM THE EXPERIENCE.
KELLY: I REMEMBER WHEN "THE 
DEVIL WEARS PRADA" WAS IN THE 
SOUND STAGE NEXT DOOR TO OUR 
SOUND STAGE AND FOR SOME REASON,
SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN. 
YOU KNOW, THINGS HAPPEN.
TELEVISION. 
AND SHE WOULD GO "YOUR DRESS IS 
TORN. 
DON'T WORRY, I'M GOING TO RUN 
NEXT DOOR TO THE PRADA SET AND 
I'M GOING TO GRAB YOU ONE OVER 
THERE." 
AND SHE WOULD COME BACK WITH THE
DRESS.
AND I WOULD SAY "WAS MERYL 
STREEP WEARING THIS?" 
>> NO, DARLING. 
IN MY DREAMS. 
KELLY: IT'S LIKE THE LETTING HER
ACTING TRANSFER TO ME.
>> NO.
SHE HAD A GIGANTIC JOB, TO BE 
FAIR. 
MY GOD. 
SO MANY WOMEN TO DRESS AND MEN 
TO DRESS AND SHE HAD NOT ENOUGH 
REALLY MONEY -- BECAUSE THESE 
CLOTHES ARE SO EXPENSIVE. 
KELLY: AND I READ IN THE PAPERS 
THAT A LOT OF DESIGNERS WERE 
AFRAID TO DIF THE CLOTHES OVER 
BECAUSE -- 
>> OH EVERYBODY GETTING THE 
CLOTHES.
KELLY: DID YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR 
STUFF?
>> NO.
WE AUCTIONED THEM OFF TO BENEFIT

>> IT IS A TOUGH QUESTION.
IT'S JUST HARD. 
I MEAN, I'VE JUST WORKED WITH 
SOME AMAZING PEOPLE.
REALLY AMAZING. 
AND I STEAL FROM THEM ALL.
IF YOU STEAL FROM BOYS, THEY 
DON'T NOTICE. 
KELLY: RIGHT. 
REGIS: BUT ITH SEEMS TO ME 
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BIG 
MOVIES, THE MOVIES THAT REALLY 
COUNT.
"CRAMER VS. CRAMER" IN 1979.
[APPLAUSE]

>> HALLOWEEN NIGHT. 
REGIS: WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN 
YOU SEE THIS PICTURE "OUT OF 
AFRICA" WITH ROBERT REDFORD 
THERE?
[APPLAUSE]
SYDNEY POLLIC, I LOVE HIS -- POD
LACK, I LOVE HIS DIRECTION. 
ONE NIGHT, I WAS TELLING YOU THE
STORY ABOUT THE TRAIN, THAT 
LITTLE TRAIN, AND I GO WHERE IN 
THE WORLD DID YOU FIND THAT 
TRAIN IF HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF 
THE FIRST COMPUTER ANIMATED 
SCENES IN MOVIES. 
>> OH, THE SMALLEST ONE.
THEY ONLY HAD ONE CAR.
THEY HAD TO MAKE IT A WHOLE 
TRAIN.

OF US.
THERE'S A MAN CALLED THE PUPPET 
MASTER WHO WORKS BEHIND THE 
CAMERA. 
>> GELMAN.
KELLY: THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.
REGIS: WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A
SCENE FROM "THE DEVIL WEARS 
PRADA." 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HER COMING 
OUT OF THE DOOR AND ALL THE 
PEOPLE ON THE SCENE SCURRY. 
THAT WOMAN IS A TYRANT. 
SHE'S KILLER. 
HERE SHE COMES IN "THE DEVIL 
WEARS PRADA."
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S 
SO DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM AN 
APPOINTMENT.
>> I'M SO SORRY.
IT -- 
>> TELL SIMONE I'M NOT GOING TO 
APPROVE THAT GIRL.
I ASKED FOR CLEAN, SMILEY 
ATHLETIC, AND SHE SENT ME DIRTY,
TIRED AND PONCHY. 
AND ASK HIM TO PICK ME UP AT 
9:30 SHARP. 
I DON'T WANT DUCK WARS. 
AND CALL MY EX-HUSBAND THAT 
PARENT CONFERENCE IS FOR ADULT 
AND ASK HIM TO MEET ME THAT 
DINNER AT MY PLACE AND THEY'RE

WELL, BRANDON, WELCOME TO OUR 
SHOW. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. 
REGIS: I KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD 
WORK DOWN THE STREET HERE ON 
"ONE LIFE TO LIVE." 
YOU DREAMED ABOUT COMING ON THIS
SHOW. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I PASSED YOU ON THE STREETS A 
COUPLE OF TIMES.
KELLY: DID HE KNOW WHO YOU WERE?
>> NO, HE DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS A
GUY WHO WATCHES SOAPS PUNCH 
REGIS: YOU'RE RIGHT THERE, 
BUDDY.
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE -- IN THE GYM?
WE WORK OUT TOGETHER OVER AT THE
REEBOK CENTER?
>> YEAH.
I THOUGHT YOU ENJOYED WORKING IT
OUT.
REGIS: YOU SHOULD HAVE CAME OVER
AND SAID I'M GOING BE "SUPERMAN"
ONE DAY.
IT'S SOME FANTASTIC STORY.
ONLY IN OUR BUSINESS DOES THINGS
LIKE THIS REALLY HAPPENED.
YOU WORKED FOR THE SOAP FOR A 
YEAR AND WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA 
AND THINGS WERE A LITTLE SLOW.
SO YOU TOOK SOME ODD JOBS, HUH? 
>> YEAH, I BAR TENDED FOR THE 
LONGEST AMOUNT OF TIME BUT I DID
SOME BOX PACKING AS WELL WITH 
PEANUTS AND THAT KIND OF THING 
UP IN NORTHRIDGE, CALIFORNIA AS 
AN ODD JOB AND I GOT INTO 
BARTENDING WHICH I LEARNED HOW 
TO BAR TEND BEFORE I WENT ON THE
SOAP. 
TOOK A BARTENDING JOB.
AND THEN I PLAYED A BARTENDER 
AND USED THAT SKILL TO MAKE A 
LIVING. 
KELLY: WAS IT VERY HARD FOR YOU 
TO GO FROM -- SO YOU GET THE JOB
ON THE SOAP SO YOU MUST HAVE 
THOUGHT LIKE ALL OF US, THIS IS 
IT. 
I'VE ARRIVED. 
I'M HERE. 
AND NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE THE 
INDUSTRY BY STORM.
>> YEAH, WELL I THOUGHT THAT IT 
DEFINITELY PARLAYED INTO SOME 
WORK AND IT DIDN'T AFTER A YEAR.
I HADN'T BOOKED A SINGLE JOB 
AFTER THAT. 
SOME FOREIGN COMMERCIAL, I 
THINK.
BUT THAT WAS IT.
SO I HAD TO DO THE BAR TEND 
THING.
REGIS: SO HOW DID THIS MEETING 
HAPPEN BETWEEN YOU AND THE 
DIRECTOR? 
DID HE CALL YOU?
>> NO.
I HAD A PREVIOUS MEETING AND 
AUDITION AND SCREEN TEST WITH 
PREVIOUS DIRECTOR.
SO BRIAN HAD SEEN A TAPE, ONE OF
THOSE TAPES AND THAT PEAKED HIS 
INTEREST. 
AND SO HE WANTED TO SIT DOWN AND
-- BECAUSE THE SCRIPT WAS 
DIFFERENT.
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I COULD 
PIT INTO HIS SCRIPT.
SO HE TALKED FOR TWO HOURS AT A 
COFFEE SHOP THAT'S ON SUNSET, NO
LONGER THERE. 
AND THAT WAS GREAT. 
HE WENT TO AUSTRALIA TO LOCATION
SCOUT.
CAME BACK, WE DID SOME MORE 
AUDITIONS AND I SCREEN TESTED 
WITH HIM. 
KELLY: SO YOU'RE SITTING DOWN IN
THIS COFFEE SHOP. 
ARE YOU SICK TO YOUR STOMACH? 
DO YOU WANT TO THROW UP?
DO YOU THINK JUST GIVE ME THE 
JOB.
I'M NOT GOOD AT THESE INTERVIEW 
THINGS BUT IF YOU GIVE ME THE 
JOB, I CAN WEAR THE TIGHTS? 
>> WELL, I THINK I WAS SICK TO 
MY STOMACH BEFORE THE MEETING.
I HAD A MIGRAINE THAT MORNING 
WAKING UP NOT KNOWING I WAS 
GOING TO HAVE THE MEETING.
GOT THE CALL. 
THOUGHT I NEED TO GET BETTER. 
THANKFULLY THE HEADACHE PASSED. 
I WAS EXCITED THAT I WAS FEELING
BETTER. 
BUT AT THAT TIME IT HAD BEEN 
FIVE MONTHS SINCE THE AUDITION. 
SO I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT.
I WAS GOING INTO THE MEETING 
GOING TO FIGHT FOR MY 
OPPORTUNITY.
BUT THANKFULLY, I DIDN'T HAVE 
TO. 
BRIAN WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT MY 
POTENTIAL THAT MADE A GREAT 
CONVERSATION. 
REGIS: DIDN'T YOU ONCE GO TO A 
COSTUME PARTY DRESSED AS 
"SUPERMAN"? 
DIDN'T YOU THINK YOU WERE 
"SUPERMAN" THEN?
>> SUBCONSCIOUSLY, I WAS PUTTING
IT OUT THERE. 
YEAH, THE LUCKY STRIKE WHERE I 
WAS A BARTENDER.
WE HAD A CONTEST AND I WAS 
WORKING THAT DAY. 
ENOUGH PEOPLE TOLD ME I LOOKED 
LIKE CHRISTOPHER REEVE. 
AND I DRESSED UP AS CLARK 
KENT/"SUPERMAN" AND I DRESSED UP
AND EVERYBODY WAS FREAKED OUT BY
MY RESEMBLANCE. 
SO I WON $100.
REGIS: CAME IN HANDY. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK AND 
SHOW YOU A CLIP FROM "SUPERMAN."..~_~.~.~o.ovos?{?{?
[APPLAUSE]
REGIS: THAT'S OUR GUY,

PREMIERE OF "SUPERMAN" IN IOWA 
LAST NIGHT IN YOUR HOMETOWN?
>> YES. 
WELL, DES MOINES WHICH IS ABOUT 
FIVE MILES NORTH WHICH IS WHERE 
I'M FROM. 
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
REGIS: AND YOUR BROTHER'S A COP 
AND HE LED THE PROCESSIONS. 
>> YEAH.
HE KEPT ME SAFE.
ESCORTED ME THROUGH SECURITY OUT
OF DES MOINES.
IT'S A VERY SAFE PLACE. 
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT -- BUT IT 
WAS FUN TO HAVE HIM BE ABLE TO 
DO THAT.
KELLY: BUT HE MUST HAVE FELT 
LIKE HE WAS ON ANOTHER PLANET.
THERE YOU ARE.
YOUR YOUNGER OR OLDER BROTHER?
>> OLDER BROTHER. 
KELLY: THERE'S THIS KID BROTHER 
AND NOW HE'S ESCORTING HIM 
THROUGH TOWN. 
>> YEAH.
EVERYBODY'S REALLY EXCITED. 
ESPECIALLY HI, MOM, HI, DAD, HI,
GRANDMA.
EVERYBODY'S EXTREMELY EXCITED.
THINGS LIKE THAT DON'T NORMALLY 
HAPPEN IN DES MOINES. 
WE HAVE SOME GREAT ACTORS BUT WE
DON'T HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO 
THIS. 
KELLY: IT'S AMAZING AND YOU 
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DANA 
REEVE.
>> YEAH, HALFWAY THROUGH 
FILMING.
THAT WAS A YEAR AGO.
IT WAS GREAT. 
SHE SAID THAT YOU KNOW, SHE YOU 
KNOW, GAVE HER BLESSING THAT THE
FILM WAS BEING BEADMADE AND THAT
I WAS DOING IT AND REMARKING 
ABOUT MY LIKENESS TO CHRIS. 
AND SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF
NEAT. 
REGIS: WHAT'S IT LIKE PUTTING ON
A "SUPERMAN" SUIT?
KELLY: LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW. 
REGIS: WOULD YOU THINK THAT 
REGIS WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THAT 
SUIT? 
>> SURE.
[APPLAUSE]
I'VE SEEN YOU WORK OUT AT THE 
GYM.
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU COULD DO IT 
REALLY WELL.
YOU'VE GOT GREAT HAIR FOR IT. 
REGIS: WHO DO YOU WANT IN THAT 
SUIT? 
ME OR LARRY KING? 
>> OH, MAN. 
REGIS: HOW ABOUT JUST THE CAPE? 
LET LARRY HAVE THE TIGHTS.
SO ARE YOU ENJOYING ALL OF THIS,
BRANDON?
MY GOSH, THIS IS THE YOU KNOW, 
COULD BE THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF

REGIS: EVERYTHING EVERYBODY'S 
HAPPY "SUPERMAN'S" BACK.

THEY'RE EXCITED TO SEE ME.
THAT'S GOOD.
I WANT TO KEEP THAT GOING 
FOREVER.

PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. 
IT'S FANTASTIC TO BRING THAT TO 
PEOPLE NOT JUST HERE BUT

T. 
OBESITY,
SPEAKING
OF
OBESITY, 
A
NEW
REPORTER
IS
LOOKING
AT 
REASONS
WHY
SOME
MANY
OF
US 
ARE
SO FAT.
YOU
THINK
WE
EAT
TOO
MUCH,
AND 
NOT
EXERCISING ENOUGH.
WE'RE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT THAT.
IF
YOU'RE
FAT
AND
LOOKING
FOR 
AN
EXCUSE,
THE
OBVIOUS
REASON 
SENT
WHAT
WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
LACK
OF SLEEP.
INN
ARE
YOU
SEE,
WE
SHOULD
ALL 
WEIGH
5,000
POUNDS,

VIINSIGHT
INTO THIS.
I
WENT
TO

WE 
TALKED
TO
ME
HOW
SOMETIMES 
YOU'RE
ALWAYS
HUNGRY
BECAUSE 
THE
FOOD
AS
NO
NUTRIENTS
AND 
WE'RE
STARVING
FOR NUTRIENTS.
TFRS ASTOUNDING.
FOE
SLEEP,
CORN
SYRUP
WAS
ONE 
OF THEM.

ALL
OF
THE
THING
THAT
IS
TURN 
YOUR

AND 
MAKE
YOU
HUNGRY
BECAUSE 
NOTHING
IS
GETTING IN.

Sandra:
SO
YOU'RE
GETTING 
HYPNOTIZED,
AND
THAT'S
GOING 
TO
HELP

IT'S
GOING

AND
HE
CAME
ON,
AND
THAT
WAS 
MY
INTERN
TO KUSI.
>>
Sandra:
SUMMERIZE
OUR FACE.
>>
FIRST
IS
TAKING
CARE
OF 
YOUR SKIN.
YOU
CAN'T
HAVE
BEAUTIFUL
MAKE 
UP
UNLESS
YOUR
TAKING
CARE
OF 
YOUR SKIN.
HYDRATE, HYDRATE.
>>
AND
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHAT 
YOU'RE
MORE
VIKING
PROGRAM
S 
BUT
WE
PREP
WITH
A
OLAY 
MOISTURE
AND
SPF
OF
30
FOR
THE 
SUMMERTIME.
YOU
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
YOU'RE 
NOT
GETTING
PREMATURE
AGING
OR 
ANY
TYPE
OF
SUN SPOTS.
SO HYDRATE.
HYDRATE.
AND
YOU
WANT
TO
LIGHTEN
AND 
BRIGHTEN.
I
DON'T
KNOW
IF
YOU
USE
A 
PRIMER.
THIS
HAS
RUSSIAN LICORICE.
THIS
LIGHT
REFLECK
IS
GREAT
ON 
DAYS
YOU
DON'T
WANT
TO
WEAR 
MAKEUP
F.
YOU'RE
GOING
TO
THE 
DEL
MAR
FAIR
OR
WHATEVER, 
YOU'RE
GETTING
A
LIGHT 
REFLECTION
AND
IT
DISTRACTS 
FROM
THE
IMPERFECTIONS
ON
THE 
FACE.
>>
WE
PREPPED
HER
SKIN
WITH 
THE
PRIMEER
AND
FOLLOWED
WITH 
A
GOOD BASE.
WHAT
I
LIKE
THIS
ABOUT
BASE
IS 
IT'S
A
POWDER,
SO
WHEN
YOU 
APPLY
IT,
YOU
FEEL
HOW
IT 
DISAPPEARS.
>>
Sandra:
IT
JUST
GOES
INTO 
THE SKIN.
>>
AND
YOU
CAN
USE
IT
ANYWHERE 
YOU
NEED
COVERAGE,
IT'S
ONE
OF 
THOSE
FOUNDATIONS
YOU
DON'T 
HAVE
TO
USE
EVERYWHERE,
AND
IT 
BLENLDS IN.
IT
DRIES
TO
POWDER EASY.
AND
THE
IMPORTANT
THIRNG
IS 
NOT
TO
LOOK
OVER
MADE
UP
IN 
THE
SUMMER, RIGHT?
>>
LESS
IS MORE.
AND
WHAT
WE'RE
SEEING
ON
THE 
RED
CARPETS
NOW
IS
THE 
BEAUTIFUL
GOLD
AND
TANGERINES 
AND
BRONZERS,
THIS
IS 
FANTASTIC.
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
MY
FAVORITE 
PRODUCTS.
ITS
GOT
THROAN
COLORS
OF 
BRONZER,
AND
THE
WAY
I 
FORMULATED
IT
WAS
--
YOU
KNOW 
HOW
SOME
LOOK
MUDDY,
AND 
THAT'S
JUST
NOT
THE
LOOK
I
WAS 
GOING FOR.
I'M
FIGURE
TO
SHOW
HOW
TO
YOU 
GET
THE
MONOCHROMATIC LOOK.
USE
THE
BRONZER
AS
EYE
SHADOW, 
AND
WE'RE
USING
IT
ALL
OVER 
THE EYES.
WE'RE
DOING
A
COLOR
WASH 
VERSUS
WHERE
YOU'RE
PUTTING 
ONE
LIGHT
COLOR,
AND
THEN 
DARKER
AND DARKER.
SO
YOU
PUT
A
FULL
SWOON
OVER 
THE
EYE,
AND
THAT'S
GOING
TO 
GIVE
HER
A --
>>
Sandra:
BRONZEY LOOK.
>> EXACTLY.
>>
Sandra:
THAT'S PRETTY.
SOOTS MONOCHROMATIC.
IT'S
THE
BLURB
AND
THE EYES.
>>
ONE
THING
THAT
A
LOT
OF 
WOEM
DON'T
KNOW
TO
DO
WITH
THE 
BRONZER
IS
TO
TAKE
IT
DOWN
THE 
BRIDGE
OF
THE
NOSE,
AND
THE 
SKIN.
SO
THAT
CREATES
LIGHT REFLECK.
LESS
IS
MORE,
AND
KEEPING
IT 
MONOCHROMATIC.
BRONZER
ON
THE
NOSE
AND
THE 
TIP
OF
THE CHIN.
>>
Sandra:
AND
LIP COLOR?
>>
LIP
LINER
IS OBSOLETE.
>>
Sandra:
I'M
SO YESTERDAY.
>>
NEED
TO UPDATE.
>>
Sandra:
NO
LIP LINER.
>>
THIS
IS
DESERT
JEWEL
FOR 
THE SUMMERTIME.
BUT
IF
YOU
WANT
THE
FRAME
ON 
THE
LIP,
TAKE
A GLOSS.
IT'S
BEAUTIFUL
FOR
ALL
SKIN 
TONES.
OPEN
YOUR LIPS.
>>
Sandra:
BECAUSE
I
THINK
A 
LOT
OF
PEEP
NEED
THE
DEF 
ANYTHING.
>>
AND
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
ARE 
STUCK
IN
THE TREND.

Sandra:
YOUR
MAKEUP
LINE 
SOLD
OUT

Sandra:
THAT'S
A
GREAT 
IDEA.
YOU
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
TIME
WE 
SPEND
IN
THE

TAXIING
KIDS 
TO
CAMP

THAT'S
A
GREAT IDEA.

JUST
HAVE
IT
IN
THE
CAR

IT
WORKS WELL.

AND
JADEN
KNOWS
THOSE 
EXERCISES
LIKE THAT.
SHE'S
ON

OF IT.
WE'LL
SEE
YOU
NEXT
TUESDAY 
WITH

TOMORROW

Sandra:
WELL,
WE
ALL
KNOW 
SMOKING
DURING
PREGNANCY
CAN 
LEAD
TO
MAJOR
HEALTH PROBLEMS.
COMING
UP
NEXT
ON
INSIDE
SAN

THE
DISEASE
THAT
COULD 
BE
LINKED
TO
SMOKING
WHILE

A

WHAT'S
THE POINT.

THERE'S
ALSO
WHITE

Sandra:
A
NEW
STUDY
SHOWS 
HOW
DANGEROUS
WOMEN
WHO
SMOKE 
DURING PREGNANCY.
A
MUCH
HIGHER
RISK
OF
HAVING
A 
CHILD
WITH
SEVERE
TURRETS
OR 
COMPULSIVE DISORDER.

Renee:
I
CAN'T
BELIEVE 
WOMEN
WHO
ARE
PREGNANT
DO T.

MAYBE
EVEN
CUT
BACK
ON
THE 
CAFFEINE
A LITTLE.
I
NOTICED
SHE

YOU
PUT
SIX

I'M
NOT
SUGGESTING THAT.

Renee:
LET
ME
WRITE
THAT 
ONE DOWN.
>> NO.

IT
LEADS
TO
THE
ICE CREAM.
WHY, SANDRA?
>>
Sandra:
THAT'S
A
GOOD 
QUESTION.
APPARENTLY
IT'S
JUST
A 
NOVELTY.
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
SELL
THIS
SAY 
IT'S
NOT
GOING
TO
MAKE
PEOPLE 
HIGH,
BUT
THE
CRITICS
SAY
JUST 
THE
THOUGHT
OF
PUTTING
THE 
INGREDIENTS
IN
THE
TEA
FOR 
MARKETING
IS
SENDING
KIDS
THE 
WRONG MESSAGE.
IT'S
A
GIMMICK,
BUT
SMALL 
AMOUNTS
OF
THC
IS
A
POTENT 
INGRED CENT.

YOU'RE
LOOKING
FOR

CAN
YOU

THE
ICE TEA.
BEFORE
WE
MOVE
OWE
HAVE 
ENTERTAINMENT
NEWS
TO
SHARE, 
RIGHT?

Sandra:
WE
HAVE
A
FEEL
GOOD 
STORY
THIS MORNING.
WE'VE
ALL
HEARD
ABOUT
PEOPLE 
WITH
HEART
PROBLEMS,
BUT
WHAT 
ABOUT
MAN'S
BEST FRIEND.
ONE
LITTLE
YORKY
NAMED
ZACH
IS 
TRYING
OUT
THIS
LIFE
SAVING 
DEVICE.
SIX
WEEKS
AGO,
ZACH
HAD
SUCH
A 
SLOW
BEATING
HEART,
HE
WAS 
BARELY BREATHING.
HE
CAME
TO
SAN
DIEGO
WHERE
A 
VETERINARY
CARTIOLOGIST
GAVE 
HIM
A
PACEMAKER
THE
SIZE
OF
A 
SILVER DOLLAR.
IT
COSTS
3,000 BUCKS.
ZACH'S
OWNERS
SAY
THE
PAYBACK 
IS PRICELESS.
>>
Sandra:
YOU
HAVE
TO
LIKE 
THE DOG.
>>
$3,000
AND
THEN SOME.
>>
THEY'RE
PROBABLY RICH.
NO RICH.
THAT'S
A
LOT
OF
MONOA
LITTLE 
DOG.
>>
AND
SPEAKING
OF
DOGS,
IT 
MAIFSH
A
DOG
GONE
HEARD LIFE.
EDDIE
WASN'T
ONE
TO
COMPLAIN, 
THE
JACK
RUSSELL
TERRIER 
PLAYEDY
ON
FRASIER
PASSED
AWAY 
LAST THURSDAY.
HIS
REAL
LIFE
MAIN
WAS MOOSE.
>>
AND
JUST
SO
YOU
KNOW,
I 
HAVE
FRIENDS
ON
THE LOT.
HE
USED
TO
ATTACK
CATS
AND 
STUFF.
HE
WAS
A
DIFFICULT DOG.
>>
Renee:
PRIMA DONNA.
16
1/2
YEARS
OLD
WHEN
HE 
KICKED
THE BUCKET.
>>
HE
PLAYED
EDO
THE
SERIES 
FOR
10
YEARS,
AND
BESIDES 
FIGHTING
CATS
AND
BEING
A 
SCENE STEALIR.
HE
WAS
KNOWN
AS
THE
ONE
THAT 
EVERYONE
LOVED
AND
CAME 
TOGETHER
ON
THE SET.
>>
Sandra:
MAY
HE
REST
IN 
PEACE.
>>
Renee:
AND
THE
CATS
MAY
BE 
REJOICING.
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
NOT REJOICING.
NAOMI
CAMPBELL'S
P.R. TEAM.
HOLY COW.
SHE'S
BACK
IN
THE
SPOTLIGHT 
AGAIN,
ACCUSED
OF
BEING, 
NAUGHTY.
ANOTHER
ONE
OF
CAMPBELL'S 
MAIDS
SAY
THE
SUPER
MODEL
HIT 
HER.
THEY
FAILED
A
LAWSUIT 
YESTERDAY,
THE
MAID
DID,
AND 
CAMPBELL
IS
SCHEDULEED
TO 
APPEAR
IN
COURT
ON
CHARGES
OF 
ASSAULT.
HOW
DO
YOU
SPIN
THAT
IN
A 
>>
IT
WAS
A
JEWEL
ENCRUSTED
-- 
SHE
HIT
HER
WITH
A
CELL
PHONE, 
AND
HURT HER.
>>
SHE'S
ACCUSED
OF
HITTING 
THE
MAID,
LIKE
MONIQUE
SAID 
WITH
A
CELL
PHONE
ON
THE
BACK 
OF
THE
HEAD
BECAUSE
SHE 
COULDN'T
--
BECAUSE
THE
MAID 
COULDN'T
APPARENTLY
FIND
A 
PAIR
OF
JEANS
CAMPBELL WANTED.
>>
Sandra:
SHE'S
BEEN
IN 
TROUBLE BEFORE.
>>
Renee:
THIS
IS
ABOUT
THE 
THIRD TIME.

SINGER 
AXLEROSE
HAS
TAKEN
A
BITE
OUT 
OF

HE
AND
TOMMY
HILFIGER
GOT 
INTO IT.
WHEN
THE
DESIGNER
CAN
SLAP
YOU 
AROUND,
IT'S OVER.
>>
HE'S
LOSING ANOTHER.
HE
WAS
ARRESTED
AND
STOCKHOLM, 
SWEDEN
AFTER
ALLEGEDLY
BITING 
A
SECURITY GUARD.
>>
NOOSE SICK.
>>
Renee:
MY
THREE-YEAR-OLD 

NEPHEW
IS
STRUGGLING
WITH IT.
>>
HE
WAS
DRUNK
WHEN
IT
BROKE 
OUT.
NO
WORD
ON
WHAT
CAUSED
THE 
FIGHT
WITH
THE
SECURITY
GUARD, 
BUT
A
WITNESS
SAID
THE
GUARD 
TRIED
TO
GET
BETWEEN
WHEN
ROSE 
STARTED
ARGUING
WITH
A
WOMAN 
IN
A
HOTEL LOBBY.
MAYBE
A
PICK
UP
GONE WRONG.

IT'S
THE
HILFIGER THING.

THE
GUY
THAT
MADE
MY
SHIRT 
IS TOUGHER.

Renee:
AND
ANOTHER
MORE 
POSITIVE
SPIN
THIS MORNING.
GUESS
WHO
WANTS
TO
ADD
TO
THE 
FAMILY

Sandra:

Renee: NO.
SHARON STONE.
SHE'S
ADOPTING
HER

WHY

Renee:
WHEN
YOU

HOWARD 
STERN,
VIVID
IMAGES
POP
INTO 
MIND
FOR
ALL
OF US.
BUT
I'M
THINKING
BARBARA 
WALTERS
ISN'T
ONE
OF THEM.
WELL,
ANYWAY,
SHE'S
JOINING 
STERN
IN
SIGNING
WUP
SIRIUS 
RADIO.
SHE'S
NOT
CO-HOSTING
ANYTHING 
WITH
STERN,
BUT
THEY'RE
ON
THE 
SAME RADIO.
SIRIUS
WILL
AIR
A
WEEKLY
TWO 
HOUR

REPLACE
SOME

THE

WAS
A
LONG
TIME AGO.
THEY
HAD
IT
GOING ON.

Sandra:
SHE'S
ALMOST --

200, 300.
>>
Renee:
IN
HER
70s,
THAT
WE 
KNOW
OF,
ACCORDING
TO
HER 
PUBLICIST.
AND
THE
LAST
STORY,
HARRY 
POTTER
FANS
--
I
KNOW
SANDRA 
IS,
YOUR
KID
IS
AT LEAST.
BRACE
YOURSELF
FOR
SAD
NEWS, 
AND
IT
IS
GOOD
THAT
WE'RE 
SITTING DOWN.
LET
ME
GET
YOU
THE
TISSUE 
HERE.
THERE
ISN'T ANY.
SHE
SAYS
SHE
PLANS
TO
KILL
OFF 
TWOF
THE
CHARACTERS
IN
THE 
FINAL
CHAPTER
OF
THE
LAST 
INSTALLMENT
OF
THE SERIES.
NOW,
SHE
WON'T
SAY
WEATHER 
HARRY
POTTEDER
HIMSELF
IS 
GOING
TO
BE AXED.
BUT
SHE'S
BEEN
PLANING
THIS 
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
WROTE
THE 
FINAL
CHAPTER
OF
THE
BOOK 
YEARS AGO.
SO
IT'S
A
DONE DEAL.

IS
GOING 
TO
GET T.

Renee:
I
LIED,
I
LIED,
AND 
I LIED.
ONE MORE.
YOU
DON'T
WANT
TO
MISS
THE 
MONTEL
WILLIAMS SHOW.
SUSAN
LENNON
IS
CO-HOSTING, 
AND
THAT
IS
NOT
A
LIE
AT ALL.
LOOK
NOW
GORGEOUS
SHE IS.
SHE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
STATION'S 
COVERAGE
OF

HOMECOMINGS
WHICH
CUSE 
SECOMPLETELY
DEDICATED
TO 
COVERING.
THE
MOST
SPECIAL
PART
OF
THE 
SHOW
IS
WHEN
A
YOUNG
WIFE
GETS 
THE
SHOCK
OF
A LIFETIME.
MONTEL
HAS
FLOWN
IN
HER 
HUSBAND
FROM
THE
PERSIAN
GULF 
TO
SURPRISE
HER
TO
HOLD
HIS 
NEWBORN
BABY
BOY
FOR
THE
VERY 
FIRST TIME.
DON'T
MISS
THE
ENTIRE
SHOW, 
MONTEL
WILLIAMS
TODAY
AT
2:00 
RIGHT
HERE
ON KUSI.
>>
HE
WAS
HERE
ON
THE
EARLY 
MORNING
SHOW,
AND
HE
LOVES 
SUSAN,
THEY
BONLDED,
AND
HE 
INVITED
HER
TO
GO
ON
THE
SHOW, 
AND
SHE
SAID
SHE
HAD
THE
BEST 
TIME.
>>
I'VE
BEEN
ON
HIS
SHOW
FOUR 
TIMES.
SEXY
VERSUS
SLEAZY,
AND
ONE
OF 
THEM
WAS
REALLY
GOOD,
A 
PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR
WHO
SPYED 
ON
GUYS,
AND
I
WAS
AGAINST
IT, 
ENGAGED PEOPLE.
THEY
PAID
HIM
TO
GO
SPY
ON
MEN 
AND
BRING
THE
TAPES
BACK
TO 
THE GIRLS.
I
DON'T
THINK
THAT'S
A
GOOD 
IDEA.
I
THINK
THAT --
>>
Sandra:
DID
YOU
FIGHT
WITH 
EACH OTHER?
>>
OH, YEAH.
WE
DIDN'T
FIGHT
LIKE
THAT,
BUT 
IF
YOU'RE
HIRING
A
PRIVATE 
INVESTIGATOR,
YOU
LRTD
DON'T 
TRUST HIM.
TAKE
THE
RING
OFF
AND
WALK 
AWAY.
>>
Renee:
NO
DATING
QUIZ
FOR 
YOU.
>>
I
HAD
SOME
LINE
THAT
IS
HE 
SAID
ON
HIS
WALL
OF
SHAME,
HE 
REALLY
LIKED THEM.
>>
Sandra:
DON'T
MISS
WITH 
SUSAN LENNON.
GOOD
TO
SEE YOU.
HAVE
A
GREAT
VACATION
THE
REST 
OF
THE WEEK.
AND
YOU'RE
BACK
ON
THE
5th
ON 
YOUR
BIG
RADIO SHOW.
>>
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
START 
HANGING
OUT
WITH
TWO
NICE 
LADIES.
>>
Sandra:
OKAY,
COMING
UP 
NEXT,
DR.
RICHARD
FITZPATRICK 
IS
HERE
WITH
THE
LATEST
BIG 
THING
IN
SKIN CARE.
IT
GETS
RID
OF
UNUSED
PIGMENT 
OR
BROWN SPOTS.
>>
Sandra:
SO
YOU'RE
NOT 
BURNING
THE SKIN?
>>
IF
YOU
TREAT
WITH
A
HIGH 
ENERGY,
YOU'LL
CAUSE
THE 
ENERGY
IS
CRUST
AND
PEEL
WHICH 
TAKES
ABOUT
A
WEEK
FOR
IT
TO 
HEAL.
BUT
THERE'S
A
CHOICE
OF 
ENERGIES.
CAN
YOU
USE
LOW
ENERGIES
THAT 
DON'T
CAUSE
CRUST
ASKING 
PEELING,
AND
IN
THAT 
PARTICULAR
INSTANCE,
YOU
HAVE 
TO
DO
A
SERIES
OF
TREATMENTS 
DOING
THREE
OR
FOUR
TREATMENTS 
AT
THREE
