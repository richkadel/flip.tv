GOING TO TAKE ME TO JAIL.
AND I CRIED.
I WAS LIKE, PLEASE, MOMMY.
TELL DADDY NOT TO TAKE ME TO 
JAIL.
AND SHE HAD ME THINKING THAT I
WAS GOING TO GO.

YOU TO JAIL.
BUT DADDY IS.
BUT DID DAD TAKE YOU TO JAIL?
>> DAD DID NOT TAKE ME TO JAIL.

EXPERIENCE?
I FOUND HIM TO BE A SURPRISINGLY
NICE GUY.

HE'S VERY SWEET.
HE HAS A GREAT HEART.
HE'S SO MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT
PEOPLE THINK HE IS.
>> Jimmy: HIS HEART IS 
BULLET-PROOF.
WERE YOU NERVOUS WHEN U WERE 
AROUND HIM?
>> AT FIRST, I WAS.
I WAS WALKING ON SET.
AND I WAS THINKING, OH, MY GOD.
I'M GOING TO GET SHOT ON THE 
SET.
AND TYSON BECKFORD, HE FAKED A 
DRIVE-BY.
>> Jimmy: WHAT?
>> HE'S REALLY BIZARRE.
I SWEAR.
ME AND MY MOM BOTH GOT ON THE 
GROUND.

BUT THAT'S OKAY.
I TP'd HIS ENTIRE TRAILER INSIDE
AND OUT.
>> YOU GOT HIM BACK.
>> Jimmy: YEAH.
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
>> I WENT WITH TOILET PAPER.
>> WE DO THE SAME THING IN MY 
HOOD.
WHEN WE GET A DRIVE-BY, WE TD 
THE GUY THE NEXT DAY.
>> Jimmy: THAT MIGHT BE THE 
SINGLE STUPIDEST THING OF 
ANYBODY DOING.
>> THAT'S OKAY.
I'M FROM CANYON COUNTRY.
THAT'S THE BEST CAN I DO.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
YOU CAN TAKE HIM ON ONE OF THE 
ROLLER COASTERS.
>> Jimmy: GET HIM SICK ON THE 
REVOLUTION.

>>> AN HISTORIC BUILDING
PARTIALLY COLLAPSES WITH A
CROWD OF PEOPLE INSIDE
ATTENDING A DINNER.
>> THE TIMING COOPERATE BE
WORSE.
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY FORCED TO
CONSERVE WATER DURING A HEAT
WAVE.
>> AND THE CITY COUNCIL MAKES
A DECISION AFFECTING EVERY
GOLFER IN THE COUNTY.
>>> WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
BREAKING NEWS.
GOOD EVENING.
I'M CAROL LE BEAU.
>> AND I'M ELIZABETH SANCHEZ.
TONIGHT A 3-STORY ELKS CLUB
BUILDING PARTIAL SLEE --
PARTIALLY COLLAPSED IN
CLINTON, MISSOURI AS PEOPLE
GATHERED FOR DINNER.
AT LAST REPORT 9 PEOPLE WERE
STILL TRAPPED IN THE BUILDING.
ALL BUT ONE CALLED AUTHORITIES
ON THEIR CELL PHONES TO SAY
THEY WERE, FOR THE MOST PART,
THEY WERE OKAY.
IT IS MADE OF BREAK AND IS
ABOUT 100 YEARS OLD.
WE'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON ANY
DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING DURING
THIS NEWSCAST.
>>> OUR OTHER TOP STORY IS OUR
SIZZLING WEATHER.
MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTY
REACHED TRIPLE DIGITS.
LOREN JOINS US EARLY FROM THE
EMBARCADERO WITH A LOOK AT HOW
HOT IT GOT.
LOREN?
>> SURPRISINGLY, CAROL, THERE
WERE NO DAYTIME RECORDS FOR
HEAT BROKEN.
BUT THERE WERE OVERNIGHT LOW
TEMPERATURES.
HIGH LOW THAT'S WERE BROKEN.
BUT IT IS AMAZING HOW MANY
CITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY
TOPPED 100.
THE ONE THAT WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISING OF COURSE IS
BORREGO SPRINGS.
IT IS THAT TYPE OF YEAR.
BUT EL CAJON 104 AND AND
ALPINE 102 AND POWAY 102,
RAMONA 101, SANTEE 101,
FALLBROOK 101 AND LA MESA 101,
SPRING VALLEY, LEMON GROVE,
ESCONDIDO STILL NOT REPORTING,
BUT LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN OVER
100 AS WELL.
SO WITH ALL THIS HEAT WE HAVE
BEEN TELLING YOU LATELY THAT
SOME WATER DISTRICTS IN THE
NORTH COUNTY ARE CURTAILING
OUTDOOR WATER USE BECAUSE THEY
HAVE A BROKEN PIPE.
WELL NOW SOME MORE CITIES.
THIS TIME IT IS IN THE EAST
COUNTY ARE WITHOUT OUTDOOR
WATER.
WE'LL GET THE STORY FROM TENA.
>> IT IS NOT THE DESERT, BUT
AT TIMES IT LOOKS LIKE IT.
IT FEELS LIKE IT.
>> IT HAS BEEN HOT.
THAT'S WHY I WAITED SO LATE TO
DO IT.
>> IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BY
NOW, YOU SHOULDN'T UNTIL
THURSDAY.
>> THE LAWNS ARE DYING.
IT IS DRY.
THEY ASKED ME NOT TO USE THE
WATER SO WE'RE DEALING WITH
THAT.
>> FROM SANTEE TO ALPINE,
WHERE THE SO-CALLED DOG DAYS
OF SUMMER HAVEN'T EVEN REALLY
BEGUN, A COUNTY PLEA TO
CONSERVE WATER.
>> WE'RE ASKING CUSTOMERS TO
REDUCE THEIR WATER USE BY 50%
TOMORROW MORNING THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING.
>> NO WATERING LAWNS OR
WASHING CARS WITH THE GARDEN
HOSE.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE
WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO
USE THE WATER.
>> CONSTRUCTION BY THE CITY OF
SANTEE IS THE REASON WHY.
TO CONTINUE EXTENDING THE 52
FREEWAY, A PIPELINE THAT
SUPPLIES MORE THRAN HALF OF
THE COUNTY'S WATER SUPPLY MUST
BE CUT.
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE REPAIRS,
CONSTRUCTION CREWS ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO DIG A HOLE UNDER
THIS BRIDGE.
THAT'S WHERE THE WATER
PIPELINE IS.
IT IS ALSO GOING TO FORCE THEM
TO SHUTDOWN MISSION GORGE ROAD
TO ONE OR TWO LANES.
THE HEAT IS ALREADY FORCING
FAMILIES TO WALK WELL AFTER
SUNSET.
>> IT IS DEFINITELY NOT THE
BEST TIME TO TURN THE WATER
OFF, BUT WE'RE ON SOMEBODY
ELSE'S TIME FRAME HERE AND WE
WILL DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE
THIS 52 FREEWAY IS BUILT ON
TIME.
>> TIME IS WHAT RESIDENTS IN
THE EAST COUNTY WILL HAVE NOW.
UNDER THE HIGH SUN AND WATER
USE LOW.
WITH PHOTO JOURNALIST GAIR
FLINT, TENAEZZADINE, 10 NEWS.
>> WITH THE -- WHAT THE FOLKS
IN THE NORTH AND EAST COUNTY
NEED IS A RELIEF FROM THE HOT
WEATHER.
WILL THEY GET IT?
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT COMING
UP IN THE WEATHER SEGMENT.
I'M LOREN NANCARROW LIVE ALONG
THE EMBARCADERO.
CAROL?
>> THANKS, LOREN.
>>> NOW AN UPDATE ON A STORY
WE FIRST TOLD YOU ABOUT AT
6:30 THIS EVENING.
A 6-YEAR-OLD BOY FROM KOREA
HAS BEEN RUSHED TO CHILDREN'S
HOSPITAL AFTER BEING FOUND AT
THE BOTTOM OF A SWIMMING POOL.
IT HAPPENED AT THE MONARCH
APARTMENT COMPLEX AND SCRIPPS
RANCH.
WITNESSES PULLED THE BOY FROM
THE POOL AND POLICE PERFORMED
CPR WHILE WAITING FOR MEDICS
TO ARRIVE.
RESIDENTS HAVE SEEN AN
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF
CHILDREN AT THE COMPLEX AND
THE POOL.
>> THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
YOUNGER KIDS LIVING HERE
LATELY.
SO I'M OUT AND ABOUT AND I'M
ALWAYS KEEPING AN EYE AND
MAKING SURE THERE IS NOBODY AT
THE POOL.
IF THERE ARE NO ADULTS I PEEK
IN TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> NO WORD ON THE BOY'S
CONDITION.
>>> CREWS ARE STILL WORKING TO
REMOVE A PLANE THAT CRASH
CRASHED IN THE NORTH COUNTY.
IT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT WHEN
THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO TAKE
OFF FROM McCLELAND PALOMAR
AIRPORT.
THE PLANE STALLED MIDAIR AND
SLAM NEED TREES.
AMAZINGLY THE PILOT WAS ABLE
TO WALK AWAY FROM THE CRASH.
THE PLANE IS EXPECTED TO BE
REMOVED FROM THE TREE SOMETIME
TOMORROW MORNING.
>>> ANOTHER ODD ACCIDENT, THIS
ONE INVOLVING AN SUV IN
NATIONAL CITY.
IT HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON
NEAR 24th STREET.
THE CHP SAYS THE DRIVER WAS
GOING NORTHBOUND ON I-5 WHEN
FOR SOME REASON SHE DROVE OFF
THE ROAD AND THROUGH A FENCE
AND ON TO NEARBY TROLLEY
TRACKS.
THE ACCIDENT HELD UP A SINGLE
TROLLEY RUN FOR ABOUT 15
MINUTES.
THE WOMAN SUFFERED MINOR
INJURIES AND WAS TAKEN TO A
NEARBY HOSPITAL.
>>> IT IS SOON GOING TO COST
YOU MORE TO GOLF ON A SAN
DIEGO GOLF COURSE.
THAT INCLUDES TORY PINES.
TONIGHT THE CITY COUNCIL VOTED
TO RAISE GREEN FEES.
MICHAEL CHEN IS HERE TO SHOW
YOU HOW MUCH.
MICHAEL?
>> A RELAXING DAY ON THE
COURSE FOR A STEEPER PRICE?
WELL SOME ARE NOW TEEING OFF
ON THE PLAN OTHERS SAY HIGHER
PRICES ARE PAR FOR THE COURSE.
>> SHOULD IT TAKE MORE GREEN
TO GET ON THE GREEN IN SAN
DIEGO?
THE CITY COUNCIL THIS DAY
GRAPPLING WITH MAYOR SANDERS'
5-YEAR PLAN TO INCREASE FEES
ON CITY COURSES TO HELP PAY
FOR OPERATIONS AND
MAINTENANCE.
FOR CITY RESIDENTS HOPE FORGET
A WEEKEND TEE HIM -- TEE TIME,
GREENS FEES AT MISSION BAY AND
BALBOA PARK COURSES WOULD GO
FROM THE 20 TO 30 DOLLAR RANGE
BY 2011.
FOR TORY PINES COURSES AN
INCREASE TO 50 AND 79 DOLLARS.
VISITORS WOULD PAY ABOUT THREE
TIMES AS MUCH.
>> AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE
RAISED BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN
SO ECONOMICAL FOR YEARS.
>> WHILE SOME SAY CITY
RESIDENTS MAY HAVE BEEN
GETTING TOO GOOD A DEAL OVER
THE YEARS, OTHERS SAY THE IDEA
IS OUT OF BOUNDS.
>> IT PENALIZES THE RESIDENTS.
>> AMONG THE PROBLEM CITY
OFFICIALS ARE HOPING TO TAKE A
SWING AT, AN $800,000 BUDGET
SHORT FALL HERE AT BALBOA.
BUT SOME REGULARS FEAR THIS
PLAN WILL MAKE THINGS EVEN
WORSE.
>> BASICALLY WITH THE BLUE
COLLAR GOLF THAT GOES ON HERE,
THEY WILL PRICE PEOPLE OUT --
OFF THE GOLF COURSE.
>> WHAT'S NOT OFF BASE, SAY
SOME STAYINGENS, IS THE SECOND
PART OF THE MAYOR'S PROPOSAL
TORQUES RESERVE 70% OF ALL TEE
TIMES FOR CITY RESIDENTS.
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT
PLAY AND ARE HERE YEAR-ROUND
SUPPORT THE GOLF COURSES, THEY
SHOULD GET 70%.
>> A . THAT SCORES WITH THE
CITY COUNCIL.
IT IS BY A 7-1 VOTE THEY WOULD
APPROVE THE PLAN.
>> THE CITY SHOULDN'T
SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF A ROUND
OF GOLF FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN
AFFORD IT.
>> IT CUTS ME OUT.
IT LEAVES ME OUT.
I CAN'T AFFORD IT.
>> SEVERAL MENES AND WOMEN'S
GOLF GROUPS ARE UPSET.
THE PLAN WILL MEAN FEWER TEE
TIMES FOR THEM.
MEANWHILE, THE RISE IN GREENS
FEES WILL INCREASE GRADUALLY
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WITH
THE FIRST INCREASE AUGUST
1st.

BUT THAT'S ALONG THE WATER.
INLAND VALLEYS ARE STILL QUITE
WARM AND WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE
WARM WEATHER YET.
COMBY -- BY THE WAY, I TALKED
A LOT ABOUT THE UP WELLING WE
HAVE HAD.
THE WATER WENT FROM 72 AT THE
END OF LAST WEEK TO 62 OVER
THE WEEKEND.
AS THE WIND BLOWS ACROSS THE
SURFACE OF THE WATER IT TAKES
THE WARM WATER AND REPLACE
ITSELF WITH THE COOLER WATER
BELOW AND THEN THAT'S BLOWN
AWAY AND COOLER WATER STILL
COMES TO THE SURFACE.
IT IS LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT.
WELL, THE OTHER THING THAT
WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE IN THE
WEEKS AHEAD WILL BE AN ALGAE
BLOOM, SIMILAR TO MAYBE A RED
TIDE.
THE COOLER WATER COMING TO THE
SURFACE BRINGS A LOT OF
NUTRIENTS TO THE SURFACE ON
WHICH A RED TIDE CAN FEED.
72 DEGREES RIGHT NOW IN SAN
DIEGO.
THE DEW . AT 62.
THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY AT 71%.
TODAY WAS PATE 2.
74 WOULD BE TYPICAL FOR THIS
DATE.
5:43 IS THE RUN SIZE TOMORROW
AND IT SETS AGAIN AT 8:01.
THE SURF ACROSS SAN DIEGO
COUNTY IS ON THE FAIR SIDE.
OCEAN WATER TEMPERATURE IS 62
DEGREES.
THE BAYS ARE MUCH WARMER.
UP OVER 70 DEGREES STILL.
2-4 FOOT WAVES OUT OF THE
SOUTH AT 13.
LOOK AT THE ACTION STILL OUT
OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN.
THERE HAS BEEN PLENTY OF
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY OUT.
THERE THAT PROMPTED A SMALL
CRAFT ADVISORY.
WE ALSO HAVE A PLUME OF
MOISTURE IN THE LOWER RIGHT
HAND CORNER.
THUNDERSTORMS WILL MAKE THE
SAN DIEGO COUNTY DESERTS BY
ABOUT MIDNIGHT.
AND THEN MOVE INTO THE
MOUNTAINS.
SO DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU
HEAR SOME RUMBLES OF THUNDER
OVERNIGHT AND IT WOULDN'T BE
OUT OF THE QUESTION TO HAVE
SOME FAIRLY STRONG
THUNDERSTORMS OVER OUR LOCAL
MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT AS WELL.
AS THE WEEK GOES ON, THOSE
COULD SPILL OFF OF THE
MOUNTAINS INTO THE WESTERN
PART FROM THE -- PART OF THE
COUNTY.
LOOK AT THE EAST COAST.
THIS IS PHENOMENAL.
IT HAS BEEN RAINING FROM
FLORIDA TO MAINE FOR THE LAST
COUPLE DAYS.
THEY ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS
YET.
PICTURES LIKE THIS ARE
BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON.
MORE HEAVY RAIN TONIGHT AND
RESCUES IN SEVERAL PLACES.
THESE PICTURES HAPPEN TO BE
FROM BETHESDA, MARYLAND.
THERE WAS ALSO FLOODING IN
WASHINGTON, D.C., IN NEW
JERSEY, IN NEW YORK AND ALBANY
AND IN THE CAROLINAS AS WELL.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORMS
THAT SOME OF THE
CLIMATOLOGISTS SAY WILL COME
AS A RESULT OF GLOBAL WARMING.
76 ALONG THE COAST TOMORROW.
TROPICAL CLOUDS OVERALL OF THE
COUNTY.
90 DEGREES INLAND.
THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE WARM
TOO.
BUT THEY WILL BE A LITTLE
COOLER THAN IT HAS BEEN.
87 DEGREES.
109 FOR THE ANZO BORREGO
SPRINGS DESERT.
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE TUESDAY
AND WEDNESDAY WILL BE THE
COOLEST DAYS OF THE WEEK.
AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE END OF
THE WEEK AND THE WEEKEND, IT
WILL WARM UP AGAIN, BUT IT
SHOULD BE A LITTLE LESS HUMID.
SO THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE,
YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL IT AS MUCH
ONLY BECAUSE THE HUMID AIR
FEELS SO MUCH WARMER.
WE'RE DOWN ALONG THE
EMBARCADERO AND THE SAN DIEGO

>> Tyleen: Hi, I'm Tyleen
Megley.
And if you're looking for an
amazing way to make yourself
$1,000 checks, and $5,000
monthly bonus checks over and
over again, working part-time
right from home, don't change
the channel.
Because in just a few minutes
from right now, you're going to
wish you could have started
doing this ten years ago.
>> This is probably the easiest
money I've ever made.
I've made over $2,000 an hour.
That's more than a lot of
doctors make, or lawyers.
>> Tyleen: Why would you go to
work for someone else all day
long when you could be making
yourself a quiet fortune working
part-time right from home?
Our company pays out $5,000
bonus checks every month.
And the company has already paid
out millions of dollars.
So what are you waiting for?
Give us a call, and in less than
seven minutes from right now, my
bet is that you're going to wish
you could have done this ten
years ago.
The phone call is free.
So what are you waiting for?
>> So far I've made over $30,000
and with it, I've been able to
pay college, um, I've been able
to put away money for savings.
I've been able to go to the
store, go shopping.
I've been able to help out my
family.
Um...it's completely changed my
life.
>> Tyleen: It doesn't matter
what your education is.
It doesn't matter how old you
are.
If you're truly looking for an
amazing way to make money from
home, working part-time, you
have to give us a call right
now.
Every month, we pay out $5,000
bonus checks.
And now we made the entire
program 50 times more exciting
by giving you more ways to make
money.
People from all over the country
are making money.
And the company has already paid
out millions of dollars.
So don't wait one more second.
Pick up the phone and make tha
call right now.
>> This is most definitely the
easiest $5,000 I have ever made
in my entire life.
I would tell anybody watching
this show they have to do it. 
>> Tyleen: Millions of dollars
have already been paid out, and
that was before we made this
entire program 50 times more
exciting.
On top of all the
thousand-dollar checks you can
make, now you can make $500
checks from hundreds of other
people all over the country.
But even before we made this
program 50 times more exciting,
we had people from all over the
country making themselves a
quiet fortune doing this.
Take a look.
>> At first, my wife thought it
was just another little thing
that I had got into.
But until she started pulling
the checks out of the mailbox--
I mean, the checks kept coming
and coming and coming.
>> I've made $18,000.
Hello, $18,000 in three months.
12 hours a month.
And with that money, I am--I'm
living the life I am supposed to
live.
I'm--I've bought a house.
I've paid off some credit card
debt.
All my personal loans.
Taking classes.
I get my hair done, I get shoes.
I go to dinner.
>> Tyleen: Imagine being able to
go on different vacations all
year long and start living the
life you've always dreamed of.
Well, why not?
People all over the country are
making money every year with
this program.
So why not you?
The best part of this entire
program is that you never even
risk your $35 setup fee.
Because we let you try this for
60 days, 100% risk-free.
Pick up the phone and give us a
call.
And we will explain the entire
program in less than seven
minutes.
>> I've been recommending this
product for less than two
months.
In the past, um, you know, six
to seven weeks, my income is--is
in the neighborhood of about
$7,500.
And that is really, really
feeling pretty good.
>> Tyleen: If you're a single
mom, or if you're someone who is
retired and looking for a great
way to make extra $1,000 checks,
or if you're tired of always
just getting by and always being
in debt, if you hate your job or
even if you love your job, but
you just need to make more
money, when you hear how easy it
is to make money with this
program, my bet is that if you
give us a call right now, in
less than seven minutes, you're
going to want to do this.
If you don't absolutely love
your job, or if you're not
making enough money, pick up the
phone.
And let us explain exactly what
this amazing program is all
about.
>> A business like this can be
not only done anywhere in the
country, but it can be done
anywhere in the world.
And that's the beauty of the
Internet.
It's--it's just like this income
opportunity.
There is no limits.
And we haven't even seen the
best days yet.
>> Tyleen: If you love your job
and you're making enough money,
then congratulations.
Because you've already made it.
But if you don't love your job,
and you're not making enough
money, you have to give us a
call right now.
Imagine working from home,
setting your own hours, being
your own boss, and having the
potential to make ten times more
than what you're currently
making.
Well, you're one phone call away
from what could be the most
amazing thing you have ever
done.
Millions are being paid out.
So why not give this incredible
program a try?
Call us right now, and in less
than seven minutes, my bet is
that you're going to want to get
started right away.
You have nothing to lose, and
the phone call is free.
And this could change your
entire life.
So call right now.
>> I've spent less than 20 hours
doing this, and I've already
made $6,000.
I can't even believe it.
>> It's--it's--it's an amazing
bomb.
[chuckles]
It's an amazing--it's an
explosion.
When you put these two
combinations together.
The greatest product and the
greatest income opportunity
together.
>> Tyleen: Even if you're
someone who is already making
great income, how great would it
be if you had another way that
you could start making $1,000
checks over and over again?
Or what if you could make $500
checks from hundreds of other
people all over the country?
We paid out millions prior to
making this program 50 times
better.
Give us a call, and when you
hear what we did that allows you
to make $500 checks over and
over again, from other people
all over the United States, at
the same time you're generating
yourself $1,000 checks, you're
going to wish you could have
started doing this ten years
ago.
>> I've spent hours and hours
doing other programs and made,
like, less than $100 off of
them.
This one, $10,000 for ten hours
of work.
>> Tyleen: People from all over
the country and all walks of
life have already started doing
this.
And now we have people who have
made themselves a fortune doing
this just part-time.
You can do this any time you
want to.
It's your business.
We pay you $1,000 checks over
and over again.
Plus, every month, you have a
chance to earn a $5,000 monthly
bonus check.
And the best part is, is that
you can try this for 60 days,
100% risk-free.
And see for yourself just how
fantastic this really is.
Pick up the phone and give us a
call right now.
In less than seven minutes, we
can explain the entire program
from A to Z.
And in just a few minutes, we
can have you completely set up
and ready to go.
Don't let another day pass you
by.
>> The checks come in the mail,
and believe you me, they come,
and many times there are more
than just one.
>> Tyleen: Okay, here's the bet.
Call the number and see for
yourself just how incredible
this program really is.
My bet is that in less than
seven minutes, you'll want to
start doing this.
The company has already paid out
millions of dollars, and the
program keeps getting better.
The company pays $5,000 monthly
bonus checks, and you can do
this program part-time right
from home.
And now you can make $500
checks over and over again
from hundreds of other people.
And in less than seven minutes,
we can explain the entire
program from A to Z.
Pick up the phone and get ready
to start living the life you
deserve.
>> You know, it really feels
phenomenal to be able to have
such great response to people
wanting to try the product and
then be compensated so royally
for it.
I mean, in the first few weeks,
I've made over $7,500, and
that's just, uh, beyond what my
wildest dreams ever were when I
started.
It is absolutely the easiest
money I've ever made in my
entire life.
>> Tyleen: If you're not already
making a fortune, you owe it to
yourself to try this phenomenal
program.
Imagine getting paid $1,000
checks over and over again.
And how excited would you be to
start making $500 checks over
and over again from different
people all over the country?
How many more years are you
gonna let life just pass you by
before you say it's time to do
something that gives me a chance
to start making the money that
I've always dreamed of?
Pick up the phone and give
yourself that chance right now.
>> I've never been in the
business, m-my wife has seen the
light.
As a matter of fact, when I
landed in Phoenix, she called me
on my cell phone and said,
"You got checks in the mail."
And, uh, this--this program
works.
>> Tyleen: There are a lot of
ways to make money, but this
program allows you to try the
entire program 100% risk-free
for the next 60 days.
So you can see for yourself just
how terrific this program really
is.
Imagine making $1,000 checks,
$500 checks from people all over
the country, and having the
chance to make a $5,000 bonus
check every month.
Millions of dollars have already
been paid out.
So pick up the phone and let us
explain the entire program in
just a few minutes.
The money you could make is just
insane.
So pick up the phone and call us
right now.
>> So far I've made over
$30,000.
Um, my best month I made over
$10,000, and it was a really
good feeling to make that much
in just one month.
Um, and I did it, just basically
just sending people to my
website.
I didn't do anything else.
>> Tyleen: Maybe you've been
watching this show for a few
minutes and you still haven't
called.
Well, all the people you've seen
on this show were just like you.
They were sitting there watching
our show, deciding whether or
not they wanted to give this a
try.
The only difference is that they
picked up the phone and they
made the call, and they got
started.
If you don't give this a chance,
you'll never know.
And the great part is, is that
you get to try this program,
amazing program, 100% risk-free
for the next 60 days.
Why not pick up the phone?
And in just seven minutes or
less, we can explain the entire
program to you from A to Z.
>> Just the other day I-I wasn't
expecting a check.
Holidays were here, and I was
busy, and I just had no time to
do anything, or even check the
website, and the check came in
the mail.
And I'm looking at my wife,
"What is this?"
And she's like, "Another check
came."
So it's just, it's just crazy.
>> Tyleen: After paying out
millions of dollars with our
original program, we made the
program 50 times better by
adding new ways you can generate
$500 checks from different
people all over the country.
How different would your life be
if you started making $1,000
checks over and over again?
And how excited would you be if
you started getting $500 checks
from different people all over
the country?
Well, it's possible.
But you have to make that first
step by picking up the phone and
making that call.
Different people from all over
the country are making money
with this program.
So why not you?
Pick up the phone and make that
call right now.
>> Well, I was laid up,
and--and the money was stopping,
it had stopped coming in, and,
uh, and I needed money
desperately to help my son, and,
uh, this was a godsend.
I made $15,000 that all went
directly to my son.
And, uh, without it, he would've
had to drop out of college.
He had just started.
Got a computer for him, got to
pay this first year of school
for him, and, uh, you know, it
saved him for staying in school.
So, it was a real, uh, real
blessing to have this happen to
me.
>> Tyleen: How different would
you and your family's life be if
you were able to make just one
extra check every month?
Well, what if you started making
more money doing this than
anything you've ever done?
Well, it's possible.
And you can get started right
away.
Pick up the phone and in less
than seven minutes we will
explain the entire program and
my bet is that you're gonna wish
you started doing this ten years
ago.
Pick up the phone and make that
call right now.
>> I really couldn't compare
this to a 9:00 to 5:00 job
because you have to sit there on
a 9:00 to 5:00 job all day and
make $8, $10, $20 an hour.
Where as I can make $100 an hour
and don't have to be on a 9:00
to 5:00 job.
So there's no comparison to this
'cause I average $100 an hour,
and I don't have to sit there
and listen to my boss.
All I do, I get up out of my
bed, pass out some cards, I go
to my mailbox, pull out a check,
it's a phenomenal business
opportunity.
>> Tyleen: Out of all the ways
you've ever tried to make money,
have you ever tried a program
that gave you the chance to make
$1,000 checks, $500 checks, and
$5,000 bonus checks over and
over again?
Millions of dollars have already
been paid out with millions more
scheduled to be paid out.
So why not get your share?
Call us right now, and in just a
few minutes, we can explain the
entire program, and get you set
up right away.
The call is free, and it could
change your entire life.
So don't wait another second.
Pick up the phone and make that
call right now.
>> I've spent more time getting
the checks and taking them to
the bank than I have, uh, just
about setting it up and actually
promoting it.
>> Tyleen: Why would you go to
work for someone else all day
long when you could be making
yourself a quiet fortune working
part-time, right from home?
Our company pays out $5,000
bonus checks every month, and
the company has already paid out
millions of dollars.
So what are you waiting for?
Give us a call, and in less than
seven minutes from right now, my
bet is that you're gonna wish
you could've done this ten years
ago.
The phone call is free.
So what are you waiting for?
>> Seeing all the testimonials
on TV, it just got me excited.
I was like, "Wow, those people
just making so much money."
So I just decided to join
myself and I'm really glad I did
because after I joined I've been
making so much money.
I've made over $30,000 so far,
and checks are coming in every
week.
>> Tyleen: Hi, I'm Tyleen
Megley, and if you're looking
for an amazing way to make
yourself $1,000 checks and
$5,000 monthly bonus checks,
over and over again, working
part-time right from home,
don't change the channel.
Because in just a few minutes
from right now, you're going to
wish you could've started doing
this ten years ago.
>> At first my wife thought it
was just another little thing
that I had got into.
But until she started pulling
the checks out of the mailbox.
I mean the checks kept coming
and coming and coming.
>> Tyleen: If you're a single
mom or if you're someone who is
retired and looking for a great
way to make extra $1,000 checks,
or if you're tired of always
just getting by and always being
in debt, if you hate your job or
even if you love your job, but
you just need to make more
money, when you hear how easy
it is to make money with this
program, my bet is that if you
give us a call right now, in
less than seven minutes you're
going to want to do this.
If you don't absolutely love
your job or if you're not making
enough money, pick up the phone
and let us explain exactly what
this amazing program is all
about.
>> A business like this can be
not only be done anywhere in the
country, but it can be done

dollars.
So don't wait one more second.
Pick up the phone and make that

>> As a matter of fact, my
mailman has began to tease me.
I know, sometimes when I have
checks, he'll walk by and say "I
have nothing for you."
I say "Okay, bring it to me,
bring it to me...I know you have
a check for me."
>> Imagine being able to go on
different vacations all year
long and start living the life
you've always dreamed of.
Well, why not?
People all over the country are
making money every year with
this program.
So why not you?
The best part of this entire
program is that you never even
risk your $35 setup fee because
we let you try this for 60 days,
a hundred percent risk free.
Pick up the phone and give us a
call and we will explain the
entire program in less than
seven minutes.
>> I make $6,000 a month.
I spend 12 hours doing it.
And it's the easiest thing I've
ever done.
With this money, I'm living the
life I'm supposed to live.
I am living it right now.

>> The checks come in the mail.
And believe you me they come.
And many times there are more
than just one.
>> Tyleen: Even if you're
someone who is already making
great income, how great would it
be if you had another way that
you could start making $1,000
checks over and over again?
Or what if you could make $500
checks from hundreds of other
people all over the country?
We paid out millions prior to
making this program 50 times
better.
Give us a call and when you hear
what we did that allows you to
make $500 checks over and over
again from other people all over
the United States at the same
time you're generating yourself
$1,000 checks, you're going to
wish you could've started doing
this ten years ago.
>> So far I've made over $30,000
and with it I've been able to
pay college.
I've been able to put away money
for savings.
I've been able to go to the
store and go shopping.
I've been able to help out my
family.
It's completely changed my life.
>> Tyleen: Okay, here's the bet.
Call the number and see for
yourself just how incredible
this program really is.
My bet is that in less than

The company has already paid out
millions of dollars and the

The company pays $5,000 monthly
bonus checks.
And you can do this program part
time, right from home.
And now you can make $500 checks
over and over again from
hundreds of other people.
And in less than seven minutes
we can explain the entire
program from A to Z.
Pick up the phone and get ready

>> As a matter of fact, I took
the first check and framed it
which was a thousand dollar
check.
And that was for the 20
individuals that tried the
product.
And it's so simple.
So if you're thinking about an
opportunity, this is it.
>> Tyleen: If you're not already
making a fortune, you owe it to
yourself to try this phenomenal
program.
Imagine getting paid thousand
dollar checks over and over
again.
And how excited would you be to
start making $500 checks over
and over again from different
people all over the country?
How many more years are you
going to let life just pass you
by before you say, "It's time to
do something that gives me a
chance to start making the money
that I've always dreamed of"?
Pick up the phone and give
yourself that chance right now.
>> I've spent hours and hours
doing other programs and made
less than a hundred dollars of
off them.
This one?
$10,000 for ten hours of work.
>> Tyleen: There are a lot of
ways to make money.
But this program allows you to
try the entire program 100
percent risk free for the next
60 days so you can see for

attracted the people in my life
that I want.
I am living the life I'm
supposed to live.
And I will continue to do this
for the rest of my life if I'm
so lucky.
>> Tyleen: Maybe you've been
watching this show for a few
minutes and you still haven't
called.
Well, all the people you've seen
on this show were just like you.
They were sitting there watching
our show, deciding whether or
not they wanted to give this
a try.
The only difference is, is that
they picked up the phone and
they made the call.
And they got started.
If you don't give this a chance,
you'll never know.
And the great part is,
is that you get to try this
program--amazing program--
100% risk free for the next 60
days.
Why not pick up the phone?
And in just seven minutes or
less, we can explain the entire
program to you from A to Z.
>> This is probably the easiest
money I've ever made.
I've made over $2,000 an hour.
That's more than a lot of
doctors make, or lawyers.
>> Tyleen: After paying out
millions of dollars with our
original program, we made the
program 50 times better by
adding new ways you could
generate $500 checks from
different people all over
the country.
How different would your life be

this to a 9:00 to 5:00 job
because you have to sit there on

gonna wish you started doing
this ten years ago.
Pick up the phone and make that
call right now.
>> This is most definitely the
easiest $5,000 I have ever made
in my entire life.
I would tell anybody watching
this show they have to do it.
>> Tyleen: Why would you go to
work for someone else all day
long when you could be making
yourself a quiet fortune
working part time right from
home?
Our company pays out $5,000
bonus checks every month.
And the company has already paid

So what are you waiting for?
Give us a call and in less than
seven minutes from right now,
my bet is that you're gonna wish
you could have done this
ten years ago.
The phone call is free,
so what are you waiting for?
>> Just the other day, I wasn't
expecting a check.
The holidays were here and I was
busy.
And I just had no time to
do anything or even check the
website.
And the check came in the mail.
And I'm looking at my wife,
"What is this?"
She's like, "Another check
came."
It's just...just crazy.
>> Tyleen: Millions of dollars
have already been paid out.
And that was before we made this
entire program 50 times more
exciting.
On top of all the $1,000 checks
you can make, now you can make
$500 checks from hundreds of
other people all over the
country.
But even before we made this
program 50 times more exciting,
we had people from all over the
country making themselves
a quiet fortune doing this.
>> I've spent less than 20 hours
doing this and I've already make
$6,000.
I can't even believe it.
>> Tyleen: If you're a single
mom or if you're someone who's
retired and looking for a great
way to make extra $1,000 checks,
or if you're tired of always
just getting by and always being
in debt...
If you hate your job or even if
you love your job, but you just
need to make more money...
When you hear how easy it is to
make money with this program,
my bet is that if you give us a
call right now, in less than
seven minutes you're gonna wanna
do this.
If you don't absolutely love
your job, or if you're not
making enough money, pick up the
phone and let us explain
exactly what this amazing
program is all about.
>> I've never been in a
business--my wife has seen the
light.
As a matter of fact, when I
landed in Phoenix, she called me
on my cell phone and said,
"You got checks in the mail."
And, uh, this program works.
>> Tyleen: The show is almost
over, so make sure you write
down the number or give us a
call right now.
Just think, in a few days from
today, you could start
generating an unlimited number
of $1,000 checks over and over
again.
Millions of dollars have already
been paid out.
This could be the most amazing
part-time income you have ever
made.
And if you're looking to totally
replace the income you currently
make, this could be the most
exciting thing you've ever done.
People from all over the country
have already done this.
So pick up the phone right now.
Because that one call could
change your life forever.
>> I've been recommending this
product for less than two
months.
In the past six to seven weeks
my income is in the neighborhood
of about $7,500.
And that is really, really
feeling pretty good.
>> Seeing all the testimonials
on TV, it just got me excited.
I was like, "Wow, those people
are just making so much money."
So I just decided to join
myself.
And I'm really glad I did
because after I joined
I've been making so much money.
I've made over $30,000 so far
and checks are coming in every
week.
>> Tyleen: Okay, this is your
very last chance to pick up the
phone and get started with this
incredible program.
Think about this.
You get to try the entire
program 100% risk free
for 60 days.
We've already paid out millions
of dollars.
And you can start generating
$1,000 checks over and over
again starting in just a few
days from today.
And now we made the program 50
times more exciting by giving
you a chance to make $500 checks
over and over again from
different people all over the
country.
Pick up the phone and make that
call right now.
Or write down the number and
call the second you can.
It's time to start living the
life you and your family

So pick up the phone and make

DON'T LET THIS BE ANOTHER
YEAR THAT JUST SLIPS AWAY.
ATTEMPT GREAT THINGS FOR GOD.

THINGS FROM GOD.
WILL YOU DO THAT?
I URGE YOU TO DO IT TODAY.
ALL THAT AND MORE, THIS WEEK
ON THE CORAL RIDGE HOUR.
HI. I'M TAMMY FAYE.
WELCOME TO A VERY IMPORTANT
HALF HOUR OF YOUR LIFE.
BECAUSE THIS SHOW IS ABOUT
YOUR HEALTH AND WELLNESS.
MY GUEST IS KEVIN TRUDEAU,
AND HE'S THE AUTHOR OF
A BLOCKBUSTER BEST-SELLING BOOK,
"NATURAL CURES THAT THEY
DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT."
KEVIN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S A PLEASURE.
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU,
TAMMY FAYE.
NOW, KEVIN,
WHO ARE THE ELUSIVE "THEY"?
THE BOOK, "NATURAL CURES
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT,"
WHAT IT TALKS ABOUT IS THE FACT
THAT THERE ARE, IN FACT,
NATURAL NON-DRUG
AND NON-SURGICAL WAYS
TO PREVENT AND CURE
VIRTUALLY EVERY DISEASE.
AND THERE ARE
A GROUP OF COMPANIES,
PRIMARILY THE PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES, THE DRUG COMPANIES,
AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT,
THE FDA AND THE FTC,
THAT DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
THAT THERE ARE NATURAL
NON-DRUG AND NON-SURGICAL CURES
FOR VIRTUALLY ALL DISEASES.
AND THE REASON, TAMMY FAYE,
THAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW
IS BECAUSE IT WILL COST
THE DRUG COMPANIES MONEY.
YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY
ON NATURAL REMEDIES.
YOU CAN ONLY MAKE MONEY
ON PATENTED DRUGS,
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS CURE IS--
THAT'S WHAT THIS BOOK
IS ABOUT TO DO,
IS EXPOSING THE NATURAL CURES
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T BEING TOLD
THAT ACTUALLY DO EXIST.
NOW, KEVIN,
YOU LOOK VERY YOUNG TO ME.
YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A GRANDMOTHER OR A MOTHER
OR SOMEONE WHO GOT YOU
THINKING ABOUT NATURAL CURES.
WHAT IN THE WORLD
WOULD GET A YOUNG MAN
THINKING ABOUT NATURAL CURES?
ACTUALLY, IN THE BOOK
I DO TELL THE STORY
HOW I HAD SOME
MAJOR MEDICAL PROBLEMS
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG,
I WAS BORN WITH
A DEFORMED HEART,
A MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE,
AND THE STANDARD MEDICAL
COMMUNITY DIDN'T HAVE
THE ANSWER TO THAT PROBLEM.
I HAD TO SEEK OUT
NATURAL ALTERNATIVES.
AND THE FUNNY THING
THAT I FOUND IS,
THERE WAS A NATURAL CURE
FOR MY MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE,
BUT IT WASN'T ALLOWED
IN AMERICA.
THE FDA HAS MADE THAT ILLEGAL
TO BE USED IN AMERICA.
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL,
BUT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE CURE.
SHAME!
AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW.
THE FDA, THE FOOD
AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION
IN THIS COUNTRY,
PASSES THEIR OWN REGULATIONS,
WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL,
AND THE REGULATION
THAT THE FDA PASSED SAYS,
ONLY A DRUG CAN CURE,
PREVENT OR TREAT A DISEASE.
ONLY A DRUG CAN CURE,
PREVENT OR TREAT A DISEASE.
NOW, THAT IS
ABSOLUTELY INSANE.
THE FDA IS NOT TRYING
TO GET PEOPLE WELL.
THEY'RE NOT TRYING
TO CURE PEOPLE OF DISEASE.
THE FDA IS PROTECTING THE
PROFITS OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.
A DRUG IS NOT THE ONLY THING
THAT CAN CURE, PREVENT
OR TREAT A DISEASE,
BUT IT'S THE LAW IN AMERICA.
NOW, YOU'VE HEARD
OF THE DISEASE SCURVY.
SCURVY IS
A NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCY,
IT'S A VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY.
THE CURE FOR SCURVY IS WHAT?
EAT AN ORANGE.
ORANGES!
EXACTLY.
NOW, IF I WENT ON TELEVISION
AND I LOOKED AT THE CAMERA
AND I SAID.
"I HAVE AN ORANGE HERE,
AND THIS IS THE CURE
FOR THE DISEASE OF SCURVY,"
GUESS WHAT?
I WOULD GO TO JAIL.
THEY'D SLAP YOU RIGHT DOWN.
I WOULD GO TO JAIL, 
BECAUSE I WOULD BE SELLING
A "DRUG"--
BUT I BETCHA
THEY'D GO EAT THE ORANGE!
THEY'D EAT THE ORANGE.
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
THE DRUG COMPANIES DO NOT WANT
TO CURE OR PREVENT DISEASE.
THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE
PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS,
AND ALL THEY WANT TO DO
IS SELL MORE DRUGS.
WELL,
IT'S PROFITABLE FOR EVERYONE.
BECAUSE IT'S PROFITABLE
FOR THE DRUG COMPANY,
IT'S PROFITABLE
FOR THE RESEARCHERS,
IT'S PROFITABLE
FOR THE DOCTORS.
CORRECT.
THE ONLY ONE
IT'S NOT PROFITABLE FOR
IS US THE PATIENTS.
NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE FACT THAT
MORE AND MORE THINGS
ARE BEING CALLED DISEASES--
YEARS AGO WE HAD HEARTBURN,
NOW IT'S CALLED
ACID REFLUX DISEASE.
YEARS AGO
PEOPLE USED TO BE SHY.
NOW IT'S
SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER--
A DISEASE.
IT'S NOT A DISEASE.
BUT THE REASON
THEY'RE BEING CALLED DISEASES
IS BECAUSE,
ACCORDING TO THE FDA,
ONCE SOMETHING
IS LABELED A DISEASE,
ONLY A DRUG CAN THEN CURE,
PREVENT OR TREAT IT.
AND THAT'S HOW THEY GET RID
OF NATURAL REMEDIES.
DID YOU KNOW,
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IS BEING PUT INTO "RESEARCH"
TO CURE DISEASE--
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
MONEY IS NOT
BEING PUT INTO RESEARCH
TO CURE DISEASE.
WHEN PEOPLE GIVE MONEY
TO FOUNDATIONS AND CHARITIES,
THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING USED
TO CURE DISEASE.
IT'S NOT BEING USED
TO FIND A CURE.
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.
IT'S BEING USED TO FIND
A PATENTABLE DRUG
THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES CAN THEN SELL.
JUST READ
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.
READ INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY.
LISTEN TO THE REPORTS
ON TELEVISION.
PUBLICLY TRADED DRUG COMPANIES
HAVE A LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO INCREASE PROFITS
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.
IF A DRUG COMPANY'S GOAL
WAS TO CURE AND PREVENT DISEASE,
THEY'D ALL BE OUT OF BUSINESS.
OH, I BELIEVE THEY WOULD,
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
A LOT OF DISEASES
WOULD BE CURED RIGHT NOW,
IF THAT WERE THEIR GOAL.
THERE ARE CURES.
AND THAT'S THE THING.
IF A PERSON HAS
ACID REFLUX DISEASE,
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE.
IF THEY HAVE HEART DISEASE,
THEY DON'T NEED BYPASS SURGERY--
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE.
DIABETES--
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE.
MATTER OF FACT,
DIABETES IS ONE EXAMPLE.
THERE WAS A RESEARCHER
IN CANADA.
AN HERBAL COMBINATION
WAS RESEARCHED
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY
FOR OVER 25 YEARS.
IT WAS SHOWN BY
THE ASIAN DIABETIC ASSOCIATION
TO BE THE FINAL CURE
FOR DIABETES.
IT'S JUST
A COMBINATION OF HERBS--
VIRTUALLY ERADICATES
AND CURES DIABETES
IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
IN MOST CASES--
NOT ALL, BUT MOST CASES.
THE RESEARCHER
WAS OFFERED $30 MILLION CASH
TO TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET.
BECAUSE IT WOULD COST
THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES
TOO MUCH MONEY.
THE FDA IS TRYING TO BLOCK IT
FROM COMING INTO AMERICA
BECAUSE IT'LL HURT THE PROFITS
OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.
THERE'S A CURE FOR HERPES.
WE HEAR ON TELEVISION
THESE ADS THAT SAY,
"THERE IS NO CURE FOR HERPES,
TAKE OUR DRUG EVERY DAY
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE."
IT'S A COMPLETE FRAUD,
IT'S A COMPLETE LIE.
THERE'S LAWSUITS
GOING ON RIGHT NOW
AGAINST THE MANUFACTURER
FOR MANY OF THESE "HERPES DRUGS"
SHOWING THAT THEY DO NOT WORK
AS THEY'RE BEING PROMOTED.
THERE IS A NATURAL CURE.
IN MY BOOK, NOW,
"NATURAL CURE,"
I GIVE 50 SPECIFIC DISEASES
AND I TELL PEOPLE NOW
WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE
THE NATURAL CURES
OR THE WAYS TO PREVENT--
LET'S NAME SOME OF THESE.
CANCER, DIABETES,
HEART DISEASE, DEPRESSION.
YOU'VE MADE SOME REAL
STATEMENTS HERE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION.
PROZAC AND ALL
THE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF DEPRESSION TYPE OF DRUGS
BEING SOLD OUT THERE
I BELIEVE ARE ONE OF
THE GREATEST CRIMES
AGAINST HUMANITY,
IN MY OPINION.
YEAH, I THINK SO, TOO.
JUST RECENTLY
THIS KID UP IN MINNESOTA
TOOK A COUPLE OF GUNS,
KILLED ALL THESE PEOPLE?
IT WAS REPORTED THAT
HE WAS ON PROZAC,
STARTED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.
VIRTUALLY EVERY VIOLENT CRIME
COMMITTED BY A CHILD IN SCHOOL
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, WHERE
THEY GO IN AND KILL PEOPLE,
ALMOST ALL OF THOSE KIDS
WERE ON SOME TYPE OF
PSYCHIATRIC PRESCRIBED DRUG,
PRIMARILY FOR DEPRESSION
AND THINGS.
I THINK THAT IS A SIN
TO PUT YOUR CHILD ON
THINGS LIKE THAT.
THE DRUGS, IN MY OPINION,
ARE CAUSING A LOT OF
THE PROBLEMS.
NOW, THERE IS A NATURAL CURE
FOR DEPRESSION.
THERE'S A NATURAL
NON-DRUG AND NON-SURGICAL CURE
FOR DEPRESSION
WHICH RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN
CURES DEPRESSION--
GET THIS--CURES DEPRESSION,
95% OF THE CASES,
IN TWO TO THREE DAYS.
CURES.
THE DEPRESSION GOES AWAY.
IT'S A NATURAL,
NON-DRUG, NON-SURGICAL CURE.
I TELL IT IN THE BOOK.
ADDICTIONS--PEOPLE ARE
ADDICTED TO SMOKING,
CIGARETTES,
SOME PEOPLE ARE
ADDICTED TO CHOCOLATE--
ME!
I GOTTA READ THE BOOK!
WHERE'S THE BOOK?!
WHERE'D IT GO?!
THERE'S ACTUALLY A NATURAL WAY
TO REDUCE OR
ELIMINATE ADDICTIONS
AND STOP
THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGES.
FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS WITH
A PARTICULAR DOCTOR
THAT WAS BEING
INTERVIEWED ON CNN.
AND THE INTERVIEWER
WAS A CHOCOHOLIC,
AND DURING THE BREAK
THE INTERVIEWER SAID,
"YOU KNOW, DOCTOR,
I'M ADDICTED TO CHOCOLATE,
"I CARRY IT WITH ME
ALL THE TIME,
"IF I DON'T HAVE IT
I HAVE ANXIETY ATTACKS.
I NEED TO HAVE CHOCOLATE,
I CAN'T STOP EATING IT."
SOME PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR
WITH THESE UNCONTROLLABLE URGES,
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S FOR COOKIES
OR CAKE OR ICE CREAM
OR POTATO CHIPS,
AND A LOT OF IT
CAUSES WEIGHT PROBLEMS.
SO HE SAID, "THERE'S A WAY,
IN FIVE MINUTES,
"THAT WE CAN REDUCE
OR ELIMINATE
THIS ADDICTIVE,
UNCONTROLLABLE URGE."
SHE SAID, "IT WON'T WORK."
SO HE SAID, "TAKE THE CHOCOLATE
OUT OF YOUR PURSE."
SHE TOOK IT OUT.
HE SAID, "OKAY, NOW--"
"GIVE IT TO YOUR FRIEND!"
HA HA HA HA!
HE SAID, "NOW SMELL
THE CHOCOLATE,"
AND SHE SMELLED IT,
AND YOU COULD SEE THE ANXIETY,
'CAUSE SHE WANTED IT SO BAD.
AND HE SAID, "ON A SCALE
OF ONE TO TEN, WHERE'S YOUR URGE
FOR THAT CHOCOLATE?"
SHE GOES, "IT'S ABOUT A TEN."
HE SAYS, "OKAY,
LET'S DO THIS TECHNIQUE."
SO HE DID THE TECHNIQUE
AND HE SAID,
"NOW WHERE'S YOUR URGE?"
SHE LOOK AT THE CHOCOLATE
AND SAID, "I DON'T WANT IT."
ALL OF HER FACIAL MUSCLES
RELAXED, HER BREATHING CHANGED,
AND HE SAID--
WHAT PAGE IS THAT?
HE SAID, "PICK UP
THE CHOCOLATE."
HE SAID, "YOU CAN
STILL EAT THE CHOCOLATE,"
SHE GOES, "I KNOW,
BUT I DON'T HAVE
THAT UNCONTROLLABLE URGE."
AND SHE GOES,
"I DON'T WANT IT."
WHEN THEY WENT BACK ON THE AIR,
A CALLER CALLED UP
AND SAID TO THE HOST,
"DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
IN THE BREAK?"
AND SHE SAID, "WHY?"
AND THE CALLER SAID,
"BECAUSE YOU LOOK
TEN YEARS YOUNGER
THEN YOU DID
JUST FIVE MINUTES AGO."
AND THE REASON WAS,
THE PARTICULAR TECHNIQUE
THAT THIS DOCTOR DEVELOPED
REDUCES STRESS IN THE BODY
AND ALL THE FACIAL MUSCLES
RELAXED
AND HER BREATHING CHANGED,
AND SHE ACTUALLY
APPEARED TEN YEARS YOUNGER
IN JUST FIVE MINUTES.
AND THE ADDICTIVE URGE
WENT AWAY.
NOW, THAT WORKS
FOR CIGARETTE SMOKING,
IN MY OPINION,
IT WORKS FOR PEOPLE
THAT ARE ADDICTED TO ANYTHING.
I SMOKED CIGARS
FOR 20 YEARS.
TRIED TO QUIT.
TOTALLY ADDICTED
TO THE NICOTINE.
USED THIS TECHNIQUE,
AND I EXPLAIN IT IN THE BOOK,
I DISCOVERED A WAY
FOR MYSELF--
IT WORKED,
I QUIT SMOKING.
YOU PASS THAT TECHNIQUE ON
IN YOUR BOOK AND NOW IT WORKS.
IT WORKED FOR ME
AND IT ABSOLUTELY
GOT RID OF MY SMOKE,
AND I EXPLAIN THAT
IN THE BOOK.
I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE
BEEN BRAINWASHED
BY THE DRUG COMPANIES.
DO YOU THINK SO?
I THINK NOT ONLY
ARE WE BEING BRAINWASHED,
WE'RE BEING LIED TO.
YEARS AGO
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY KNEW
THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING
CAUSED DISEASE.
THEY KNEW IT IN 1950,
THEY LIED ABOUT IT,
THEY HID THE INFORMATION,
THEY LIED ABOUT IT
BEFORE CONGRESS.
IN MY OPINION,
THE DRUG COMPANIES KNOW
THAT THE DRUGS
THAT THEY'RE SELLING
ARE CAUSING DISEASE
AND ARE INEFFECTIVE.
THEY KNOW THIS,
THEY'RE HIDING THE RESEARCH.
THEY KNOW THAT
THERE ARE NATURAL CURES
FOR EVERY DISEASE.
THEY KNOW THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR HERPES,
THEY KNOW THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR DIABETES,
THEY KNOW THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR CANCER.
THEY KNOW THERE'S A NATURAL CURE
FOR DEPRESSION, FOR ACID REFLUX.
BUT THEY CAN'T MAKE MONEY
SELLING NATURAL CURES.
THEY ONLY MAKE MONEY
SELLING PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS.
CAN I INTERRUPT YOU
JUST ONCE?
YES.
IS THERE EVERY ANY TIME
WHERE SURGERY IS NECESSARY,
IN YOUR OPINION?
YES. IF I PERSON
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR 40 OR 50 YEARS
AND THEY NEED
A HIP REPLACEMENT
BECAUSE THEY'VE
PRETTY MUCH WORN IT OUT,
Y'KNOW, WE HAVE GREAT ADVANCES
IN THAT TYPE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE.
AND CERTAINLY DRUGS AND SURGERY
ARE GREAT IN CRISIS SITUATIONS.
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE,
"IF I'M IN A CAR CRASH,
"AND I'M DYING
AND MY BODY'S RIPPED OPEN
"AND I'M BLEEDING,
RUSH ME TO AN E.R.,
"HAVE A TRAINED MEDICAL DOCTOR
USE DRUGS AND SURGERY
TO SAVE MY LIFE."
BUT THE DRUGS AND SURGERY
ARE NOT GONNA PREVENT DISEASE.
NO, THEY WILL NOT.
AND YOU ARE INTO
MORE OF THE PREVENTING
OF DISEASES.
THERE ARE WAYS TO CURE IT
ONCE YOU KNOW THE NATURAL CURES.
I DO WANT TO TELL PEOPLE
HOW TO GET IT.
THIS IS THE NEW BOOK,
IT'S THE NEW VERSION,
IT'S CALLED "NATURAL CURES
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT."
NOW, THE ORIGINAL VERSION,

OF ALL TIME,

ABOUT CANCER OR HEART DISEASE
OR DIABETES OR ACID REFLUX

OR ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER,
OR OBESITY,

ELIMINATE ADDICTIONS.

MY NEWEST BOOK ON CD,
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THE TITLE,
IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN CENSORED BY
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.
OH!
THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK--
I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT
HOW THE GOVERNMENT
IS CENSORING INFORMATION--
IT'S NOT DIRTY OR ANYTHING?
NO, BUT THEY DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
IT'S THE WEIGHT LOSS SECRET
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT.
AND THE GOVERNMENT TOLD ME
THAT IF I MENTION THIS TITLE--
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TELLING ME
HOW I CAN TITLE A BOOK.
THEY SAID THEY WILL
BURN THE BOOKS.
THIS IS INCLUDED FREE.
AND I'M ALSO GONNA INCLUDE
THE LAST FEW ISSUES
OF MY NEWSLETTER.
I HAVE A MONTHLY NEWSLETTER
THAT COMES OUT.
THERE ARE VIRTUALLY HUNDREDS
OF NEW DISCOVERIES
ON NATURAL CURES
EVERY SINGLE MONTH,
AND I HAVE A NEWSLETTER
THAT COMES OUT WITH
THESE DISCOVERIES.
THERE ARE NO ADS
IN THESE NEWSLETTERS,
I DON'T SELL ANY
SUPPLEMENTS OR PRODUCTS,
IT'S ALL INFORMATION,
AND I'M GONNA INCLUDE THESE
FREE OF CHARGE.
SO WHEN YOU CALL,
YOU GET THE BOOK,
YOU GET THE WEIGHT LOSS CD,
MY NEWEST BOOK ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS
ON A CD, IT'S FREE,
PLUS THE NEWSLETTERS FREE,
AND YOU'LL ALSO GET
A SUBSCRIPTION TO MY NEWSLETTER
IF YOU WANT.
BUT YOU CAN CALL
AND GET ALL THE INFORMATION.
BUT IF YOU DO WANT THE BOOK,
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CALL
AND GET THE BOOK TO HELP
SUPPORT THIS INFORMATION.
YOU KNOW, KEVIN,
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
AND I DO NOT THINK, UNLESS
WE HAVE THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE,
THAT WE HAVE ANY WAY
THAT WE CAN DISCUSS
EVEN RATIONALLY
WITH OUR DOCTORS.
CORRECT.
SO MANY TIMES
WE WILL TELL OUR DOCTORS,
"WELL, I'M ON THIS OR THAT,
I'M TAKING THE GREEN STUFF,
I'M DRINKING THINGS,
I'M ON THE NATURAL PRODUCTS,"
AND THE DOCTOR
KIND OF GIVES YOU THIS (smirks)
KIND OF THING.
AND THAT REALLY
FRUSTRATES ME.
BUT DOCTORS ARE NOT TAUGHT 
THE NATURAL WAY AT ALL.
THEY ARE TAUGHT
IT HAS TO BE THE KNIFE
OR IT HAS TO BE DRUGS.
EXACTLY RIGHT.
DOCTORS, WHEN THEY
GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,
AND I EXPOSE THIS IN THE BOOK,
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT DOCTORS ARE NOT TAUGHT
ANYTHING, IN EFFECT,
EXCEPT HOW TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS
AND HOW TO CUT OUT
PARTS OF YOUR ANATOMY--
IT'S CALLED SURGERY.
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE TAUGHT.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES
SEND SALES REPS
INTO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
WITH FANCY PRESENTATIONS,
AND THE PRESENTATION IS,
"DOCTOR, LET ME TELL YOU HOW
"YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR INCOME
$100,000 A YEAR.
PRESCRIBE TO YOUR PATIENTS
THIS NEW DRUG."
DRUGS ARE BEING PROMOTED
EVERYWHERE.
THEY'RE ON TELEVISION--
BUT YOU DON'T NEED THEM.
FOR EXAMPLE, ACID REFLUX.
AGAIN, WE USED
TO HAVE HEARTBURN.
THERE'S A NATURAL CURE
FOR ACID REFLUX--
APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
IS ONE OF THE NATURAL CURES.
IF YOU TAKE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
AND GO TO ANY STORE AND GET
RAW APPLE CIDER VINEGAR,
AND IF YOU JUST TAKE
A FEW SPOONS BEFORE YOUR MEALS,
IT CAN ELIMINATE INSTANTLY
THE ACID REFLUX PROBLEM
YOU HAVE IN MOST CASES.
BUT NOW,
ISN'T THAT ACIDIC?
WELL, THIS IS
THE INTERESTING THING.
PEOPLE THINK THAT
WHEN YOU HAVE ACID REFLUX,
YOU HAVE TOO MUCH ACID.
NO. YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ACID.
COME ON!
THAT'S WHAT THE BIG SCAM IS.
REMEMBER YEARS AGO
THEY HAD THESE ADS ON TV
AND YOU HAD A GLASS
MODEL OF A STOMACH?
AND IT SAID, "WATCH HOW
OUR DRUG NEUTRALIZES
THE EXCESS ACID."
AND THEY SHAKE IT.
WELL, IT DIDN'T NEUTRALIZE
THE EXCESS ACID,
IT NEUTRALIZED ALL THE ACID.
THINK ABOUT IT--YOU CAN'T JUST
NEUTRALIZE SOME, IT
NEUTRALIZED IT ALL.
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS--
AND YOU HAD NO ACID!
YOUR STOMACH NEEDS ACID
TO DIGEST FOOD.
WHEN YOU TAKE THESE DRUGS,
IT NEUTRALIZES ALL THE ACID
AND THEN YOUR BODY SAYS,
"OH, MY GOD, WE NEED ACID
TO DIGEST THE FOOD,"
AND IT PUMPS MASSIVE AMOUNTS
OF ACID INTO THE STOMACH.
BECAUSE WE'RE ACID
OR ALKALINE, RIGHT?
THAT'S YOUR BODY pH.
BUT YOU NEED ACID
IN YOUR STOMACH
TO DIGEST FOOD.
SO IF YOU TAKE
RAW APPLE CIDER VINEGAR,
IN MOST CASES
THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM.
YOU COULD ALSO GET
SOME DIGESTIVE ENZYMES.
HYDROCHLORIC ACID,
A COUPLE OF OTHER
DIGESTIVE ENZYMES YOU CAN TAKE
THAT COULD SOLVE
THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM.
DEPRESSION--AGAIN,
I MENTIONED THERE'S
A NATURAL CURE FOR DEPRESSION.
ARTHRITIS. YOU CAN GO
ON THE INTERNET--
NOW, BY THE WAY,
I DON'T SELL ANY VITAMINS,
MINERALS, HERBS,
OR ANY SUPPLEMENTS.
I'M A COMPLETE
CONSUMER ADVOCATE.
I'M THE ONLY GUY--
GARY NOLL'S A GREAT GUY,
DEEPAK CHOPRA'S A GREAT GUY,
DR. WHITAKER'S A GREAT GUY,
AND THEY CONCUR
WITH WHAT I SAY
AND I CONCUR GENERALLY
WITH WHAT THEY SAY.
BUT THEY ALL SELL
SUPPLEMENTS,
THEY ALL SELL
VITAMINS AND MINERALS.
WHICH IS OKAY.
BUT WHEN I MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION,
I HAVE NO FINANCIAL
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
I'M NOT GETTING ANY MONEY
FROM ANY SUPPLEMENT COMPANY,
I DON'T SELL ANYTHING.
SO IF I TELL SOMEBODY
TO BUY SOMETHING,
I HAVE NO FINANCIAL
INTEREST WHATSOEVER.
TO ME, THAT MAKES YOU
VERY CREDIBLE.
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT
I'M GIVING YOU
MY HONEST OPINION.
HONEST OPINION, YES.
YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S AN HONEST OPINION.
SO CETYL MYRISTOLEATE,
IF A PERSON HAS ARTHRITIS--
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS WRITE DOWN THE INITIAL "CMO,"
GO ON THE INTERNET,
YOU CAN FIND IT,
IT VIRTUALLY IS
A CURE FOR ARTHRITIS.
MY.
VIRTUALLY A CURE
FOR ARTHRITIS.
I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE AGAIN
ABOUT THE BOOK AND THE OFFER.
YOU CAN BUY THE BOOK
ALMOST EVERYWHERE NOW.
THIS NEW EDITION HAS
OVER 200 ADDITIONAL PAGES,
50 SPECIFIC DISEASES
ARE LISTED,
WITH WHAT I BELIEVE
TO BE THE NATURAL CURES.
JUST $14.95.
BUT IF YOU CALL
ON TELEVISION NOW
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET THE BOOK,
AND WE DO HAVE RUSH SHIPPING
AND OVERNIGHT SHIPPING
AVAILABLE,
BUT I'M ALSO GONNA INCLUDE
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO
WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT
MY NEWEST BOOK ON CD,
WHICH HAS BEEN CENSORED
BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE CENSORING IN
JUST A MINUTE, TOO.
IT'S CALLED
"THE WEIGHT LOSS SECRET
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW."
THERE'S ANOTHER TITLE HERE,
BUT THE FTC SAID
IF I MENTION THE TITLE
THAT THEY'LL PROSECUTE ME
AND THEY'LL BURN THESE.
NOW, WE LIVE IN AMERICA,
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FREE SPEECH.
YES.
THERE IS NO FREE SPEECH.
I KNOW THAT.
SO IT'S FREE WHEN YOU CALL.
AND I'LL ALSO SEND YOU
A FEW OF MY LAST ISSUES
OF MY NEWSLETTER FREE OF CHARGE.
AND YOU ALSO GET A SUBSCRIPTION
TO MY NEWSLETTER.
ONE TALKS ABOUT
CHOLESTEROL THERE.
AND HERE IS CANCER
PREVENTED AND CURED.
I JUST HAD CANCER.
AND NEVER HAVE A HEART ATTACK,
NEVER HAVE CLOGGED ARTERIES.
THIS IS STUFF
YOU NEED TO KNOW, PEOPLE!
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT CANCER
FOR A SECOND.
I'LL JUST READ THIS
RIGHT OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER HERE.
IT SAYS, "AS UNBELIEVABLE
AS IT SEEMS,
"THE KEY TO STOPPING
MANY CANCERS
"HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
"IT WAS A DOCTOR
THAT DISCOVERED A SERUM
THAT VIRTUALLY MADE CANCER
TUMORS VANISH IN 90 MINUTES."
IN 90 MINUTES.
90 MINUTES.
IT WAS DONE
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
THE DOCTOR WAS
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN
BY THE FDA
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
PATENT THE SERUM
AND NO DRUG COMPANY
COULD MAKE MONEY ON IT.
DR. BUDWIG DISCOVERED
THAT ALL CANCERS
HAD NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES,
SPECIFIC NUTRIENTS IN THE BLOOD
WERE NOT THERE.
AND WHEN THOSE
NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES
WERE ADDRESSED,
ALL THE CANCERS VANISHED.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
THE FDA DOES NOT WANT
NATURAL REMEDIES OUT THERE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION
APPROVES DRUGS, OKAY?
THEY HAVE COMMITTEES
THAT REVIEW THE RESEARCH--
THAT'S BEEN PAID FOR
BY THE DRUG COMPANIES,
ALL THE RESEARCH
IS PAID FOR BY
THE DRUG COMPANIES--
AND THESE COMMITTEES
REVIEW IT,
AND THEN THEY SAY,
"YES, THIS DRUG IS
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE."
NOW, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT THE MAJORITY OF MEMBERS
OF THESE COMMITTEES
ARE ON THE PAYROLL
OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.
YEAH, SO THEY BETTER AGREE!
THAT'S CALLED
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST!
THE MAJORITY
OF FDA COMMISSIONERS,
WHEN THEY LEFT THE FDA,
GO TO WORK DIRECTLY FOR
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.
NOW, IN ANY OTHER WORLD,
THAT WOULD BE CALLED A PAYOFF,
A FLAGRANT BRIBE.
YOU'D GET PUT IN JAIL FOR IT!
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
WHY THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING
TO SUPPRESS THIS INFORMATION.
THIS WAS REPORTED ON FOX NEWS:
CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS TODAY
ARE ALLOWED TO, IN EFFECT,
BUY AND SELL STOCK
ON INSIDER INFORMATION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS.
ONE CONGRESSWOMAN
FROM CALIFORNIA MADE,
IT WAS REPORTED,
$10 MILLION
BUYING AND SELLING STOCK
ON INSIDER--
INFORMATION THAT YOU AND I
DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS
TO WHAT IS GONNA BE VOTED ON
IN THE COMMITTEES
IN CONGRESS.
AND THEY MADE A LAW
THAT MADE THEMSELF EXEMPT
FROM PROSECUTION.
IF ANYONE ELSE DID THIS,
WE'LL ALL TO GO JAIL.
WE'D BE LOOKING AT
THE WORLD LIKE THIS.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO THINK ABOUT IT--
IF YOU'RE A CONGRESSMAN
AND A SENATOR
AND YOU KNOW WHAT DRUGS
ARE GONNA BE APPROVED,
WHAT DRUGS MEDICARE
IS GONNA START BUYING,
WHAT DRUGS ARE GONNA BE
SHIPPED OVERSEAS AS PART
OF THESE AIDS PACKAGES,
YOU CAN BUY AND SELL STOCK
IN THOSE DRUG COMPANIES
AND MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
AND IT'S BEING DONE
ALL THE TIME.
AND PEOPLE AREN'T BEING
EXPOSED TO THE TRUTH.
THERE'S CORRUPTION
AT ALL LEVELS.
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
TOLD ME
THAT IF I PUT
CERTAIN THINGS IN THIS BOOK
THEY WOULD SAY,
"IF YOU'RE GONNA
SELL THIS BOOK ON TV,
"LEMME TELL YOU,
YOU CAN'T SAY THIS
IN THE BOOK,
"YOU CAN'T PUT THIS
IN THE BOOK,
"YOU CAN'T PUT THAT IN THE BOOK,
AND IF YOU DO
PUT THAT IN THE BOOK"--
THIS IS A BOOK, FOLKS,
THIS IS AMERICA,
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
FREE SPEECH.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO WRITE WHATEVER I WANT.
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
SAID IF I WANNA SELL THIS BOOK
ON TELEVISION,
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
I CANNOT PUT IN THIS BOOK,
AND IF I DID,
THEY WOULD, IN EFFECT,
PROSECUTE ME
AND THEY WOULD, IN EFFECT,
TAKE THESE BOOKS
AND BURN THE BOOKS.
IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA?!
IT SOUNDS LIKE NAZI GERMANY,
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE GESTAPO.
THE FOOD AND DRUG
ADMINISTRATION
REPEATEDLY GOES INTO PEOPLE THAT
ARE SELLING NATURAL PRODUCTS
WITH ARMED AGENTS,
GUNS DRAWN.
THEY CAME INTO MY OFFICE.
I SOLD CALCIUM.
WE TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW
NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING AUTHORS
SAID THAT CANCER CAN'T LIVE IN
AN OXYGEN-RICH ENVIRONMENT,
AND CALCIUM IS
A NEEDED NUTRIENT IN THE BODY--
THE TRUTHFUL STATEMENT.
FDA SAID WE MADE
A DISEASE CLAIM,
THE CALCIUM
IS NO LONGER CALCIUM,
IT'S NOW A DRUG,
THEY CAME IN--GUNS DRAWN!--
TO SEIZE THE CALCIUM.
WHEN DID CALCIUM
BECOME A DRUG?
THIS HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME IN AMERICA,
AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THE SUPPRESSION THAT'S GOING ON
BY THE FDA AND THE FTC.
THINK ABOUT IT.
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US
FROM MONOPOLIES.
THEY'RE NOT--
THEY'RE PROTECTING
THE MONOPOLIES!
THEY'RE PROTECTING
THE MONOPOLIES' PROFITS
AT THE EXPENSE OF--
MILLIONS OF LIVES.
AT THE EXPENSE OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DYING
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
AND CAN'T GET AHOLD OF THESE.
I BELIEVE THAT 100%.
YOU TALK ABOUT
CHIROPRACTORS IN HERE,
YOU TALK ABOUT SO MANY
OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS
THAT THE HERBALISTS
CAN DO FOR YOU AND EVERYTHING,
THERE IS SO MUCH INFORMATION
IN THIS BOOK!
I THANK GOD
I READ THIS BOOK.
I AM JUST OFF CHEMOTHERAPY,
AND I AM STILL
SUFFERING THE EFFECTS
OF CHEMOTHERAPY--
VERY NUMB HANDS,
MY TONGUE IS VERY NUMB,
GETTING TERRIBLE BACKACHES--
SO MANY THINGS
ARE HAPPENING TO ME
AS A RESULT--
OF THE CHEMO.
I'VE HAD THREE GIRLFRIENDS DIE,
NOT OF CANCER,
THEY DIED AS A RESULT
OF THE CHEMOTHERAPY.
THE TREATMENTS,
EXACTLY.
I GET THOUSANDS OF LETTERS
EVERY WEEK FROM PEOPLE
WHO GOT THE BOOK
AND ARE APPLYING
THE TECHNIQUES IN THE BOOK,
AND THEY'RE SAYING--
ONE EXAMPLE:
A WOMAN THAT I MET
IN ARIZONA.
SHE HAD A CANE, AND SHE SAID,
"I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.
IS THERE A NATURAL CURE?"
I SAID, "FIRST OFF,
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
"I'M NOT PRESCRIBING.
"GO SEE A LICENSED
HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER
"WHO DOESN'T USE
DRUGS AND SURGERY,
BUT LET ME GIVE YOU
A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS."
I SAID, "MOST M.S. SYMPTOMS
ARE CAUSED BY A FOOD ADDITIVE,
"SOMETHING THAT YOU EAT,
"THAT THE FOOD COMPANIES
ARE PUTTING IN THE FOOD.
"IF YOU ELIMINATE IT,
YOUR M.S. SYMPTOMS
WOULD PROBABLY GO AWAY.
PLUS IT'S CAUSED
BY HEAVY METAL TOXICITY.
OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH."
LOADED WITH DENTAL WORK.
I SAID, "IF YOU GET RID
OF THE DENTAL WORK
"AND STOP EATING
THIS FOOD ADDITIVE,
YOUR SYMPTOMS SHOULD VANISH."
SHE SAID, "I'LL TRY IT."
THREE MONTHS LATER
SHE CALLED ME,
SHE SAID ALL...
ALL OF HER M.S. SYMPTOMS
HAVE MIRACULOUSLY VANISHED.
SHE WAS NOT WALKING
WITH THE CANE ANYMORE.
SEE, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW.
THE DRUG INDUSTRY
WANTS TO MAKE MONEY
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.
THE DO NOT WANT TO CURE DISEASE.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO
PREVENT DISEASE.
IF THEY DID,
THEY'D BE OUT OF BUSINESS.
NOW, I'VE ONLY GOT
A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEFT,
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT.
THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY
SPECIFICALLY
AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY
IN GENERAL
IS KNOWINGLY AND PURPOSELY
PUTTING SECRET INGREDIENTS,
CHEMICALS, IN THE FOOD
WE'RE EATING IN AMERICA
TO PURPOSELY MAKE YOU
ADDICTED TO THE FOOD.
OH, I KNOW,
I BELIEVE THAT.
TO MAKE YOU HUNGRIER
AND MAKE YOU FAT.
PEOPLE SAY, "IS THIS TRUE?"
YES. LET ME TELL YOU.
THERE'S A LAWSUIT
GOING ON RIGHT NOW
WHERE MY INSIDERS TELL ME
THAT WHEN
THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS
OF SOME OF THE LARGEST
FOOD MANUFACTURERS IN AMERICA
HAVE BEEN SUBPOENAED,
THEY'RE FINDING INGREDIENTS THAT
ARE NOT LISTED ON THE LABEL,
THAT ARE BEING, IN EFFECT,
ILLEGALLY PUT INTO THE FOOD.
THE REASON THEY CAN
GET AWAY WITH IT IS BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T
REVERSE-ANALYZE IT OUT.
THAT'S WHY WHEN PEOPLE
COME FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES
TO AMERICA
AND THEY EAT "A NORMAL DIET,"
THEY BLOW UP LIKE A BALLOON.
AND I'VE DISCOVERED THIS
AND I TALK ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK,
I TALK ABOUT THE WAYS
TO ERADICATE OBESITY.
IF A PERSON'S
HUNGRY ALL THE TIME,
THERE ARE WAYS TO GET RID
OF THAT HUNGER NATURALLY.
WELL, SEE,
DIET SODAS, FOR ONE THING.
DIET SODAS MAKE YOU WANT TO
EAT SOMETHING WITH THEM.
EXACTLY.
AND THEY COME VERY, VERY--
YOU WANT ONE
ALL THE TIME.
I WANT TO KEEP ONE AROUND
ALL THE TIME.
BILL O'REILLY ON FOX NEWS SAID
IT'S BEING CALLED THE NEW CRACK.
BECAUSE IT CAN BE SO
PHYSICALLY ADDICTING
AND IN MY OPINION
ACTUALLY MAKES YOU
AND INCREASES YOUR APPETITE.
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
IS AN INGREDIENT
BEING PUT IN THE FOOD
THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES
PEOPLE'S WEIGHT.
AGAIN, IF YOU ARE
WATCHING RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BOOK,
WE GOT A COUPLE
OF MINUTES LEFT,
"NATURAL CURES THEY DON'T
WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT."
THERE IS, FOLKS, A NATURAL CURE
FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DISEASE.
THERE'S WAYS, WITHOUT
DRUGS AND SURGERY,

>>> COMING UP ON "GOOD MORNING
AMERICA," THE WOMEN
AT WIMBLEDON, FEMALE PLAYERS ARE
FIGHTING TO EARN AS MUCH
AS THE MEN.
>>> AND OUT OF CONTROL, WHAT DO
YOU DO WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE
REALLY LOSING IT?
>>> IN THIS MAKEOVER CRAZE
CULTURE, IS ANYONE OR ANYTHING
SACRED?
APPARENTLY NOT.
EVEN ENGLAND'S OLDEST AND MOST
ESTEEMED TENNIS TOURNAMENT IS
UPDATING ITS LOOK WITH THE HELP
OF A MAJOR AMERICAN DESIGNER.
IN THIS "NIGHTLINE PLAYBACK"
SEGMENT, NICK WATT MAKES SPORT
OF THE BIGGEST FASHION NEWS
TO HIT TENNIS.
>> Reporter: THIS IS CENTRE
COURT AT WIMBLEDON, ARGUE REPLY
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PIECES
OF TURF ON EARTH.
AND IT'S THE EPICENTER
OF UNDERSTATED ENGLISH ELEGANCE.
THE PLAYERS WEAR WHITE,
THE SPECTATORS EAT STRAWBERRIES
AND CREAM THIS YEAR THERE'S
A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WHICH
IN THE HISTORY OF WIMBLEDON
AMOUNTS TO A REVOLUTION. THAT
WAS DAVID LAUREN, SON OF RALPH,
AND THIS IS WHAT WIMBLEDON BALL
BOYS AND GIRLS, LINE JUDGES
AND UMPIRES ARE WEARING THIS
SEASON.
>> THIS IS PROBABLY
THE MOST EXCITING FASHION SHOW
WE'VE EVER HAD.
>> Reporter: RALPH LAUREN HAS
SIGNED A FIVE-YEAR DEAL
TO CLOTHE WIMBLEDON'S BIT PART
PLAYERS.
A BRIT LAST WON THE SINGLES BACK
IN 1936 AMERICANS HAVE WON 26
TITLES SINCE THEN.
AND NOW AN AMERICAN DESIGNER IS
TELLING THE BRITS HOW TO DRESS.
WELL, IT'S NOT QUITE THAT
SIMPLE.
AS ROGER FEDERER STRODE
ONTO THE COURT TO BEGIN
THE DEFENSE OF HIS TITLE.
>> VERY GOOD TO SEE THE NEW
OUTFITS.
THE BLUE LOOKS SMART
WITH THE WHITE PIPING ON THESE
BLAZERS.
>> Reporter: IT ALMOST COULD
HAVE BEEN THE 1930s WHEN
THE BRITS STILL HAD A CHANCE
RALPH LAUREN'S STYLE IS BASED
PRETTY MUCH ON --
>> ON ENGLAND.
>> Reporter: AND THAT'S EAST
COAST COUNTRY CLUB STYLE.
>> YEAH.
BUT IT ALL REALLY STARTS,
YOU KNOW, RIGHT HERE IN LONDON
AND THE SHIRES, THE STATELY
HOME.
IT'S TOTALLY AND UTTERLY BRITISH
TO THE CORE.
>> Reporter: BUT RALPH LAUREN IS
SPORTING THAT BACK TO US.
>> NEW CASTLE.
>> Reporter: CAR PARKED
IN DETROIT AS THEY SAY THERE.
>> IS THAT WHAT THEY SAY?
>> Reporter: FOR YEARS WIMBLEDON
OFFICIALS WORE ILL-FITTING GREEN
AND PURPLE.
DESIGNER UNKNOWN.
>> THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT COLORS
TO WEAR.
THEY'RE KIND OF -- THEY'RE SORT
OF SOGGY, WEIGH YOU DOWN.
THEY DON'T LOOK CRISP.
>> Reporter: DRAIN THE COLOR
FROM YOUR FACE?
>> TOTALLY.
AND THEY DON'T LOOK THAT SMART.
>> Reporter: WHEREAS DARK BLUE
WITH THE WHITE CONTRAST CAN SUIT
ANY COLORING.
>> SUITS ANYBODY.
AND INSTANTLY IT LOOKS
AUTHORITATIVE.
>> Reporter: A GOOD CHANGE?
>> OF COURSE I THINK A BIT
OF FASHION DOES GOOD.
TO THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB.
>> Reporter: COUNT HOW MANY
TIMES
THE LINE JUDGES CALL THEIR NEW
OUTFITS LOVELY.
>> I THINK IT'S LOVELY.
IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE A CHANGE
FROM THE OLD UNIFORM.
>> IT'S LOVELY.
IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE.
THE FIRST THING IS -- THAT
STRIKES YOU WHEN YOU TOUCH IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT FEELS --
OH, IT'S LIKE CREAM
IN YOUR HANDS.
>> WE HAVE TO TRY TO KEEP
OUR EYES ON THE COURT AND NOT
ON THE LINESMEN.
>> Reporter: DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO LOOK
AT THE LOVELY BLAZER THE UMPIRE
IS WEARING OTHER THAN
CONCENTRATE?
>> I THINK I CAN KEEP MY EYES
TO THE BALL, YES.
>> Reporter: THE OFFICIALS ENJOY
THEIR MAKEOVER, THE PLAYERS HAVE
BEEN WARNED FOR THE UMPTEENTH
TIME, APPEAR ON COURT DRESSED
IN A MANNER DEEMED UNSUITABLE
BY THE COMMITTEE, AND YOU'RE
OUT.
>> TENNIS NEEDS A LITTLE BIT
OF A LIFT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.
I THINK IT'S QUITE NICE TO SEE
A BIT OF TAN CLEAVAGE.
IT'S QUITE CUTE TO SEE FRILLY
KNICKERS.
WE SAW THEM IN THE '20s
AND '30s.
I DON'T THINK THAT HURT, AS LONG
AS IT'S WHITE.
>> Reporter: ANDRE AGASSI
BOYCOTTED WIMBLEDON FOR THREE
YEARS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T BEAR
TO DITCH THE GARISH THREADS.
HE EVENTUALLY CAVED IN AND WON
HERE IN '92, WEARING ALL WHITE,
BUT HE STILL LOOKED LIKE FARRAH
FAWCETT FROM THE NECK UP.
>> THE INTERESTING THING
WITH WIMBLEDON IS THE BALANCE
BETWEEN TRADITION
AND INNOVATION.
AND I THINK IF WE SAY WE'LL STAY
WITH TRADITION FOR THE SAKE
OF IT, WE'LL FALL BEHIND.
WE'LL BE OLD FASHIONED.
>> Reporter: YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GO TO ARTIFICIAL GRASS?
>> NO, THERE ARE SOME THINGS
SACROSANCT >> Reporter: UMPIRES'
UNIFORMS AREN'T SACROSANCT.
AND NEITHER ARE THE REGULAR RAIN
DELAYS.
>> WHAT A PITY THIS IS.
>> Reporter: THEY'RE BUILDING
A ROOF OVER CENTRE COURT THAT
WILL BE READY IN TIME
FOR WIMBLEDON 2009. THERE'S BEEN
A DROUGHT HERE IN THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT THIS MORNING
AS THE TOURNAMENT BEGAN, IT
POURED.
FOR "NIGHTLINE," NICK WATTS
AT WIMBLEDON.
>> NOW WE HOPE THE COLORS DON'T
RUN IN THAT RAIN, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I'M SURPRISED THEY ALLOWED
THE LOGOS TO BE THAT BIG.
>> THAT WAS SORT OF A SURPRISE
IT IS AN INTERESTING CHANGE.
EVEN PETER WAS SOUNDING
ON OF HERE, OUR FASHION PLATE.
>> EVERYONE'S GOT AN OPINION.
>> DOESN'T LIKE THE WHITE
PIPING.
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, MORE NEWS
COMING UP HERE.
>>> WELCOME BACK.
I'M SONYA CRAWFORD
IN WASHINGTON.
TIME FOR OVERSEAS NEWS,
AND FOR THAT WE TURN TO DECLAN
CURRY OF THE BBC IN LONDON, WHO
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO RENAME
OUR WORLD CUP CORRESPONDENT,
RIGHT, DECLAN?
>> Reporter: I'M HOPING THAT
SOMEONE BETTER WILL COME ALONG
WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT SOCCER
TO TALK ABOUT THE WORLD CUP
FOR YOU.
THAT MIGHT MAKE AN IMPROVEMENT
IN THE COVERAGE.
I SPENT THE WEEKEND WITH SOME
FRIENDS OF MINE FROM AUSTRALIA,
WHO HAVE COME OVER ON VACATION.
THEY WERE PARTICULARLY KEEN THAT
THEY SPENT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
WATCHING SOCCER BECAUSE
AUSTRALIA WAS PLAYING ITALY
AND THEY THOUGHT AUSTRALIA, WHO
MANY OF US DIDN'T KNOW HAD
A SOCCER TEAM, MIGHT GET
THROUGH TO THE FAR REACHES
OF THE WORLD CUP.
BAD NEWS FOR THEM.
HA, HA, HA.
THIS IS ONE OF THE FRONT PAGES
FROM ONE OF THE TABLOID
NEWSPAPERS HERE IN LONDON THIS
MORNING.
THE HEADLINE SAYS IT ALL,
THE AUSTRALIANS KNOCKED OUT
IN SOME CONTROVERSY, THIS ONE.
BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY LATE
PENALTY BY THE ITALIANS THAT LED
TO THEIR VICTORY OVER AUSTRALIA.
THE AUSTRALIANS THINKING THERE
WAS A LITTLE UNFAIR PLAY
INVOLVED IN THIS.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT A PROPER
SPORT?
LET'S TALK ABOUT TENNIS, SHALL
WE?
WIMBLEDON.
THE GREAT ENGLISH TRADITION
OF WIMBLEDON STARTED YESTERDAY
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
IT STARTED TO RAIN.
AFTER WEEKS AND WEEKS OF BRIGHT,
BAKING SUNSHINE AND WARM
WEATHER, AS SOON AS THE TENNIS
STARTS IN LONDON, THE CLOUDS
OPENED AND THEY GOT
APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES' WORTH
OF PLAY OUT OF THE ENTIRE DAY
YESTERDAY.
WHAT DO TENNIS PLAYERS DO
NOWADAYS WHENEVER THEY'RE RAINED
OFF AND THEY CAN'T KNOCK
THE BALLS ABOUT ON THE COURT?
THEY SIT DOWN AND LOG
ON TO THE INTERNET AND WRITE
THEIR OWN BLOGS.
THIS IS THE TIMES OF LONDON
SHOWING THE BALL BOYS AND GIRLS
BRINGING THE COVERS ACROSS
THE COURT ONCE THE RAIN STARTS.
OVER HERE YOU GET EXCERPTS
FROM A NUMBER OF THE BLOGS
FROM THE PLAYERS, INCLUDING
THE BRITISH HOPEFUL ANDY MURRAY,
THE ONE THE BRITS ARE PUTTING
ALL THEIR MONEY ON THIS YEAR
AFTER MANY, MANY YEARS
OF BACKING TIM HENMAN
AND GETTING NOWHERE.
HE SAID HE SPENT HIS TIME
WATCHING "BIG BROTHER."
>> YOU'VE DONE A CREDIBLE JOB
AS OUR SPORTS CORRESPONDENT THIS
MORNING.
BRIEFLY, YOU SAID YOU HAD SAD
NEWS OUT OF GERMANY THIS
MORNING?
>> Reporter: SAD NEWS
ABOUT THE RUNAWAY BEAR.
THIS IS THE BEAR'S TRAVELS WE'VE
BEEN FOLLOWING.
HE'S BEEN WANDERING AROUND
SOUTHERN GERMANY FOR SEVEN
WEEKS.
LOCAL OFFICIALS THOUGHT HE WAS
LIVELY
AND THEN GOT MORE CONCERNED
AS HE ATE MORE LOCAL SHEEP
AND BIRDS AND THINGS.
THE NEWS IS HE WAS SHOT
YESTERDAY.
HE WAS TRACKED DOWN FINALLY
BY THE GERMAN HUNTERS
AND BY THE SPECIAL DOGS BROUGHT
DOWN FROM FINLAND TO TRACK HIM
DOWN.
THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ARE
REFUSING TO REVEAL THE NAME
OF THE HUNTER WHO FIRED
THE BULLET BECAUSE THEY'RE
CONCERNED THEY MAY GET DEATH
THREATS OF THEIR OWN.
>> HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET ANY
HATE MAIL FROM THE LOVERS
OF THAT BEAR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DECLAN CURRY AT THE BBC
IN LONDON FOR JOINING US.
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, SONYA.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
>>> ONE MORE NOTE FROM THE UK
THIS MORNING, DETAILS OF PRINCE
CHARLES' FINANCES WERE RELEASED
YESTERDAY, AND THE HEIR
TO THE THRONE'S INCOME WAS UP
6% THIS YEAR TO $25 MILLION.
OF THAT SUM, HE SPENT NEARLY $12
MILLION ON OFFICIAL DUTIES AND
CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES, CLOSE TO
$6 MILLION IN TAXES, AND CLES TO
$8 MILLION
ON HIS 105 STAFF MEMBERS.
HIS OFFICE SAYS THE PRINCE WORKS
HARD AND HIS LIFESTYLE IS
BY NO MEANS EXTRAVAGANT.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE RAISED
$200 MILLION FOR CHARITY.
THAT'S IT FOR THIS SEGMENT.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN THE NEXT BREAK.
>>> THIS IS THE PART OF THE SHOW
WHERE WE DO MINDLESS CELEBRITY
NEWS NOBODY CARES ABOUT,
AND WE LOVE IT!
>> LOVE IT, JUST LOVE IT,
DARLING.
>> "THE SKINNY" IN THE HOUSE!
WOO!
>> IT NEVER GETS OLD, DOES IT?
>> NEVER, NEVER.
>> MAYBE IT DOES A LITTLE TINY
>> WELL, IT CHANGES EVERY DAY.
>> YES, YES.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE, THAT'S
THE THING.
>>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S START OFF
HERE WITH J.K. ROWLING,
THE AUTHOR OF THE HARRY POTTER
BOOKS IN BRITAIN IS NOW SAYING
THAT
THEY MAY IN THE SEVENTH BOOK
KILL OFF A COUPLE CHARACTERS.
SHE SAYS THESE ARE TWO
CHARACTERS SHE HADN'T INTENDED
TO KILL OFF.
THERE'S SOME SPECULATION IT MAY
BE HARRY POTTER.
BUT SHE ISN'T SAYING.
>> SHE SAYS WE'RE DEALING
WITH PURE EVIL.
PURE EVIL WON'T GO AFTER EXTRAS
BUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS SHE SAID
SHE ACTUALLY WROTE THE ENDING
ALREADY, SEVEN YEARS AGO, BEFORE
THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED.
WE'LL SEE HOW THE BOOK GOES.
>> SHE WROTE THE LAST CHAPTER
OF THE SEVENTH BOOK
IN 1990.
EVERYONE'S THINKING, WHY DID
YOU WRITE THE LAST CHAPTER FIRST
AND WORK BACKWARDS?
IT'S INTERESTING, I HADN'T
REALIZED THIS, AUTHORS
SOMETIMES LIKE TO KILL OFF
THEIR CHARACTERS BECAUSE
IN THE FUTURE THEY DON'T WANT
NON-AUTHORS TO WRITE SEQUELS.
>> YOU WOULD THINK
WITH COPYRIGHT LAWS SHE COULD
PREVENT THIS, BUT SHE SAYS IT'S
PART --
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A REALISTIC
TALE OF MAGIC.
A LOT OF THE KIDS WHO GREW UP
WITH HER BOOKS ARE GETTING OLDER
AND PERHAPS ARE MORE ABLE TO
HANDLE THIS.
>> SHE'S THE RICHEST WOMAN
IN ENGLAND, WORTH MORE THAN
THE QUEEN HERSELF.
>> SHE CAN DO WHATEVER SHE
WANTS.
>> EXACTLY.
TIME IN MY -- NAOMI
CAMPBELL IS BEING SUED
BY ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WHO SAYS
THAT SHE ENGAGED -- SHE GAVE
HER PERSONAL INJURIES,
EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION, CIVIL
ASSAULT, CIVIL BATTERY, GOES
ON AND ON.
NAOMI CAMPBELL IS ALSO FACING
CRIMINAL CHARGES IN THE UNITED
STATES.
SHE COULD FACE SEVEN YEARS
IN PRISON AND DEPORTATION.
NOT A VERY HAPPY HOUSEHOLD.
>> THE NEWS OF THIS LATEST
CHARGE OR FILE OF ASSAULT
AGAINST HER COMES TODAY OR CAME
YESTERDAY, AND TODAY SHE'S DUE
IN COURT ON THE OTHER CHARGES.
>> RIGHT, TWO SEPARATE CASES
HERE.
>> YEP.
BOY
GEORGE IN A MANHATTAN COURTROOM,
A JUDGE TOLD HIM HE WOULD GO
TO JAIL IF HE DIDN'T DO FIVE
DAYS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.
BY AUGUST 28th.
HE WENT TO THE ASSIGNMENT OFFICE
IT'S POSSIBLE HE'LL BE RAKING
LEAVES IN CENTRAL PARK,
SERIOUSLY. HE WANTED TO DO
AN HIV/AIDS CHARITABLE
FOUNDATION AND THE JUDGE
REJECTED THAT.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING
TO END UP DOING COMMUNITY
SERVICE.
>> THIS BEGAN WITH AN ASSAULT
REPORT OF AN INCIDENT, BURGLARY,
AND THAT CAN GET YOU IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE.
>> AND THEN THEY FOUND COCAINE
AT HIS APARTMENT.
>> BIGGER TROUBLE.
>>> THAT'S A LOOK AT "THE
SKINNY."
ARE WE GOOD?
DO WE HAVE TIME?
>> GEORGE BUSH HAD SOME FAMOUS
MUSICIAN, B. B. KING, ERVIN
MAYFIELD AND PATTY AUSTIN
AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO CELEBRATE
>> WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.
DON'T TELL THEM.
I HATE HAVING MY PICTURE TAKEN.
I HATE HAVING TO GET ALL FUSSED
UP.
I DO LIKE TO SHOP, BUT I LIKE
TO SHOP FOR, LIKE, BLUE JEANS
AND BOOTS.
OH, I LOVE THIS!
I'M NOT SO GOOD WITH THE
DRESSES AND THE HIGH HEELS AND
THE MAKEUP AND THE GOOP AND
SITTING AROUND AND TALKING
ABOUT YOURSELF.
I MEAN, IT'S SO BORING.
(LAUGHS)
AND THEY WANTED ME TO DO THIS
STUFF WHERE I GO
"HI, I'M RACHAEL RAY.
WATCH THE SHOW BECAUSE YOU'LL
GET BLAH BLAH BLAH."
WHAT?
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK, GUYS.
>> EVERYONE NEEDS A LITTLE R&R.
RACH
>>> IT'S TUESDAY MORNING.
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS HOUSING
IRREPLACEABLE PIECES OF HISTORY
FLOODED BY THE EAST COAST RAINS
WHICH CREATED A SOGGY MESS
IN THE NATION'S CAPITOL.
CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY ABC, INC.
>>> YOU THINK SOME OF THESE
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS WOULD BE
SECURE IN SOME WAY AND IMMUNE
TO THIS FLOODING, BUT YOU HAVE
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES WHERE
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
AND CONSTITUTION IS, FILLING UP
WITH WATER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
A LITTLE RAIN GOES A LONG WAY.
NOT JUST A LITTLE RAIN. I SHOULD
SAY OVER A FOOT OF RAIN
IN THE D.C. AREA.
>> IN SOME PLACES.
AS WE SAID, IT SHOWS PLACES.
AS WE SAID, IT SHOWS NO SIGNS
OF LETTING UP. WE'LL HAVE THAT
COMING UP. GOOD MORNING.
I'M RON CORNING.

PROBLEMS FOR DAYS TO COME.
ABC'S SONYA CRAWFORD BARELY MADE
IT TO THE WASHINGTON BUREAU
AND SHE'S JOINING US LIVE
WITH THE LATEST.
GOOD MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING, RON.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL
OF THE DAMAGE, IT'S HARD
TO BELIEVE THIS ISN'T RESIDUAL
RAIN FROM A HURRICANE
OR TROPICAL STORM.
MANY OF THE AREAS HIT HARDEST
NEEDED RAIN, BUT CERTAINLY NOT
THIS MUCH.
LAST NIGHT WE HAD MORE REMINDERS
THAT THIS STORM ISN'T GOING
ANYWHERE JUST YET.
ROARING CLAPS OF THUNDER
AND A LONG DOWNPOUR WOKE ME UP.
IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER
WATER-LOGGED DAY UP AND DOWN

WASHINGTON, D.C.
PUMPS ARE RUNNING NONSTOP,
BRINGING THOUSANDS OF GALLONS
OF WATER OUT OF THE BASEMENTS
OF THE IRS, THE NATIONAL
ARCHIVES, THE COMMERCE
DEPARTMENT, AND THE SMITHSONIAN
MUSEUM.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS
SO BADLY SOAKED, IT MAY BE
CLOSED FOR UP TO A WEEK.
WORKERS PULLED SENSITIVE
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT OUT
OF THE BUILDING.
FOR A TOWN THAT SHUTS DOWN
FOR A COUPLE OF INCHES OF SNOW,
MORE THAN 7 INCHES OF RAIN
IN TWO DAYS WAS A DISASTER.
COMMUTERS STRUGGLED
WITH WASHOUTS AND MUDSLIDES
ON MAJOR ROADWAYS.
COMMUTER RAIL LINES SUSPENDED
SERVICE, SUBWAYS WERE DELAYED,
AND AMTRAK STOPPED RUNNING
TRAINS SOUTH.

FASTER THAN I'LL ABLE TO GET
THERE BY TRAIN IT LOOKS LIKE.

WERE NO MATCH FOR THE WATER.
IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE GROUND IS
SATURATED.
IN GEORGIA, A ROOF COLLAPSE.
IN DELAWARE, HOMES ARE COVERED.
IN PITTSBURGH, A STATE
OF EMERGENCY.
WITHOUT MUCH OF A BREAK
IN THE WEATHER, HOMEOWNERS
STRUGGLED TO CLEAN UP FLOODED
BASEMENTS, TENS OF THOUSANDS
REMAIN WITHOUT POWER,
AND EMERGENCY CREWS ARE TIRED
OUT.
>> FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS WE'RE
HOLDING ABOUT 70 CALLS NOW, ALL
FLOOD VEHICLES, CARS THAT
THE WATER LEVELS ARE UP
TO THE DASHBOARD.
>> Reporter: AMTRAK SERVICE IS
SUPPOSED TO RETURN TO NORMAL
TODAY, BUT SEVERAL FEDERAL
BUILDINGS REMAIN CLOSED.
WE WON'T KNOW THE EXTENT
OF THE DAMAGE TO THE REGION
UNTIL THE STORM IS DONE.
AND FORECASTERS SAY WE WON'T GET
OUR NEXT BREAK UNTIL TUESDAY
NIGHT. RON?
>> SONYA, THANK YOU. ABC'S SONYA
CRAWFORD REPORTING FROM A WET

AS FOR THE REST OF THE NATION,
FLORIDA WILL GET MORE RAIN,
AS WILL THE GREAT LAKES
IN THE MIDWEST, AND THE FOUR
CORNERS STATES OF THE SOUTHWEST
WILL ALSO HAVE SCATTERED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS.
COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL PREVAIL
ACROSS MUCH OF THE NATION TODAY
BUT IT WILL BE VERY HOT ALONG
THE WEST COAST.
>>> IN CENTRAL MISSOURI,
AT LEAST TWO OF THE TEN PEOPLE
BELIEVED TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE
OF A COLLAPSED BUILDING HAVE
BEEN RESCUED.
ONE VICTIM WALKED AWAY
FROM THE SCENE.
ANOTHER WAS

UNDERWAY SINCE THE STRUCTURE
CRUMBLED LAST NIGHT.
ALL BUT ONE OF THE VICTIMS WAS
ABLE TO MAKE CONTACT
WITH OFFICIALS BY CELL PHONE.

>>> POLICE OFFICERS FIRST
ON THE SCENE WERE AMONG

HER CHILDREN BUT THE DEFENSE
BLAMES POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS.
POLICE SAID WHILE YATES COULD

THIS MORNING BEHIND THE SCENES
OF THE WAR OF IRAQ, A FRONT LINE
OF A DIFFERENT KIND, JOURNALISTS
PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK EVERY
DAY TO COVER THE WAR.
ABC'S MIGUEL MARQUEZ HAS BEEN
IN IRAQ COUNTLESS TIMES AND HAS
THIS INSIDE LOOK AT OUR BAGHDAD
BUREAU.
>> Reporter: IT'S EARLY MORNING
IN BAGHDAD SUNDAY MORNING.
A LOT
OF PEOPLE ASK WHAT WE DO EVERY
DAY HERE.
THIS IS OUR BUREAU AND HERE'S A
LITTLE BIT OF OUR DAY.
IT'S BEEN A BUSY COUPLE
OF WEEKS.
ZARQAWI WAS KILLED
AND THE PRESIDENT MADE
A SURPRISE VISIT.
MATT WAS BUREAU CHIEF THROUGH
ALL OF IT.
>> ON A BUSY DAY IT'S JUST
NONSTOP.
WE WORK FROM VERY EARLY
IN THE MORNING AND VERY LATE
AT NIGHT AND IT'S MIND BOGGLING
WHEN YOU TRY TO WORK OUT
THE TIME DIFFERENCES.
>> Reporter: BAGHDAD IS'S HOURS
HOURS -- 8 HOURS
AHEAD OF U.S.
"WORLD NEWS NOW" COMES
ON AT 2:30 A.M. EVERY DAY FEELS
LIKE TWO DAYS IN ONE.
WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE IN LONDON,
I'M GOING TO IRAQ, WHAT'S
THE REACTION?
>> WHAT'S THE REACTION?
YOU'RE BONKERS.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY BONKERS.
>> Reporter: SPEAKING OF BONKERS
MINDING ALL THE TECHNOLOGY
IN KEEPING US ON THE AIR IS
A FULL-TIME JOB AS WELL.
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
ENGINEERING.
THIS IS FRED, THE MOST FANTASTIC
ENGINEER ON THE PLANET.
>> NOT TRUE.
>> Reporter: I WISH I COULD
INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR EXCELLENT
IRAQI STAFF BUT EVERYONE'S JUST
A LITTLE CONCERNED
ABOUT SECURITY, OF COURSE. IT'S
THAT SAME CONCERN THAT KEEPS US
IN OUR BUREAU MOST OF THE DAY.
IT IS COMFORTABLE, BUT IT CAN
GET A LITTLE CRAMPED.
>> IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST GO
RUNNING OR WALKING
IN THE STREETS OF BAGHDAD.
SO GETTING A GOOD CARDIO WORKOUT
IS TOUGH WHILE YOU'RE HERE.
THIS RUNNING MACHINE, VERY
POPULAR.
BUT THE PART OF THE DAY WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MOST IS DEFINITELY
LUNCH.
>> TUNA, SALAD.
>> Reporter: AND, OF COURSE,
DINNER.
>> DEEP FRIED CHICKEN, BATTERED.
UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T JUST EAT
AROUND HERE.
WE HAVE TO WORK TOO.

I MEAN, WE SORT OF CONSIDER
OURSELVES HERE A FAMILY, HOWEVER
DYSFUNCTIONAL.
THEY REALLY DO THERE AS WELL.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE DAYS ARE
WHEN YOU SEE MIGUEL AT THIS
POINT ON EVERY SHOW
IN OUR BROADCAST.
THAT IS AN EXTREMELY LONG DAY.
WE SHOULD POINT OUT
THEY'RE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
GENERATOR.
MOST OF IRAQ ONLY HAS A COUPLE
HOURS OF ELECTRICITY A DAY
IF THEY'RE LUCKY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AS WE SAW THERE, NOT EASY TO TRY
TO MAINTAIN ANY SORT
OF BALANCE IN YOUR PERSONAL
LIFE.
>> IT'S THAT TREADMILL.
>> WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT.
AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK INSIDE
THE GUANTANAMO BAY PRISON CAMP.
>>> COMING UP ON "GOOD MORNING
AMERICA," THE WOMEN AT WIMBLEDON
FEMALE PLAYERS ARE FIGHTING

MAY BE THE MOST FEARED AMERICAN
DETENTION CENTER.

BOARD. ANOTHER DETAINEE NEARBY
PACES HIS 10 FOOT BY 18 FOOT

>> THEY COME OUT OF THEIR CELLS
AND GO TO SHOWER.
>> Reporter: LIEUTENANT COLONEL
KEVIN BURKE SHOWS OFF THE CELLS.
THOSE FOR DETAINEES CONSIDERED
NONCOMPLIANT --

THIS IS WHAT A DETAINEE WHO IS
NONCOMPLIANT WOULD HAVE.

COOPERATE, MORE COMFORT ITEMS
HERE.
>> IN HERE THEY HAVE A PRAYER
MAT, A PRAYER RUG PRAYER BEADS,
SKULL CAP, THE CHECKERS, CHESS,
DECK SHOES.
>> Reporter: DO YOU FEEL SORRY
FOR THEM AT ALL?
>> IT'S NOT MY JOB TO FEEL SORRY
FOR THEM.
IT IS MY JOB TO PROVIDE A FIRM,
FAIR, IMPARTIAL, AND SAFE
ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO LIVE
UNTIL THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE
IN THEIR FUTURE.
>> Reporter: AND THEN LATER
COLONEL BURKE TAKES US
INTO AN INTERROGATION ROOM WHERE
AMAZINGLY THERE'S A LAY-Z-BOY
CHAIR AND OTHER COMFORTS
FOR DETAINEES. WOULD PEOPLE
BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE
INTERROGATIONS AT GUANTANAMO BAY
TAKE PLACE?
>> AND THEY MAY LOOK AT THIS
PICTURE AND SAY, YOU'RE STAGING
THIS.
THIS IS --.
>> WE DO HAVE INTERROGATION
ROOMS THAT ARE MORE AUSTERE THAN
THIS.
>> THE ENTIRE EFFORT IS TO BE
AS -- I KNOW THE -- IT'S HARD
TO FATHOM THIS, BUT AS CORDIAL
AS POSSIBLE UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Reporter: THAT'S SLIGHTLY
GRANDFATHERLY CIVILIAN THERE
WITH US IS PAUL RESTER,
THE DIRECTOR OF THE JOINT
INTERROGATIONS GROUP
IN GUANTANAMO BAY.
HE'S THE MAN WHO RUNS ALL
THE INTERROGATIONS OF DETAINEES
HERE.
THOUGH HE DOESN'T LIKE TO USE
THE WORD INTERROGATION.
>> INTERROGATION IS A NEGATIVE
WORD.
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL WHAT YOU DO?
>> HERE WE ARE -- WE HAVE
EVOLVED INTO CUSS STOD YAL.
INTERVIEWS.
>> Reporter: PAUL RESTER HAS
BEEN INTERROGATING
OR INTERVIEWING OR QUESTIONING
AMERICA' ENEMIES OR SUSPECTED
ENEMIES FOR 35 YEARS, GOING BACK
TO VIETNAM.
HE IS FIERCELY PROUD OF HIS WORK
AT GUANTANAMO BAY.
WHEN PEOPLE THINK
ABOUT INTERROGATIONS
AT GUANTANAMO BAY THEY THINK
ABOUT TORTURE.
>> I THINK THAT WHAT PEOPLE
FORGET IS WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS
WERE FIRST BROUGHT HERE, THERE
WERE FOUR SMOKING HOLES
IN THE GROUND.
WE HAD INDIVIDUALS WHO, IN FACT,
WERE PARTY TO OR WITTY
OF AT THE TIME PRESENT
AND FUTURE, IMMEDIATE FUTURE,
PLANS AND INTENTIONS TO CONTINUE
TO DO HARM AGAINST THE MAINLAND
OF THE UNITED STATES,
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, OR IT
THE INTERESTS ABROAD.
I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD GIVE
SOME PAUSE TO SIMPLY THROWING
SEMANTICS AROUND AND CHEAPENING
TERMS SUCH AS TORTURE AND HUMAN
RIGHTS ABUSES.
AND REALLY LOOK AT THE ROOT
OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE.
>> Reporter: SO YOU DEFINE
TORTURE FOR ME.
>> FOR ME?
>> Reporter: NO, FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE GOING TO BE INTEGRATED
BY YOU.
WHAT COUNTS AS TORTURE?
>> WE DON'T EMPLOY TORTURE.
>> Reporter: WHAT IS TORTURE?
>> FOR MYSELF, TORTURE IS
THE DELIBERATE AND SADISTIC
OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL PAIN
ON ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
OR THE PURE AND SIMPLE
SATISFACTION OF DOING IT.
IT SERVES NO REDEEMING SOCIAL
VALUE, AND ELICITING CONCRETE
INFORMATION, IT SERVES
NO REDEEMING SOCIAL VALUE
IN OBTAINING THE KNOWLEDGE
WE NEED TO COMBAT THIS
PARTICULAR ENEMY.
>> Reporter: BUT RESTER FRANKLY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOME
OF THE TECHNIQUES USED HERE
PUSHED THE LIMITS, HIS WORDS,
OF WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE.
BUT THERE WAS POLICY HERE
AT GUANTANAMO BAY THAT YOU COULD
PUT A DETAINEE IN EXPRESS
STRESS POSITIONS FOR HOURS.
>> AGAIN WHEN YOU SAY
A DETAINEE, I WANT TO BE
PERFECTLY CLEAR, THERE WERE
SPECIAL PLANS FOR SPECIFIC
DETAINEES THAT ALLOWED CERTAIN
PROCESSES, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE
IN THE PUBLIC RECORD.
>> Reporter: FORCIBLE ENEMAS?
>> EXCUSE ME?
>> Reporter: A FORCIBLE ENEMA.
>> NO, I'M NOT AWARE OF FORCIBLE
ENEMAS.
>> Reporter: THAT'S
THE ALLEGATION.
>> PEOPLE CAN ALLEGE WHAT
THEY WANT TO ALLEGE.
I'VE SEEN ANY NUMBER
OF ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE -- THAT
ARE PATENTLY OUTRAGEOUS.
>> Reporter: YOU SHORT-SHACKLED
PEOPLE TO THE FLOOR FOR HOURS
AT A TIME UNTIL THEY SOILED
THEMSELVES.
>> IF YOU WERE ABLE TO LOCATE
THE DETAINEE THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY
SHACKLED ON THE FLOOR,
IN HIS OWN EXCREMENT, PULLING
HIS HAIR OUT, BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT'S IN THAT E-MAIL, I THINK
THERE MAY BE ANOTHER EXPLANATION
THAT IS NOT RELATED
TO INTERROGATION.
THE INDIVIDUAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN
SIMPLY ILL.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
>> Reporter: AND AS FOR TWO
OF THE MOST EXPLOSIVE
ALLEGATIONS THAT DETAINEES WERE
THREATENED WITH DOGS OR MADE
TO BELIEVE THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE
DROWNED, A TECHNIQUE CALLED
WATER BORING.
DOGS USED HERE IN INTERROGATION?
>> NO.
>> Reporter: WATER BORING?
>> NO. THE OTHER EVENT
YOU MENTIONED, AGAIN, NOT
OF RECORD.
>> Reporter: MEANING, IT'S NOT
>> IT'S NOT OF RECORD AND I HAVE
NO ONE WHO HAS EVER TOLD ME
OR WITNESSED TO ME THAT IT EVER
TOOK PLACE.
>> Reporter: WHAT PAUL RESTER
DOES KNOW, HE SAYS, IS THAT
THE DETAINEES HERE REPRESENT
A REAL THREAT TO THE UNITED
STATES, AND THAT THE
INTERROGATIONS HERE HAVE
ELICITED VITAL INFORMATION
AND CONTINUE TO DO SO.
FOR INSTANCE, THIS CHART
FROM A BRIEFING WE GOT TODAY
OUTLINES THE AL QAEDA BOMBMAKERS
OFFICIALS SAY ARE HERE
AT THE CAMP, 15 OF THEM.
OFFICIALS SAY ROADSIDE BOMBS
FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN ARE
ACTUALLY BROUGHT HERE
TO GUANTANAMO WHERE DETAINEES
ARE ASKED ABOUT THEIR DESIGNS
AND WHO MIGHT HAVE HELPED MAKE
THEM.
ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING GOOD
ANYMORE?
IS THERE STILL POINT
IN INTERROGATING THESE PEOPLE?
>> YEAH.
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHO'S STILL
OUT THERE.
THEY KNOW HOW THEY DO BUSINESS.
>> Reporter: FOR PAUL RESTER
AND MANY AMERICANS HERE
AT GUANTANAMO BAY, GETTING THAT
INFORMATION IS TOUGH BUSINESS.
BUT WORTH IT.
>> THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE OUGHT
TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS.
THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES
TO BE AT RISK.
IF IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE
AWARE OF IT, THEN MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT THOSE OF US WHO ARE DOING
THIS REALLY WANT.
I AM NOT ANY WAY DISAPPOINTED
WHEN I GO HOME AND MY NEIGHBOR
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE GUANTANAMO IS
AND NEVER HEARD OF A WAR,
BECAUSE THAT'S OUR JOB, TO KEEP
THEM SAFE.
>> TERRY MOREN REPORTING
ON AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK
AT GUANTANAMO BAY AND ASKING
TOUGH QUESTIONS.
>> ABC NEWS HAS A NEW POLL OUT
ON THIS. MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE
SUSPECTS SHOULD BE TAKEN
TO GUANTANAMO BAY BUT A WHOPPING
70% DON'T BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE
HELD WITHOUT CHARGES.

TO BRING A DARKNESS AND APPEAL

HOWEVER THEY'RE SAYING NOT QUITE

BUT GOOD STUFF THERE.

WITH THIS BUDGET AT STAKE.
>> WE HAVE TO SEE.
THEY SAID 157 MINUTES IS

IF YOU GO TO THE THEATER.

THAT'S TWO HOURS AND 37 MINUTES.

THE WHOLE THING OFF.
THEY HAVE REVAMPED IT,
AND THE ANAMATRONICS OF JOHNNY

VERY SERIOUSLY HERE'S DIANE

OUT TO SEA FOR YEARS AT A TIME,
CATCHING WHALES, TURNING
THEIR BLUBBER INTO 90,000
GALLONS OF OIL TO BRING BACK
HOME.
IS IT POSSIBLE SOME OF THEM ARE
STILL ON BOARD THE SHIP
IN MYSTIC SEA PORT?
>> THE RHODE ISLAND PARANORMAL
RESEARCH GROUP WROTE US A LETTER
IN FEBRUARY AND ASKED TO COME
AND DO A PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATION OF THE PARANORMAL
ACTIVITY ABOARD THE MORGAN THREE
VISITORS DESCRIBED THE SAME TYPE
OF INCIDENT.
THEY MENTIONED SEEING SOMEBODY
IN THE BLUBBER ROOM, MID-LEVEL
OF THE SHIP, DRESSED IN 19th
CENTURY CLOTHING, A GENTLEMAN
WORKING WITH SOME LINE AND WAS
SMOKING A PIPE.
>> Reporter: ONE OF THOSE
WITH A STORY TO TELL IS HOWARD
DAVIS, A LONG-TIME MYSTIC SEA
PORT EMPLOYEE.

LUNCH MATE WAS A SHIP KEEPER
ON THE CHARLES MORGAN.
>> ONE NIGHT IN THE WINTER I WAS
DOWN THERE, PUTTING OUT
THE LIGHTS, AND I HAD THIS
FEELING THAT THIS FELLA WAS --
WHO I HAD KNOWN, WAS STANDING
RIGHT BEHIND ME.
SO I TURNED AROUND QUICK,
AND THERE WAS NOBODY THERE.
>> Reporter: HOWARD IS PRETTY
SURE IT WASN'T HIS LUNCH BUDDY,
WHO DIED YEARS AGO.
>> RECENTLY THE YOUNG BOY WAS

A PIPE, DIDN'T HE?

EVIDENCE THAT BROUGHT THEM BACK
FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THIS
TIME WITH A HEAVY ARTILLERY.
ANDREW IS THE FOUNDER
OF THE RHODE ISLAND PARANORMAL
RESEARCH GROUP, AND HE CLAIMS
TO HAVE SEEN TWO GHOSTS
IN HIS LIFETIME.
ONE OF THEM ABOARD THIS VERY
SHIP.
SO THEY SET UP INFRARED CAMERAS
AND MICROPHONES, COMBING
THE SHIP WITH SMALL
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD DETECTORS
THEY SAY MEASURING PARANORMAL
ACTIVITY BY PICKING UP
ON STRANGE ENERGY IN THE AIR.
THE NEXT STEP, WHAT THEY CALL
A SIT-DOWN, NOT A SEANCE, WHICH
SUMMONS THE SPIRITS, THIS JUST
TRIES TO SEE IF THE SPIRITS ARE
ACTUALLY PRESENT.
AFTER A LONG NIGHT OF WAITING,
HOURS OF FOOTAGE, OUR CAMERAS
DIDN'T PICK UP ANY OF THE GHOSTS
ON BOARD.
BUT THEY CLAIM TO HAVE HAD A LOT
OF PSYCHIC CONTACT.
>> WE TALKED TO A COUPLE OF MEN.
AND A THIRD MAN THAT WE DID TRY
TO SPEAK WITH, BUT HE WAS
FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.
SO WE COULDN'T COMMUNICATE.
>> IT'S UP TO YOU AND WHAT
YOU BELIEVE.
IF WE GET SOME PEOPLE ON BOARD
THAT ARE LOOKING FOR A GHOST
AND THEY LEAVE LEARNING THAT
WHALE OIL FUELED THE INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION AND THAT THESE GUYS
SPENT ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO FIVE
YEARS OF THEIR LIFE ON THIS
VESSEL, THEN WE'RE DOING OKAY.
>> DO I THINK IT'S HAUNTED?
YES, I WOULD SAY THE BOAT
HAUNTED, BUT TO WHAT LEVEL,
WE STILL HAVE TO FIND OUT.
>> THE GHOSTS AREN'T DUMB.
THEY KNOW THE CAMERAS ARE THERE.
THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T COME OUT.
>> CAMERA CONSCIOUS.
>>> AS ARE WE.
WHEN WE COME BACK WARREN BUFFETT
EXPLAINS HIS DECISION TO GIVE
AWAY THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE.
>>> BILLIONAIRE WARREN BUFFETT
RARELY SPEAKS BEFORE CAMERAS,
SO IT CAME AS A BIT
OF A SURPRISE WHEN HE AGREED
TO HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE
ABOUT HIS DECISION TO GIVE AWAY
85% OF HIS FORTUNE TO CHARITY.
A CHARITY RUN BY THE ONLY MAN
IN THE WORLD WEALTHIER THAN
BUFFETT HIMSELF.
HERE'S WARREN BUFFETT, MICROSOFT
FOUNDER BILL GATES AND HIS WIFE
MELINDA IN THEIR OWN WORDS.
>> MY ORIGINAL THOUGHT, IT WAS
A THOUGHT THAT WAS DEVELOPED
WITH MY WIFE 50 YEARS AGO, WAS
THAT I WOULD ACCUMULATE IT
THROUGH MY LIFETIME.
AND I THOUGHT THE ODDS WERE GOOD
THAT SHE WOULD SURVIVE ME
AND THAT WE ALWAYS AGREED IT
WOULD ALL GO BACK TO SOCIETY,
BUT WE THOUGHT THE ODDS WERE
GOOD THAT SHE WOULD BE THE ONE
THAT IMPLEMENTED THAT.
BUT SHE DIED BEFORE I DID,
SO I THEN WAS FACED EITHER
WITH THE CHOICE OF LETTING IT
RUN TILL THE END OF MY LIFE
OR DOING SOMETHING CURRENTLY.
SINCE I HAVE A SENSATIONAL
SOLUTION FOR DOING IT NOW,
BETTER THAN ANYTHING I COULD
HAVE IMAGINED, I HAVE SELECTED
THESE FIVE FOUNDATIONS, ALL
OF WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN
STRENGTHS, TO IMPLEMENT THIS.
IF YOU'RE ACCUMULATING WEALTH,
IT'S VERY NATURAL,
OR IF YOU WISH TO ACCUMULATE
WEALTH, TO GO TO SOMEBODY
YOU THINK CAN HANDLE MONEY
BETTER THAN YOU CAN,
AN INVESTMENT MANAGER, WHOMEVER
IT MAY BE, AND TURN YOUR MONEY
OVER TO THEM AND SAY, YOU CAN DO
A BETTER JOB THAN I CAN DO, MAKE
ME SOME MONEY I HAVE PEOPLE
SAYING, YOU CAN GIVE IT AWAY
BETTER THAN I CAN, SO I'M
TURNING IT OVER TO YOU,
AND YOU DO A BETTER JOB
OF GIVING IT AWAY THAN I WOULD.
>> BILL AND I ARE ABSOLUTELY
HONORED AND HUMBLED BY WARREN'S
GIFT.
IT'S REALLY UNPRECEDENTED
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO DO
GOOD IN THE WORLD.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY
SERIOUSLY.
WE HAVE -- FEEL INCREDIBLE
RESPONSIBILITY.
I THINK WHEN YOU GIVE AWAY
YOUR OWN WEALTH, IT'S ONE THING.
BUT TO GIVE AWAY THE BODY
OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE'S WORK
IS QUITE SOMETHING.
IT'S SOMETHING WE LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH WARREN
ON AS A TRUSTEE.
WE HAVE A GREAT MANAGEMENT TEAM
IN PLACE IN THE FOUNDATION.
WE'LL HAVE TO EXPAND THAT
SOMEWHAT AND GROW THE FOUNDATION
A BIT OVER TIME.
I THINK WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT
FROM US IS WE'LL DEEPEN
THE AREAS WE'RE ALREADY INTO.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BROADEN
THE FOUNDATION IN A WHOLE LOT
OF AREAS BUT DEEPEN
OUR COMMITMENT TO TO GLOBAL
HEALTH AND PARTICULARLY
EDUCATION SO I KNOW BILL
AND I ARE DELIGHTED NOT ONLY
ABOUT THE GIFT BUT GETTING
TO WORK WITH WARREN.
WE'RE VERY, VERY EXCITED
ABOUT IT.
>> WE'VE KNOWN WARREN SINCE
1991.
IT WAS HIS THOUGHT THAT WEALTH
SHOULD GO BACK TO SOCIETY, THAT
GOT US THINKING ABOUT DOING
OUR FOUNDATION IN THE FIRST
PLACE.
AND SO IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE
FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS
MONEY GETS USED IN THE RIGHT
WAY, BUT ONE WE'RE THRILLED
ABOUT AND THRILLED THAT WE'LL
HAVE WARREN AS OUR THIRD
TRUSTEE.
YOU'RE SEEING THE THREE TRUSTEES
OF THE FOUNDATION HERE,
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST
JOB TO HAVE AS MUCH IMPACT
AS POSSIBLE.
WE THINK PHILANTHROPY IS
SOMETHING THAT IS A CHOICE THAT
PEOPLE MAKE, BUT WE WANT TO SHOW
PEOPLE THAT IT CAN BE A LOT
OF FUN AND IT CAN HAVE A LOT
OF IMPACT.
AND SO WE THINK, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER COUNTRY IT IS, WE'D
LIKE TO ENCOURAGE MORE
PHILANTHROPY.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN CREATING
DYNASTIC WEALTH.
MY CHILDREN HAVE ALL RECEIVED
MONEY FROM ME AND MY WIFE
THEY'LL RECEIVE MORE FROM ME
ON MY DEATH. THEY'RE
IN THE PRIVILEGED TOP 1%,
AT LEAST, OF THE POPULATION,
PERHAPS THE TOP TENTH OF 1%
EVEN, BUT I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT SOCIETY THAT ASPIRES --
THAT BELIEVES IN EQUALITY
OF OPPORTUNITY -- MY KIDS HAVE
HAD AN ADVANTAGE THAT OVER 99%
OF KIDS IN THE COUNTRY --
THE WHOLE COMBINATION OF THINGS,
EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T GIVEN
MONEY, THEY HAD A HUGE ADVANTAGE
I DON'T THINK IT'S IN KEEPING --
IT ISN'T IN KEEPING WITH MY VIEW
OF HOW THE WORLD SHOULD OPERATE
TO CREATE HUGE AMOUNTS
OF DYNASTIC WEALTH.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT, IN TERMS
OF HAVING EQUALITY
OF OPPORTUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY
AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE
IN THE RIGHT JOBS DOING
THE RIGHT THINGS, I DON'T THINK
THEY SHOULD INHERIT MY POSITION
IN SOCIETY ANY MORE THAN
IF I WAS ON THE OLYMPIC TEAM 20
YEARS AGO AT THE 100 METER DASH,
WHICH WOULD BE HARD FOR SOME
OF YOU TO IMAGINE, THAT
THEY SHOULD INHERIT MY POSITION
IN 2008, OR IF I WAS QUARTERBACK
OF THE NEBRASKA FOOTBALL TEAM 60
YEARS AGO, WHICH AGAIN IS HARD
TO IMAGINE.
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN INHERITING
YOUR POSITION IN SOCIETY BASED
ON WHAT WOMB YOU COME FROM.
THEY DIDN'T DO -- WELL, THEY DID
A FEW THINGS WRONG.
THEY DID FEWER THINGS WRONG THAN
I DID AT THEIR AGE, I'LL PUT IT
THAT WAY.
I'M ENORMOUSLY PROUD OF THEM.
THEY'LL HAVE THE EQUIVALENT
OF A BILLION DOLLAR FOUNDATION
EACH.
I HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY HAVE DONE
IN THE PHILANTHROPIC ARENA BOTH
IN TERMS OF THE -- WHAT THEY'VE
GOTTEN INVOLVED IN AND HOW
THEY GOT INVOLVED IN IT,
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD.
>> YEAH.

TO LEAVE TOO MUCH MONEY
TO HIS CHILDREN, BUT IT ALSO
SEEMS IT'S OFTEN IN THE WAY
YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN.
THIS IS A PERSON WHO LIVES
A VERY UNASSUMING LIFE, BUYS
HIS SUITS OFF THE RACK, LIVES
IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA, SO THAT HAS
AN IMPACT AS WELL IN TERMS
OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR MONEY
IN THEIR LIVES.
>> WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS
BEFORE WITH BILL GATES.
HE'S REALLY MADE THAT PART
OF THE CULTURE AT MICROSOFT,
TOO.
SO MANY OF THEM WHO LEFT
AND CASHED OUT WITH STOCK
OPTIONS HAVE STARTED CHARITABLE
FOUNDATIONS SO IT'S PART
OF THE CULTURE THERE.
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK
IN A MOMENT, GOOD NEWS
FOR COFFEE LOVERS, INCLUDING US.
>> YOU'LL LOVE THE NEWS.
>>> WELCOME BACK HERE, EVERYONE.
COFFEE, MORE THAN 80% OF ADULTS
IN THIS COUNTRY START THE DAY
WITH IT, AND IT SEEMS ALMOST
EVERY OTHER MONTH THERE'S A NEW
STUDY SUGGESTING IT'S GOOD
FOR YOU, THAT IT'S BAD FOR YOU,
THEN GOOD FOR YOU AGAIN.
THIS MORNING WE'VE GOT MORE GOOD
COFFEE NEWS, INTRIGUING EVIDENCE
THAT COFFEE CAN CUT YOUR RISK
OF TYPE II DIABETES.
HERE'S JOHN McKENZIE.
>> Reporter: ON ANY GIVEN
MORNING, MORE THAN 100 MILLION
AMERICANS REACH FOR A CUP
OF COFFEE TO JUMP-START
THEIR DAY.
MANY ADMIT THEY'RE HOOKED.
>> I GUESS I'M ADDICTED
TO CAFFEINE.
I LIKE THE TASTE.
>> I HAVE TO HAVE IT EVERY
MORNING.
>> Reporter: WHY?
>> WHY?
IT WAKES ME UP.
>> IF I DON'T HAVE COFFEE, I'M
REALLY TIRED, AND IRRITABLE,
AND CRANKY.
>> Reporter: BUT MOUNTING
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS ALL THOSE
LATTES AND CAPPUCCINOS MIGHT NOT
ONLY IMPROVE YOUR MOOD,
THEY JUST MIGHT IMPROVE
YOUR HEALTH.
DAILY CUPS OF COFFEE HAVE BEEN
LINKED TO A REDUCED RISK
OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE, LIVER
CANCER, GALLSTONES,
AND ESPECIALLY TYPE 2 DIABETES.
A VARIETY OF STUDIES NOW SHOWS
THAT FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE A DAY,
AND THESE ARE STANDARD CUPS,
EIGHT OUNCES IN EACH, IS
ASSOCIATED WITH A 30% REDUCTION
IN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING
DIABETES.
AND THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS
THE MORE COFFEE YOU DRINK,
THE GREATER THE PROTECTION.
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE
TO GET WIRED.
THE STUDY OUT TODAY FOUND DECAF
JUST AS EFFECTIVE AGAINST
DIABETES AS REGULAR, CAFFEINATED
COFFEE.
BOTH ARE LOADED WITH THE SAME
NUTRIENTS, AND AS RESEARCHERS
HAVE DISCOVERED, MUCH MORE.
>> THERE ARE COMPOUNDS IN COFFEE
WHICH, WHEN GIVEN TO A RAT,
ENHANCED THE CAPACITY
OF ITS LIVER TO BURN SUGAR, MUCH
LIKE ANTI-DIABETIC MEDICATIONS.
>> Reporter: INTRIGUING
RESEARCH, SAY DOCTORS.
BUT STILL TOO PRELIMINARY
TO ACTUALLY PRESCRIBE A COUPLE
DOUBLE ESPRESSOS A DAY.
>> I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE
PEOPLE GO OUT AND START DRINKING
COFFEE IN THE HOPE THEY'RE GOING
TO DECREASE THEIR RISK
FOR DIABETES.
>> Reporter: BUT FOR THOSE
ALREADY DOWNING THEIR DAILY CUPS
OF JAVA, EVEN A POSSIBLE HEALTH
BENEFIT IS JUST ONE MORE THING
TO SAVOR.
JOHN McKENZIE, ABC NEWS, NEW
YORK.
>> THAT SEEMS THE MOST
INTERESTING THING IT'S NOT
THE CAFFEINE.
ALL THE TIME YOU THOUGHT THAT
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE JOLT, WELL,
YOU DON'T NEED THE JOLT TO GET
THE BENEFITS, BUT IT WON'T HURT
>> IF THEY WOULD ONLY COME OUT
WITH A STUDY ON MARGARITAS
TO SAY THE SAME THING, I WOULD
BE DISEASE-FREE.
>> HOW MANY OF THOSE A DAY DO
YOU HAVE?
>> KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF.
>>> THAT'S THE NEWS FOR THIS
HALF HOUR.
COMING UP, MORE NEWS FROM ABC.

THIS ISN'T JUST FOR THIS YEAR,
BUT YEARS TO COME THANKS

3,500 SOLDIERS FROM THE 82nd

ANOTHER 3,500 SOLDIERS

IN FT.
HOOD, TEXAS, HAVE BEEN TOLD
THEY'LL LIKELY BE GOING
TO KUWAIT INSTEAD IT'S PART
OF THE PLAN GENERAL GEORGE CASEY
PRESENTED TO PRESIDENT BUSH LAST
WEEK.
PENTAGON SOURCES SAY CASEY TOLD
THE PRESIDENT THAT IF CONDITIONS
IMPROVE, THERE COULD BE DEEPER
CUTS NEXT YEAR.
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF COMBAT
TROOPS IN IRAQ BY ABOUT HALF.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS GENERAL
CASEY ASSURED ME OF IS WHATEVER
RECOMMENDATION HE MAKES, IT WILL
BE AIMED TOWARD ACHIEVING
VICTORY.
>> Reporter: BUT SENATE
DEMOCRATS WERE FURIOUS, SAYING
GENERAL CASEY'S PLAN IS
VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO ONE
THEY PROPOSED AND WERE LOUDLY
CRITICIZED FOR JUST LAST WEEK.
>> WE WERE CONDEMNED AND WE WERE
SAID TO BE CUTTING AND RUNNING
FROM OUR TROOPS AND
OUR RESPONSIBILITY.
>> Reporter: THE PENTAGON HAS
PLANNED FOR DEEP TROOP
REDUCTIONS IN THE PAST, ONLY
TO SCRAP THOSE PLANS
BECAUSE OF PERSISTENT VIOLENCE.
SOMETHING THAT COULD DERAIL
THESE PLANS AS WELL.
JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS,

ITS DECISION TO PUBLISH DETAILS
OF AN ANTI-TERROR PROGRAM THAT

IN A LETTER ON ITS WEBSITE, "THE
TIMES" SAYS PUBLIC INTEREST
OUTWEIGHED CONCERNS
ABOUT COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS.
PRESIDENT BUSH HAD HARSH WORDS
FOR THE PAPERS WHICH CHOSE
TO PUBLISH THE STORY.
>> THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS
PROGRAM IS DISGRACEFUL.
WE'RE AT WAR WITH A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HURT
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
AND FOR PEOPLE TO LEAK THAT
PROGRAM AND FOR A NEWSPAPER
TO PUBLISH IT DOES GREAT HARM
TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
WHAT WE'RE DOING WAS THE RIGHT
THING.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID
THE PRINTING OF THE STORY BREAKS
A LONG-TIME TRADITION OF KEEPING
WARTIME SECRETS.
>>> THE SUPREME COURT IS READY
TO TAKE ON THE CONTROVERSIAL
ISSUE OF GLOBAL WARMING THE HIGH
COURT AGREED TO CONSIDER WHETHER
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MUST
REGULATE CARBON DIOXIDE TO FIGHT
GLOBAL WARMING.
A NUMBER OF STATES, CITIES,
AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS PUSHED
THE COURT TO TAKE THE CASE.
AND THE COURT ALSO STRUCK DOWN
VERMONT'S CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS,
CONSIDERED THE TOUGHEST
IN THE NATION.
THE RULING STATED THAT VERMONT'S
LIMITS TO CAMPAIGN SPENDING ARE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE
THEY VIOLATE THE FIRST
AMENDMENT.
>>> "NEWS NOTES," THE SENATE IS
EXPECTED TO VOTE ON

RICHEST MEN GOT TOGETHER
YESTERDAY TO TALK
ABOUT THEIR AMAZING NEW
PARTNERSHIP.
BILL GATES AND HIS WIFE MELINDA

BUFFETT'S $30 BILLION DONATION
TO THEIR FOUNDATION.
THE MONEY WILL DOUBLE
THE FOUNDATION'S ENDOWMENT
AND WILL GO TOWARD FIGHTING
DISEASE AND IMPROVING EDUCATION
ANOTHER RICH MAN'S NAME WAS
BROUGHT INTO THE MIX, TED
TURNER.
HE SAID WHEN TED GAVE A LARGE
SUM OF MONEY, HE TRIED TO SHAME
PEOPLE INTO DOING THE SAME.
BILL GATES SAID HE'S TAKING
A DIFFERENT APPROACH.
>> INTERESTING.
IT'S STILL VERY EXPENSIVE,
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT
TO COMBAT MALARIA, A VACCINE
AND DISTRIBUTING THAT VACCINE
WILL COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY
BUT EVERYTHING IS VERY EXPENSIVE
THESE DAYS IN TERMS
OF ACCOMPLISHING THE GOAL.
>> YOU THINK THIS IS A PRETTY
GOOD START, $60 BILLION.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>>> COMING UP HERE ON "WORLD
NEWS NOW," A NEW LOOK
AT WIMBLEDON AS THE TRADITIONAL
UNIFORMS AT CENTRE COURT HAVE
BEEN REPLACED BY A NEW AMERICAN
STYLE FASHION STATEMENT.
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT.

AS THE MEN.
>>> AND OUT OF CONTROL, WHAT DO
YOU DO WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE
REALLY LOSING IT?
>>> IN THIS MAKEOVER CRAZE
CULTURE, IS ANYONE OR ANYTHING
SACRED?
APPARENTLY NOT.
EVEN ENGLAND'S OLDEST AND MOST
ESTEEMED TENNIS TOURNAMENT IS
UPDATING ITS LOOK WITH THE HELP
OF A MAJOR AMERICAN DESIGNER.
IN THIS "NIGHTLINE PLAYBACK"
SEGMENT, NICK WATT MAKES SPORT
OF THE BIGGEST FASHION NEWS
TO HIT TENNIS.
>> Reporter: THIS IS CENTRE
COURT AT WIMBLEDON, ARGUABLY
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PIECES
OF TURF ON EARTH.
AND IT'S THE EPICENTER
OF UNDERSTATED ENGLISH ELEGANCE.
THE PLAYERS WEAR WHITE,
THE SPECTATORS EAT STRAWBERRIES
AND CREAM THIS YEAR THERE'S
A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WHICH
IN THE HISTORY OF WIMBLEDON
AMOUNTS TO A REVOLUTION. THAT
WAS DAVID LAUREN, SON OF RALPH,
AND THIS IS WHAT WIMBLEDON BALL
BOYS AND GIRLS, LINE JUDGES
AND UMPIRES ARE WEARING THIS
SEASON.
>> THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST
EXCITING FASHION SHOW WE'VE EVER
HAD.
>> Reporter: RALPH LAUREN HAS
SIGNED A FIVE-YEAR DEAL
TO CLOTHE WIMBLEDON'S BIT PART
PLAYERS.
A BRIT LAST WON THE SINGLES BACK
IN 1936 AMERICANS HAVE WON 26
TITLES SINCE THEN.
AND NOW AN AMERICAN DESIGNER IS
TELLING THE BRITS HOW TO DRESS.
WELL, IT'S NOT QUITE THAT
SIMPLE.
AS ROGER FEDERER STRODE
ONTO THE COURT TO BEGIN
THE DEFENSE OF HIS TITLE.
>> VERY GOOD TO SEE THE NEW
OUTFITS.
THE BLUE LOOKS SMART
WITH THE WHITE PIPING ON THESE
BLAZERS.
>> Reporter: IT ALMOST COULD
HAVE BEEN THE 1930s WHEN
THE BRITS STILL HAD A CHANCE
RALPH LAUREN'S STYLE IS BASED
PRETTY MUCH ON --
>> ON ENGLAND.
>> Reporter: AND THAT'S EAST
COAST COUNTRY CLUB STYLE.
>> YEAH.
BUT IT ALL REALLY STARTS,
YOU KNOW, RIGHT HERE IN LONDON
AND THE SHIRES, THE STATELY
HOME.
IT'S TOTALLY AND UTTERLY BRITISH
TO THE CORE.
>> Reporter: BUT RALPH LAUREN IS
SPORTING THAT BACK TO US.
>> NEW CASTLE.
>> Reporter: CAR PARKED
IN DETROIT AS THEY SAY THERE.
>> IS THAT WHAT THEY SAY?
>> Reporter: FOR YEARS WIMBLEDON
OFFICIALS WORE ILL-FITTING GREEN
AND PURPLE.
DESIGNER UNKNOWN.
>> THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT COLORS
TO WEAR.
THEY'RE KIND OF -- THEY'RE SORT
OF SOGGY, WEIGH YOU DOWN.
THEY DON'T LOOK CRISP.
>> Reporter: DRAIN THE COLOR
FROM YOUR FACE?
>> TOTALLY.
AND THEY DON'T LOOK THAT SMART.
>> Reporter: WHEREAS DARK BLUE
WITH THE WHITE CONTRAST CAN SUIT
ANY COLORING.
>> SUITS ANYBODY.
AND INSTANTLY IT LOOKS
AUTHORITATIVE.
>> Reporter: A GOOD CHANGE?
>> OF COURSE I THINK A BIT
OF FASHION DOES GOOD.
TO THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB.
>> Reporter: COUNT HOW MANY
TIMES THE LINE JUDGES CALL
THEIR NEW OUTFITS LOVELY.
>> I THINK IT'S LOVELY.
IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE A CHANGE
FROM THE OLD UNIFORM.
>> IT'S LOVELY.
IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE.
THE FIRST THING IS -- THAT
STRIKES YOU WHEN YOU TOUCH IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT FEELS --
OH, IT'S LIKE CREAM
IN YOUR HANDS.
>> WE HAVE TO TRY TO KEEP
OUR EYES ON THE COURT AND NOT
ON THE LINESMEN.
>> Reporter: DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO LOOK
AT THE LOVELY BLAZER THE UMPIRE
IS WEARING OTHER THAN
CONCENTRATE?
>> I THINK I CAN KEEP MY EYES
TO THE BALL, YES.
>> Reporter: THE OFFICIALS ENJOY
THEIR MAKEOVER, THE PLAYERS HAVE
BEEN WARNED FOR THE UMPTEENTH
TIME, APPEAR ON COURT DRESSED
IN A MANNER DEEMED UNSUITABLE
BY THE COMMITTEE, AND YOU'RE
OUT.
>> TENNIS NEEDS A LITTLE BIT
OF A LIFT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.
I THINK IT'S QUITE NICE TO SEE
A BIT OF TAN CLEAVAGE.
IT'S QUITE CUTE TO SEE FRILLY
KNICKERS.
WE SAW THEM IN THE '20s
AND '30s.
I DON'T THINK THAT HURT, AS LONG
AS IT'S WHITE.
>> Reporter: ANDRE AGASSI
BOYCOTTED WIMBLEDON FOR THREE
YEARS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T BEAR
TO DITCH THE GARISH THREADS.
HE EVENTUALLY CAVED IN AND WON
HERE IN '92, WEARING ALL WHITE,
BUT HE STILL LOOKED LIKE FARRAH
FAWCETT FROM THE NECK UP.
>> THE INTERESTING THING
WITH WIMBLEDON IS THE BALANCE
BETWEEN TRADITION
AND INNOVATION.
AND I THINK IF WE SAY WE'LL STAY
WITH TRADITION FOR THE SAKE
OF IT, WE'LL FALL BEHIND.
WE'LL BE OLD FASHIONED.
>> Reporter: YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GO TO ARTIFICIAL GRASS?
>> NO, THERE ARE SOME THINGS
SACROSANCT >> Reporter: UMPIRES'
UNIFORMS AREN'T SACROSANCT.
AND NEITHER ARE THE REGULAR RAIN
DELAYS.
>> WHAT A PITY THIS IS.
>> Reporter: THEY'RE BUILDING
A ROOF OVER CENTRE COURT THAT
WILL BE READY IN TIME
FOR WIMBLEDON 2009. THERE'S BEEN
A DROUGHT HERE IN THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT THIS MORNING
AS THE TOURNAMENT BEGAN, IT
POURED.
FOR "NIGHTLINE," NICK WATTS
AT WIMBLEDON.
>> NOW WE HOPE THE COLORS DON'T
RUN IN THAT RAIN, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I'M SURPRISED THEY ALLOWED
THE LOGOS TO BE THAT BIG.
>> THAT WAS SORT OF A SURPRISE
IT IS AN INTERESTING CHANGE.
EVEN PETER WAS SOUNDING
ON OF HERE, OUR FASHION PLATE.
>> EVERYONE'S GOT AN OPINION.
>> DOESN'T LIKE THE WHITE
PIPING.
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, MORE NEWS
COMING UP HERE.
>>> WELCOME BACK.
I'M SONYA CRAWFORD

TIME FOR OVERSEAS NEWS,
AND FOR THAT WE TURN TO DECLAN
CURRY OF THE BBC IN LONDON, WHO
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO RENAME
OUR WORLD CUP CORRESPONDENT,
RIGHT, DECLAN?
>> Reporter: I'M HOPING THAT
SOMEONE BETTER WILL COME ALONG
WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT SOCCER
TO TALK ABOUT THE WORLD CUP
FOR YOU.
THAT MIGHT MAKE AN IMPROVEMENT
IN THE COVERAGE.
I SPENT THE WEEKEND WITH SOME
FRIENDS OF MINE FROM AUSTRALIA,
WHO HAVE COME OVER ON VACATION.
THEY WERE PARTICULARLY KEEN THAT
THEY SPENT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
WATCHING SOCCER BECAUSE
AUSTRALIA WAS PLAYING ITALY
AND THEY THOUGHT AUSTRALIA, WHO
MANY OF US DIDN'T KNOW HAD
A SOCCER TEAM, MIGHT GET
THROUGH TO THE FAR REACHES
OF THE WORLD CUP.
BAD NEWS FOR THEM.
HA, HA, HA.
THIS IS ONE OF THE FRONT PAGES
FROM ONE OF THE TABLOID
NEWSPAPERS HERE IN LONDON THIS
MORNING.
THE HEADLINE SAYS IT ALL,
THE AUSTRALIANS KNOCKED OUT
IN SOME CONTROVERSY, THIS ONE.
BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY LATE
PENALTY BY THE ITALIANS THAT LED
TO THEIR VICTORY OVER AUSTRALIA.
THE AUSTRALIANS THINKING THERE
WAS A LITTLE UNFAIR PLAY
INVOLVED IN THIS.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT A PROPER
SPORT?
LET'S TALK ABOUT TENNIS, SHALL
WE?
WIMBLEDON.
THE GREAT ENGLISH TRADITION
OF WIMBLEDON STARTED YESTERDAY
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
IT STARTED TO RAIN.
AFTER WEEKS AND WEEKS OF BRIGHT,
BAKING SUNSHINE AND WARM
WEATHER, AS SOON AS THE TENNIS
STARTS IN LONDON, THE CLOUDS
OPENED AND THEY GOT
APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES' WORTH
OF PLAY OUT OF THE ENTIRE DAY
YESTERDAY.
WHAT DO TENNIS PLAYERS DO
NOWADAYS WHENEVER THEY'RE RAINED
OFF AND THEY CAN'T KNOCK
THE BALLS ABOUT ON THE COURT?
THEY SIT DOWN AND LOG
ON TO THE INTERNET AND WRITE
THEIR OWN BLOGS.
THIS IS THE TIMES OF LONDON
SHOWING THE BALL BOYS AND GIRLS
BRINGING THE COVERS ACROSS
THE COURT ONCE THE RAIN STARTS.
OVER HERE YOU GET EXCERPTS
FROM A NUMBER OF THE BLOGS
FROM THE PLAYERS, INCLUDING
THE BRITISH HOPEFUL ANDY MURRAY,
THE ONE THE BRITS ARE PUTTING
ALL THEIR MONEY ON THIS YEAR
AFTER MANY, MANY YEARS
OF BACKING TIM HENMAN
AND GETTING NOWHERE.
HE SAID HE SPENT HIS TIME
WATCHING "BIG BROTHER."
>> YOU'VE DONE A CREDIBLE JOB
AS OUR SPORTS CORRESPONDENT THIS
MORNING.
BRIEFLY, YOU SAID YOU HAD SAD
NEWS OUT OF GERMANY THIS
MORNING?
>> Reporter: SAD NEWS
ABOUT THE RUNAWAY BEAR.
THIS IS THE BEAR'S TRAVELS WE'VE
BEEN FOLLOWING.
HE'S BEEN WANDERING AROUND
SOUTHERN GERMANY FOR SEVEN
WEEKS.
LOCAL OFFICIALS THOUGHT HE WAS
LIVELY AND THEN GOT MORE
CONCERNED AS HE ATE MORE LOCAL
SHEEP AND BIRDS AND THINGS.
THE NEWS IS HE WAS SHOT
YESTERDAY.
HE WAS TRACKED DOWN FINALLY
BY THE GERMAN HUNTERS
AND BY THE SPECIAL DOGS BROUGHT
DOWN FROM FINLAND TO TRACK HIM
DOWN.
THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ARE
REFUSING TO REVEAL THE NAME
OF THE HUNTER WHO FIRED
THE BULLET BECAUSE THEY'RE
CONCERNED THEY MAY GET DEATH
THREATS OF THEIR OWN.
>> HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET ANY
HATE MAIL FROM THE LOVERS
OF THAT BEAR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DECLAN CURRY AT THE BBC
IN LONDON FOR JOINING US.
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, SONYA.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
>>> ONE MORE NOTE FROM THE UK
THIS MORNING, DETAILS OF PRINCE
CHARLES' FINANCES WERE RELEASED
YESTERDAY, AND THE HEIR
TO THE THRONE'S INCOME WAS UP 6%
THIS YEAR TO $25 MILLION.
OF THAT SUM, HE SPENT NEARLY $12
MILLION ON OFFICIAL DUTIES
AND CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES, CLOSE
TO $6 MILLION IN TAXES, AND CLES
TO $8 MILLION ON HIS 105 STAFF
MEMBERS.
HIS OFFICE SAYS THE PRINCE WORKS
HARD AND HIS LIFESTYLE IS
BY NO MEANS EXTRAVAGANT.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE RAISED
$200 MILLION FOR CHARITY.
THAT'S IT FOR THIS SEGMENT.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN THE NEXT BREAK.

IT DOESN'T CHANGE, THAT'S
THE THING.
>>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S START OFF
HERE WITH J.K. ROWLING,
THE AUTHOR OF THE HARRY POTTER
BOOKS IN BRITAIN IS NOW SAYING
THAT SHE MAY, IN FACT, IN THE
SEVENTH
BOOK KILL OFF A COUPLE
CHARACTERS.
SHE SAYS THESE ARE TWO
CHARACTERS SHE HADN'T INTENDED
TO KILL OFF.
THERE'S SOME SPECULATION IT MAY
BE HARRY POTTER.
BUT SHE ISN'T SAYING.
>> SHE SAYS WE'RE DEALING
WITH PURE EVIL.
PURE EVIL WON'T GO AFTER EXTRAS
BUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS SHE SAID
SHE ACTUALLY WROTE THE ENDING
ALREADY, SEVEN YEARS AGO, BEFORE
THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED.
WE'LL SEE HOW THE BOOK GOES.
>> SHE WROTE THE LAST CHAPTER
OF THE SEVENTH BOOK IN 1990.
EVERYONE'S THINKING, WHY DID
YOU WRITE THE LAST CHAPTER FIRST
AND WORK BACKWARDS?
IT'S INTERESTING, I HADN'T
REALIZED THIS, AUTHORS SOMETIMES
LIKE TO KILL OFF THEIR
CHARACTERS BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE
THEY DON'T WANT NON-AUTHORS
TO WRITE SEQUELS.
>> YOU WOULD THINK
WITH COPYRIGHT LAWS SHE COULD
PREVENT THIS, BUT SHE SAYS IT'S
PART --
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A REALISTIC
TALE OF MAGIC.
A LOT OF THE KIDS WHO GREW UP
WITH HER BOOKS ARE GETTING OLDER
AND PERHAPS ARE MORE ABLE
TO HANDLE THIS.
>> SHE'S THE RICHEST WOMAN
IN ENGLAND, WORTH MORE THAN
THE QUEEN HERSELF.
>> SHE CAN DO WHATEVER
SHE WANTS.
>> EXACTLY.

ASSAULT, CIVIL BATTERY, GOES

CRIMINAL CHARGES IN THE UNITED
STATES.
SHE COULD FACE SEVEN YEARS
IN PRISON AND DEPORTATION.
NOT A VERY HAPPY HOUSEHOLD.
>> THE NEWS OF THIS LATEST

AGAINST HER COMES TODAY OR CAME
YESTERDAY, AND TODAY SHE'S DUE
IN COURT ON THE OTHER CHARGES.

LEAVES IN CENTRAL PARK,
SERIOUSLY. HE WANTED TO DO
AN HIV/AIDS CHARITABLE
FOUNDATION AND THE JUDGE
REJECTED THAT.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING
TO END UP DOING COMMUNITY

IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE GROUND IS
SATURATED.
IN GEORGIA, A ROOF COLLAPSE.

WASHINGTON THIS MORNING, THANK
YOU FOR THAT. 
THREE MORE U.S. TROOPS ARE THE
LATEST VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE IN 
IRAQ. 
TWO MARINES WERE KILLED WHILE 
FIGHTING IN THE AL ANBAR
PROVINCE. 
AND A SOLDIER ON COMBAT PATROL
DIED AFTER A ROADSIDBOMB SOUTH
OF BAGHDAD. 
--XPLODE SOUTH OF BAGHDAD.
AND WE ARE LEARNING MORE DETAILS
THIS MORNING ABOUT A PLAN TO
BRING U.S. TROPPS HOME, SOME AS 
EARLY AS THIS FALL. 
HERE'S OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL.
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A
DRAWDOWN. 
3500 SOLDIERS FROM THE 82ND 
AIRBORNE DIVISION IN FORT BRAGG,
NORTH CAROLINA WHO WERE 
SCHEDULED TO LEAVE LATER THIS 
SUMMER HAVE NOW BEEN TOLD 
THEY'LL PROBABLY STAY HOME. 
ANOTHER 3,500 SOLDIERS FROM THE 
FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION IN FORT
HOOD, TEXAS HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY 
WILL LIKELY BE GOING TO KUWAIT
INSTD.
IT'S PART OF THE PLAN GENERAL 
GEORGE CASEY PRESENTED T 
PRESIDENT BUSH LAST WEEK. 
PENTAGON SOURCES SAY CASEY TOLD 
THE PRESIDENT IF CONDITIONS 
IMPROVE, THERE COULD BE DEEPER
CUTS NEXT YEAR, REDUCING THE
NUMBER OF COMBAT TROOPS IN IRAQ 
BY ABOUT HALF.
>> AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
GENERAL CASEY ASSURED ME OF IS
THAT WHATEVER RECOMMENDATION HE 
MAKES, IT WILL BE AIMED AT
ACHIEVING VICTORY.
>> BUT SENATE DEMOCRATS WERE
FURIOUS, SAYING GENERAL CASEY'S 
PLAN IS VIRTUALLIDEAL TO ONE
-- IDENTICAL TO ONE 
THEY PROPOSED AND WERE LOUDLY 
CRITICIZED FOR JUST LAST
WEEK. 
>> WE WERE CONDEMNED AND SAID TO
BE CUTTING AND RUNNING OUR
TROOPS AND FROM OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
>> THE PTAGON HAS PLANNED FOR 
DEEP TROOP REDUCTIONS IN THE
PAST ONLY TO SCRAP THOSE PLANS
BECAUSE OF PERSISTENT VIOLENCE, 
SOMETHING THAT COULD DERAIL 
THESE PLANS AS WELL.
JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS, THE
PENTAGON. 
>> TWO F-1FIGHTER JETS
COLLIDED ON MONDAY WHILE
PRACTICING DOGFIGHTING MOVES
OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.
ONE PILOT WAKILLED. 
THE OTHER MANAGED TO EJECT, 
ESCAPING WITH MINOR 
INJURIES. 
BOTH OFFICERS WERE MEMBERS OF A 
STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRON 125,
KNOWN AS THE "ROUGH RIDERS."
THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH IS UNDER 
INVESTIGATION.
TENSIONS ARE RISING BETWEEN 
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS IN THE
GAZA STRIP. 
MILITANTS FIRED THREE ROCKETS 
INTO SOUTHERN ISRAEL MONDAY 
NIGHT, WOUNDING ONE PERSON AND
KNOCKING OUT POWER IN ONE 
TOWN. 
THIS COMES AS ISRAEL IS BUILDING
ITS MILITARY FORCES ALONG THE
GAZA BORDER.
THE GOVERNMENT IS THREATENING A 
MAJOR OFFENSIVE IF A KIDNAPPED
SOLDIER IS NOT RELEASED.
THE LOS ANGELES TIMES THIS
MORNDING ITS
DECISION TO PUBLISH DETAILS OF A
SECRET ANTI-TERROR PROGRAM THAT 
TRACKS MONEY TRANSFERS. 
IN A LETTER ON ITS WEBSITE, THE 
TIMES SAYS PLIC INTEREST
OUTWEIGHED CONCERNS ABOUT 
COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS.
PRESIDENT BUSH HAD SOME HARSH 
WORDS FOR PAPER ACROSS THE
COUNTRY WHO PUBLISHED THE 
STORY.
>> THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS 
PROGRAM IS DISGRACEFUL. 
WE ARE AT WAR WITH A BUNCH OF 
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HARM THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND FOR
PEOPLE TO LEAK THAT PROGRAM AND 
FOR A NEWSPAPER TO PUBLISH IT 
ES GREAT HARM TO THE UNID 
STATES OF AMERICA.
WHAT WE WERE DOING W THE RIG
THING.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
PUBLICATION OF THE STORY
VIOLATES A LONGSTANDING 
AGREEMENT ABOUT PROTECTING
SECRETS DURING WARTIME. 
IT IS BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL 
AT A CALIFORNIA PORT THIS 
MORNING AFTER A TERRORIST THAT
SHUT IT DOWN FOR SEVERAL
HOURS.
A THREATENING 
DISCOVERED WRITTEN IN THE CARGO 
HOLD OF A SHIP. 
NO OTHER EVIDENCE WAS FOUND, BUT
STILL, THE F.B.I. AND SECRET
SERVICE ARE INVESTIGATING.
HALF A DOZEN WDFIRES ARE
BURNING NEAR RENO, NEVADA AND 
SOME HOMES ARE THREATENED BY ONE
OF THEM.
THE FLAMES AND SMOKE FORCED 
EVACUATIONS, CLOSED SOME
HIGHWAYS AND EVEN BURNED PART OF
THE TRAINING GROUNDS AT THE 
STATE FIRE ACADEMY. 
THE BIGGEST OF THE FIRES HAS
ALREADY SCORCH NEARLY 1,000 
ACRES.
NOW FOR TODAY'S WEATHER.
MUCH OF THE EAST COAST FROM THE 
CAROLINAS TO NEW YORK WILL GET
MORE HEAVY RAIN AND 
FLOODING. 
THE MIDWEST, GREAT LAKES AND
SOUTHWEST WILL ALSO HAVE
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.
MUCH OF THE NATION WILL HAVE
TEMPERURES BELOW NORMAL 
TODAY.
BUT THE WEST AND NORTHWEST WILL 
AGAIN BE VERY WARM WITH 
TEMPERATURES MORE THAN 10 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 
THAT'S THE NATIONAL OUTLOOK, NOW
HERE'S THE WEATHER WHERE YOU
ARE.
>> WHAT I'M NOT?
YEAH, I'M NOT A LOT OF THINGS.
I'M A GOOF.
I MAKE MESSES.
>> RACHAEL RAY MAKES THINGS
EASY.
>> I'M NOT A CHEF; I'M A COOK.
>> JUST BIPPITY BOP BOOM, AND
SHE GETS IT DONE.
>> I LIKE LAUGHING LOUD.
I LIKE COOKING AT MY HUSBAND'S
OR MY MOM'S.
I DON'T BAKE.
I'M VERY ADVENTUROUS.
I'LL TRY ANYTHING ONCE.
>> SHE'S REAL.
>> I'M NOT A PERFECTIONIST,
ALTHOUGH I'M A HARD WORKER.
I DIDN'T EVEN DRIVE UNTIL MY
MID-20s.
I'M LIKE--

>> TOMORROW MORNING, A
CELEBRATION 19 YEARS IN THE 
MAKING, OLD FRIENDS, SURPRISES, 
UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS.
TOMORROW, CHARLES GIBSON SAYS,
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA." 
>> WE RAISE OUR MUGS TO YOU.
>> YEAH.
>> TIME FOR A CHECK OF MARKET 
ACTIVITIES STARTING 
OVERSEAS.
>> WELL, ARE YOU HAVING A HARD
TIME KEEPING UP WITH WHO'S IN 
CHARGE AT MAJOR 
CORPORATIONS? 
YOU'RE NOT ALONE. 
JOINING US NOWROM WASHINGTON
TO TALK ABOUT C.E.O. TURNOVERS
IS PAUL KOCOUREK, SENIOR VICE 
PRESIDENT AT BOOZ ALLEN 
HAMILTON. 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> I KNOW YOU HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER
BROAD, SWEEPING LOOK AT C.E.O.'S
TURNOVERS AT MAJOR CORPORATIONS 
AROUND THE U.S., WHAT WAS MOST
STRIKING? 
>> ONE IS THAT THE LEVEL OF 
C.E.O. TURNOVER THIS YEAR 
REACHED A NEW HIGH. 
TODAY ONE IN SEV C.E.O.S
SITTING THIS YEAR WILL NOT HAVE 
THEIR JOB NEXT YEAR.
SECOND MAJOR FINDING IS THAT OF 
THOSE C.E.O.S LEAVING,
PERFORMANCE IS ONE OF THE 
REASONS FOR DEPARTURE.
THEY DON'T USUALLY RESIGN.
THEY'RE BEING FORCED OUT OF 
OFFICE. 
>> THE CHARISMATIC SPOKESPERSON,
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.
IT IS NOW PERFORMANCE-BASED NOW 
MORE THAN EVER? 
>> YES. 
>> AND IN TERMS OF ONCE THAT
C.E.O. HAS LEFT THE COMPANY,
OBVIOUSLY THNEXT TASK IS
REPLACING THAT PERSON.
WHAT IS THE BEST COURSE OF
ACTION? 
>> BOARDS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 
WAYS OF REPLACING C.E.O.'S. 
THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 
BOARDS. 
THAT IS WHY YOU'RE SEEING 
C.E.O.S FORCED OUT. 
A COUPLE OF THE NEW MODELS THAT 
THEY PUT IN PLACE ARNOT 
WORKING.
ONE IS HIRING EXISTING C.E.O.'S 
TO COME IN AND BOME 
C.E.O.'S. 
THAT'S BIDDING UP THE PRICE FOR 
THE EXISTING C.E.O.'S BIDDING UP
THE PRICE FOR THE NEW C.E.O.'S
GOING INTO COMPANIES AND OUR
RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE 
RESULTS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE
NOT ANY BETTER. 
>> YOU SAY OUTSIDERS FLAME AND
THEN FIZZLE.
WHY IS THE OUTSIDER OFTEN --
>> OUTSIDERS TEND TO DO VERY
WELL IN THEIR FIRST TWO TO THREE
YEARS BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO
UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY OR THE
CULTURE AND EREFORE THEIR 
PERFORMANCE TOPS OUT AFTER TWO
TO THREE YEARS. 
THEREFORE OUR ADVICE IS IF
YOU'RE A BOARD HIRING 
OUTSIDER, HAVE A SUCCESSION PLAN
PLACE FOR YEAR FOUR WHERE AN 
INSIDER WILL TAKE OVER THAT 
ROLE. 
>> IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOME 
DON'T GIVE THAT NEXT C.E.O. THE 
CHANCEO GET UP TO SPEED.
THAT THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE
THERE AND THEY COULD SHOOT
THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT? 
>> THERE IS THAT CHANCE.
IT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK LAST 
YORE. 
MANY C.E.O.S WERE BROUGHT IN AND
IN THE FIRST SIX TO 12 MONTHS 
WERE LET GO.
BY AND LARGE C.E.O.S ARE GIVEN
ADEQUATE RUN TIME.
BUT THERE IS A BAR BEING PUT UP 
WHICH IS PERFORM OR MOVE ON.
>> PAUL KOCOUREK, SENIOR VICE 
PRESENT AT BOOZ ALLEN 
HAMILTON. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
REMEMBER, YOU CAN GET THE LATEST
BUSINESS NEWS ANYTIME AT OUR

>> I'M RON CORNING IN NEW 
YORK. 
THESE ARE THE HEADLINES THIS
HOUR FROM ABC NEWS. 
THE SATURATED EAST COAST IS 
BRACING FOR MORE DOWNPOURS AFTER
HEAVY RAIN POUNDED THE NATION'S 
CAPITAL, FLOODING THE 
SMITHSONIAN MUSEUMS, THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT AND OTHER GOVERNMENT 
BUILDINGS.
RUSH LIMBAUGH IS FACING POSSIBLE
DRUG CHARGES IN FLORIDA.
HE WAS DETAINED AT PALM BEACH 
AIRPORT FOR CARRYING VIAGRA 
WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION. 
LIMBAUGH'S ATTORNEY SAYS THE
DRUG WAS ISSUED TO THE DOCTOR TO
PROTECT HIS CLIENT'S
PRIVACY.
AND IN HOUSTON, POLICE OFFICERS 
TESTIFYING IN ANDREA YATES' 
SECOND MURDER TRIAL SAY SHE 
SHOWED NO SIGNS OF EMOTION AFTER
DROWNING HER FIVE CHILDREN. 
THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES
FOUNDATION IS NOW WORTH $60 
BILLION, THANKS TO WARREN 
BUFFETT'S MEGA DONATION.
THEY'RE HOPING TO USE THEIR 
POOLED RESOURCES IN A JOINT 
VENTURE TO HELP MILLIONS OF THE 
WORLD'S NEEDIEST PEOPLE.
C'S DAN HARRIS HAS MORE.
>> THERE WE GO. 
>> WHAT CAN THE GATES/BUFFETT 
TEAM DO WITH $60-PLUS 
BILLION?
LET'S PICK FOUR OF THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST PROBLEMS. 
THESE DOLLAR FIGURES ARE ALL
ESTIMATES, BUT -- 
MALARIA, WITH $6 BILLION, YOU 
COULD ADICATE A DISEASE THAT
KILLS ONE PERSON EVERY 30 
SECONDS.
H.I.V./AIDS.
FOR $16 BILLION A YEAR, YOU 
COULD TREAT EVERY ONE OF THE 40 
MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE
INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS.
CHILD HEALTH. 
$5 BILLION FOR VACCINES AND 
MEDICINES COULD SAVE SIX MILLION
CHILDREN A YEAR.
AND WORLD HUNGER. 
FOR $8 BILLION A YEAR, YOU COULD
CUT IT IN HALF. 
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT
OF RESOURCES THAT ARE NOW GOING 
TO BE IN THE GATES FOUNDATION,
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT LITERALLY
TENS OF MILLIONS OF LIVES SAVED 
OVERHE NEXT DECADE. 
>> OF COURSE, THE GATES 
FOUNDATION WON'T SPEND $60
BILLION A YEAR. 
BUT IT MAY SOON BE SPENDING $3
BILLION A YEAR. 
THAT DWARFS UNICEF, THE WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE RED 
CROSS.
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE ANNUAL 
BUDGET OF BOLIVIA.
AND THE DREAMS OF THIS
PHILANTHROPIC DREAM TEAM GO WELL
BEYOND THE PROBLEMS TO WHICH YOU
CAN ATTACH A PRICE TAG. 
FOR INSTANCE, A FIRST-CLASS 
EDUCATION FOR EVERY AMERICAN
CHILD.
>> CAN THAT BE DONE IN OUR
LIFETIME? 
I'LL BE OPTIMISTIC AND SAY
ABSOLUTELY. 
>> AND AN END TO AIDS.
>> I THINK WE DREAM IN OUR
LIFETIME ABOUT AN AIDS
VACCINE.
>> LOFTY GOALS TO WHICH WARREN
BUFFETT SEEMS TO BE SUBSCRIBING 
ALMOST WITHOUT QUESTION.
HE'LL BE A TRUSTEE IN THE 
FOUNDATION, BUT HE INDICATED
THAT HE WILL PRIMARILY CONTINUE 
TO FOCUS ON WHAT HE DOES BEST,
MAKING MONEY 
>> I'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE WHERE I 
SAY, YOU CAN GIVE IT AWAY BETTER
THAN I CAN, SO I'M TURNING IT 
OVER TO YOU AND YOU CAN DO A
BETTER JOB OF GIVING IT AWAY
THAN I WOULD. 
>> BUT THE IMPACT MAY GO WELL 
BEYOND ALL THE MONEY THAT THE 
GATES AND BUFFETT ARE GIVING
AWAY. 
>> OTHER PEOPLE MAY BE CALLED TO
ACTION AND DECIDE TO GIVE MONEY 
AWAY AND TO GIVE THEIR TIME INTO
THE WORLD OF PHILANTHROPY, WHEN 
THEY SEE PEOPLE LIKE BUFFETT AND
GATES, THAT MIGHT MAKE THEM 
CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDAND BE
MORE GIVING.

BODY A LOT MORE GOOD THAN WE
THINK.
RESEARCHERS SAY COFFEE IS T 
JUST A MORNING EYE-OPENER, BUT
IT'S ALSO A WEAPON IN THE FIGHT 
AGAINST TYPE-TWO DIABETES AND 
OTHER DISEASES. 
ABC'S JOHN MCKENZIE HAS THE 
DETAILS.
>> I HAVE TO HAVE IT EVERY
MORNING.
>> WHY? 
>> IT KES ME UP.
>> IF I DON'T HAVE COFFEE, I'M
REALLY TIRED AND IRRITABLE AND
CRANKY. 
>> BUT MOUNTING EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS ALL THOSE LATTES AND 
CAPPUCCINOS MIGHT NOT ONLY
IMPROVE YOUR MOOD, THEY JUST
MIGHT IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH.
DAILY CUPS OF COFFEE HAVE EN
LINKED TO A REDUCED RISK OF 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE, LIVER
CANCER, GALL STONES AND 
ESPECIALLY TYPE TWO 
DIABETES. 
A VARIETY OF STUDIES HAVE NOW 
SHOWN THAT DRINKING FOUR CUPS OF
COFFEE A DAY, AND THESE ARE 
STANDARD CUPS, EIGHT OUNCES IN
EACH, IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 30%
REDUCTION IN THE RISK OF
DEVELOPING DIABETES.
AND THE REARCH SUGGESTS THE 
MORE COFFEE YOU DRINK, THE
GREATER THE PROTECTION. 
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE 
TO GET WIRED. 
THE STUDY OUT TODAY FOUND DECAF 
JUST AS EFFECTIVE AGAINST 
DIABETES AS REGULAR, CAFFINATED 
COFFEE. 
BOTH ARE LOADEWITH THE SAME 
NUTRIENTS AND AS RESEARCHERS
HAVE DISCOVERED, MUCH MORE. 
>> WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE
COMPOUNDS IN COFFEE WHICH, WHEN 
GIVEN TO A RAT, ENHANCE THE 
CAPACITY OF ITS LIVER TO BURN 
SUGAR, MUCH LIKE ANTI-DIABETIC
MEDICATIONS.
>> INTRIGUING RESEARCH SAY
DOCTORS, BUT STILL VERY 
PRELIMINARY TO PRESCRIBE A 
COUPLE OF DOUBLE ERESSOS EVERY
DAY.
BUT FOR THOSE ALREADY DOWNIN
THEIR DAILY CUPS OF JAVA, EVEN A
POSSIBLE HEALTH BENEFIT IS ONE
MORE THING TO SAVOR.

PLATE UMPIRE.
TOOK OUT HIS RAGE ON HOME PLATE

ALREADY.
A FULL INVESTIGATION INTO THE

WHICH LEFT FOLKS WITHOUT JOBS
AND CAUSED HUGE CUT BACKS.
>> Bill: GOVENOR IS TOLING THE
STATE LEGISLATURE INTO SPECIAL
SESSION TO DEAL WITH THE

SPLEEPING WHILE 50 MENS OF THE 
LOCAL ELKS LODGE GATHERED FOR AN
INITIAL AREA CEREMONY.
DESPITE THE OVERNIGHT EFFORTS OF
MORE THAN 200 RESCUE WORKERS, 
ONE MAN WHO IS CALLED THE 
EXALTED RULER OF THE CLUB, WAS 
TRAPPED AND DIED INSIDE.
WE'LL TALK TO ONE OF THE MEN WHO

DEBRIS.
>> AND PRESIDENT BUSH JUMPING 
RIGHT INTO THE FIGHT OVER THE 
EXPOSURE IN SEVERAL LEADING 
NEWSPAPERS OF A SECRET PROGRAM 
UNDER WAY TO TRACK TERRORISTS' 
MONEY.
PRESIDENT BUSH CALLED THE 
STORIES DISGRACEFUL, SAID THE 
NEWSPAPERS SHOULDN'T HAVE 
PUBLISHED THEM, SAID THEY DO 
GREAT HARM TO THE NATION.
>> AS WELL AS THIS ANGER 
MANAGEMENT STORY.
WE SHOWED YOU THE TAPE MONDAY.

MAJOR LEAGUE MELTDOWN.

MANAGER WHO FINALLY COLLECTED

WE'RE GOING TO GET ANOTHER SET 
OF HIS MEMORIES, THESE ONE 
FAVORITE MEMORIES OF WHAT HE'S 
CALLED AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL.
AND, OH, BOY, IS IT.
STICK AROUND.
>> FIRST WE START WITH THIS 
BUILDING COLLAPSE OVERNIGHT IN 
CLINTON, MISSOURI.
WE'VE BEEN COVERING THE STORY 
DURING THE NEWT.
NINE SURVIVORS, ONE DEAD.
BUT HERE IS SONIA WITH THE 
LATEST DETAILS.
>> THE PRAYERS OF A COMMUNITY 
WERE ANSWERED AS THE SURVIVORS 
EMERGED.
THEY'D SPENT HOURS TRAPPED IN A 
10-BY-12-FOOT SPACE IN THE 
CRUMBLING BUILDING.
>> MY FATHER IS ALIVE AND DOING 
WELL.
>> THE ELKS CLUB WAS MARKING ITS
100TH ANNIVERSARY HAD THE 
BUILDING BUCKLED AND COLLAPSED.
ABOUT 40 PEOPLE MADE IT OUT, 
LEAVING 10 TRAPPED.
RESCUERS WORKED ALL NIGHT TO 
REACH THEM USING LADDERS, 
CAMERAS, SOUND DEVICES AND DOGS.
THE SMALL TOWN OF CLINTON, 
MISSOURI COULD NOT SIMPLY SIT 
AND WAIT.
>> WE TOOK VOLUNTEERS OUT
OF THE CROWD.
THEY RESPONDED AND WENT
TO A LOCAL LUMBERYARD
AND THEY STARTED GATHERING
MATERIALS SO THEY COULD BE USED
TO SHORE UP THE BUILDING.
>> ALL THOSE TRAPPED WERE
REACHED BY CELL PHONE,
EXCEPT ONE.
RESCUERS FOUND HIS BODY THIS 
MORNING.
THE COMMUNITY OF CLINTON DID NOT
GET THE MIRACLE THEY WERE HOPING
FOR.
GORE "GOOD MORNING AMERICA," 
SONYA CRAWFORD, ABC NEWS.
>> JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO I 
SPOKE WITH ONE OF THOSE RESCUED 
FROM THE COLLAPSE AND ALSO 
RICHARD SMOKY DIRE, THE KANSAS 
CITY FIRE CHIEF, WHOSE MEN HAVE 
JOINED IN HELPING WITH THE 
RESCUE EFFORTS.
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT 
ACTUALLY HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE SENSATION OF
FEELING A BUILDING JUST FALLING 
DOWN AROUND YOU.
>> WELL, QUITE OBVIOUSLY, 
SOMETHING YOU'VE NEVER PLANNED 
TO EXPERIENCE AND YOU DON'T EVER
WANT TO EXPERIENCE AGAIN.
BUT AS WE WERE PREPARING TO HAVE
A MEETING AT APPROXIMATELY 7:30,
WE'D FINISHED OUR MEAL AND THE 
FLOORS JUST GAY AWAY AND THE 
BUILDING STARTED TO FALL APART 
AROUND US.
>> DID YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY WHAT 
WAS HAPPENING?
>> EVERYBODY HAD A PRETTY GOOD 
IDEA THE BUILDING WAS FALLING IN
AND IT WAS SOMETHING MAJOR.
WE CHECKED ON THE PEOPLE AROUND 
US AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLANS TO
EVACUATE.
>> DID IT HAPPEN GRADALLY OR WAS
IT, BAM, ALL AT ONCE?
>> IT WAS ALL AT ONCE.
THE WHOLE PROCESS PROBABLY TOOK
LESS THAN 10 SECONDS
FROM THE TIME WE FIRST SAW
THE FLOOR FALL IN UNTIL IT WAS
COMPLETED.
>> DID YOU THINK YOU WERE
A GONER?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WHEN THE FLOOR GIVES AWAY UNDER
YOU, YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO GO,
EVERYTHING TURNING PITCH BLACK,
YOU'RE JUST RUNNING FOR ANYTHING
YOU CAN GRAB HOLD OF, YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT
IT.
YOU'RE PRETTY SURE YOU'RE DONE
FOR.
>> CHIEF, I'M STRUCK BY HOW MANY
PEOPLE RESPONDED.
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF 
RESCUE PEOPLE THERE.
WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU GOT 
THERE?
>> WE HAVE A VERY EFFECTIVE 
STATEWIDE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND 
THE CALL WENT OUT FOR ASSISTANCE
FROM THE CITY OF CLINTON AND 
FROM HENDRICK COUNTY.
OVER 51 FIRE DEPARTMENTS FROM 
THROUGHOUT WESTERN MISSOURI 
RESPONDED TO THEIR CALL FOR 
HELP.
>> WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET 
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS?
DO YOU TRY TO PROPER DB PROP THE
BUILDING UP OR JUST PULL THE 
RUMBLE ASIDE?
>> ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THINGS TO DO IS, YES, TO SHORE 
UP THE DEBRIS ON THE INSIDE.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WENT 
VERY WELL HERE WERE THE LOCAL 
OFFICIALS HOLDING BACK SEARCH 
AND RESCUE EFFORTS UNTIL WE 
COULD GET THE PROPER EQUIPMENT 
AND TRAINED PERSONNEL ON THE 
SCENE SO THAT WE COULD USE HEAVY
RESCUE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO 
THE SEARCH IN A SAFE MANNER.
>> BARRY, WHEN THE BUILDING WAS 
COMING DOWN, I UNDERSTAND YOU 
REALLY SCATTERED TO GET OUT?
>> WELL, YEAH.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS, AS
YOU'RE RUNNING ACROSS THE FLOOR 
AND IT'S GIVING AWAY BEHIND YOU,
SO YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO 
STOP RUNNING BECAUSE THE FLOOR 
IS GOING TO CATCH UP WITH YOU.
YOU WONDER IF IT'S EVER GOING TO
QUIT FALLING AWAY FROM YOU.
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO A
SAFE AREA TO WHERE WE COULD EXIT
THE BUILDING THROUGH A STAIRWAY.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH, BARRY AND 
CHIEF DYER.
NOW THE REST OF THE MORNING 
HEADLINES WITH ROBIN.
>> WE BEGIN WITH ALL THAT RAIN
IN THE MID-ATLANTIC.
RECORD RAIN CAUSING DANGEROUS
CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY HARD
HIT, THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
DAVID KERLEY JOINS US
FROM WASHINGTON.
>> WE HAD JUST ANOTHER HUGE
THUNDERSTORM JUST A FEW MINUTES
AGO, REALLY HEAVY RAIN.
BUT THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS ALONG
CONSTITUTION AVENUE IS THIS.
THIS IS AN EIGHT-INCH HOSE
AND A COUPLE OF SIX-INCHERS
BEHIND ME ARE DRAINING OUT
THE I.R.S. BUILDING.
THIS BUILDING LIKE SEVERAL
OTHERS ALONG CONSTITUTION SHUT
DOWN FOR A SECOND DAY.
DAMAGE FROM THE FLOODWATERS IS
SINKING IN AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT AS SENSITIVE
ELECTRONICS EQUIPMENT WAS PULLED
OUT AND THERE WAS WORD THAT
THE BUILDING MIGHT BE CLOSED
FOR UP TO A WEEK.
PUMPS ARE TRYING TO EMPTY
BASEMENTS, THE NATIONAL
ARCHIVES, THE CUSTOMERS
DEPARTMENT WHERE TOURISTS WERE
TURNED AWAY FROM THE NATIONAL
AQUARIUM.
>> WE DON'T HAVE RAIN LIKE THIS
IN GERMANY.
>> MARYLAND, ALL UP THE COAST.
IN A PARKING GARAGE, CARS WERE
TOSSED.
ONE LEANED ON A FREEWAY
UNDERPASS.
THE RAIN WA SO HEAVY,
DOZENS FLED THEIR HOMES,
INCLUDING FAYE KARAS, WHO ENDED
UP IN A HIGH SCHOOL USED
AS AN EVACUATION CENTER.
>> I THINK THAT THE WATER CAME
UP SO FAST, PEOPLE WERE PRETTY
SURPRISED BY IT.
>> IT ISN'T OVER.
THE STUBBORN SYSTEM WILL
CONTINUE TO SIT OVER THE EAST
COAST.
>> THAT PARTNER IS GOING
TO PERSIST AT LEAST INTO TUESDAY
EVENING.
>> SO ANOTHER 24 HOURS OF THIS
RAIN IN JUST THE LAST
12 HOURS IN THE WASHINGTON AREA
WE'VE HAD BETWEEN A HALF INCH
AND AN INCH OF RAIN.
>> THANK YOU, DAVID.
DAVID KERLEY IN D.C.
>>> IN IRAQ, THREE U.S. TROOPS
ARE THE LATEST IN THE VIOLENCE.
ONE SOLDIER AND TWO MARINES HAVE
DIED.
>>> BACK HOME, THE SENATE IS
EXPECTED TO VOTE ON
THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE
OF WHETHER PROTECTING THE RED,
WHITE AND BLUE TRUMPS FREE
SPEECH.
JAKE TAPPER IS ON CAPITOL HILL
THIS MORNING WITH THIS STORY.
>> SUPPORTERS OF THE FLAG
DESECRATION AMENDMENT SAY
THEY'VE NEVER HAD A BETTER
CHANCE THAN RIGHT NOW TO PASS
THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
THE VOTE IN THE SENATE IS
LITERALLY UP FOR GRABS.
NOT A COINCIDENCE THIS IS ALL
TAKING PLACE DURING AN ELECTION
YEAR.
AN IMAGE MANY AMERICANS FIND
OFFENSIVE.
WHILE BURNING A FLAG AS A FORM
OF PROTEST IS RARE COMPARED
TO THE 1960'S AND 1970'S,
THE SENATE TODAY WILL DEBATE
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT
AGAINST FLAG DESECRATION.
>> TO DESECRATE THE AMERICAN
FLAG IS TO DESECRATE THE MEMORY
OF THE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS
OF ADMINISTERS WHO HAVE
SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES TO KEEP
OUR FLAG FLYING.
>> OPPONENTS SAY IT IS A BLOW
AGAINST FREE SPEECH.
>> IT WOULD STRIKE AT THE VALUES
THE FLAG REPRESENTS.
>> SUPPORTERS NEED 67 VOTES
IN THE SENATE TO PASS
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
THE LATEST COUNT IS 66.
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT
THE AMENDMENT, THOUGH FLAG
BURNING DOES NOT REIGNING HIGH
ON VOTERSE LISTS OF CONCERNS.
REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS HOPE WHEN
COMBINED WITH ISSUES LIKE
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND
IMMIGRATION REFORM, THIS WEEK'S
DEBATE IS SMART POLITICS
FOR NOVEMBER.
>> I THINK IT GIVES REPUBLICANS
WHO ARE RUNNING EITHER
AS CHALLENGERS OR AS KNOW
CUMBANTS A PRETTY BROAD PALETTE
ON WHICH TO PAINT THEIR
OPPONENT.
>> IF THIS WERE TO PASS THE 
SENATE, 38 OUT OF 50 STATE LEDGE
SLATE TURS WOULD HAVE TO RATIFY 
IT.
SO THIS ALL COMES DOWN TO ONE 
VOTE IN THE SENATE.
IT'S SOME HIGH DRAMA.
>> JAKE, THANK YOU.
JAKE TAPPER ON CAPITOL HILL.
>>> FINALLY, POLICE IN CITY
PETERSBURG ARE LOOKING FOR THIS
BURGLAR WHO FELL EIGHT FEET
THROUGH THE ROOF OF A GAS
STATION.
HE APPARENTLY WASN'T HURT THAT
MUCH.
HE'S SEEN LATER GRABBING ABOUT
$1,000 FROM THE REGISTER.
BUT HE'S PACE THE PRICE FOR IT,
BELIEVE ME.
>> I HATE IT WHEN YOU DON'T PLAN
AHEAD.
>> FALL THROUGH THE ROOF LIKE
THAT.
>> TIME NOW FOR THE WEATHER
AND MIKE BARZ.
>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
HAPPY TUESDAY TO YOU.
WE SAW DAVID KERLEY TALKING
ABOUT ALL THAT RAIN IN D.C.
THE LATEST RADAR PICTURE,
MORE FLASH FLOOD WATCHES
FOR THAT AREA.
D.C. HAS ALREADY SEEN NEARLY
10 INCHES OF RAIN SINCE SUNDAY,
MORE THAN FOUR TIMES
THEIR AVERAGE.
THE TIME RIGHT NOW IS 7:12.
DIANE?
>> THANKS, MIKE.
UP NEXT, THE PRESIDENT
AND THE WHITE HOUSE EXPRESSING
OUTRAGE AT THE MEDIA.
THE PRESIDENT MAKING A VERY
BLUNT ACCUSATION THAT THE PRESS
IS MAKING IT HARDER TO WIN
THE WAR ON TERRORISM
BY REVEALING SECRET PROGRAMS.
HIS ANGER WAS SPARKED BY A STORY
BROKEN BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
AND OTHER LEADING NEWSPAPERS
ABOUT A SECRET EFFORT TO TRACK
THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
OF TERRORISTS.
ABC'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT
JESSICA YELLIN HAS MORE ON THOSE
HEATED WORDS FROM WASHINGTON
THIS MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING.
IT IS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
VERSES "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ONCE
AGAIN.
THE TIMES TIMES SAYS IT 
PUBLISHED THE INFORMATION 
BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO
BE.
BUT THE FIGHT HAS SPARKED A 
FIERCE NATIONAL DEBATE.
PRESIDENT BUSH IS BLASTING
THE MEDIA FOR PUBLISHING
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AGAIN.
>> THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS
PROGRAM IS DISGRACEFUL
AND THE FACT THAT A NEWSPAPER
DISCLOSED IT MAKES IT HARDER
TO WIN THIS WAR ON TERROR.
>> CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO IS
PICKING UP HIS MESSAGE.
>> BASICALLY WHAT "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" HAS BECOME, HASN'T IT?
I MEAN, IT'S A TERRORIST TIP
SHEET.
>> AND THE DEBATE IS DRAWING
HEAT ON CABLE TV.
>> TELL ME WHERE I'M WRONG.
>> SHUT UP FOR TWO SECONDS
AND I WILL.
>> CHRIS, DID YOU WANT THEM
TO TELL "THE NEW YORK TIMES" NOT
TO PUBLISH?
>> AT ISSUE?
THIS "NEW YORK TIMES" ARTICLE
REVEALING A SECRET PROGRAM
DESIGNED TO TRACK TERRORISTS'
MONEY.
IT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE
9/11 WITH NO JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT
OR LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING IT.
THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT'S
LEGAL AND PRESSED "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" AND TWO OTHER PAPERS NOT
TO PUBLISH DETAILS OF
THE PROGRAM.
BUT ERIC LITCHBLAU, WHO BROKE
THE STORY FOR THE "TIMES,"
POINTS OUT MANY COMPANIES
INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM DOUBT
ITS LEGALITY.
>> WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TILT
THE DEBATE OR INFLUENCE IT ONE
WAY OR THE OTHER.
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO INFORM
THE PUBLIC DEBATE.
>> BUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
MAINTAINS THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
WHEN SECURITY IS AT STAKE.
LATE MONDAY, TREASURY SECRETARY
JOHN SNOW SENT "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" THIS LETTER SLAMMING
THEIR IRRESPONSIBLE AND HARMFUL
REPORTING AND REPRESENTIVE PETER
KING IS CALLING ON THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT TO PROSECUTE THOSE
AT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WHO
PUBLISHED THE PIECE.
>> THEY'VE PUT AMERICAN LIVES
AT RISK AND COMPROMISED
THE PROGRAM AND TO ME
THEIR CONDUCT WAS ABSOLUTELY
DISGRACEFUL AND IT'S CRIMINAL
AND IT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED.
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SAYS
THEY HAVE WITHHELD OTHER STORIES
BEFORE BECAUSE THEY WERE
CONVINCED PUBLISHING THEM MIGHT
COMPROMISE NATIONAL SECURITY.
THEY SAY THEY WERE UNCONVINCE
THIS CASE.
THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES"
AND THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"
ALSO PUBLISHED SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT THIS ANTI-TERROR PROGRAM.
CHARLIE?
>> JESSICA YELLIN AT THE WHITE
HOUSE, THANKS VERY MUCH.
WE TURN NOW TO ANOTHER
CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC --
THE FUTURE OF THE PRISON
AT GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA,
HOLDING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.
THE SUPREME COURT COULD RULE
TODAY ON THE FUTURE
OF THE DETAINEES BEING HELD
THERE.
A NEW ABC NEWS POLL FINDS THAT
71% OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
OPPOSE THE CURRENT TERMS
OF THEIR IMPRISONMENT.
NIGHTLINE ANCHOR TERRY MORAN IS
THERE THIS WEEK AND HE HAD
A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW
THE PRISON'S DIRECTOR
OF INTERROGATIONS.
HE IS WITH US THIS MORNING.
TERRY, GOOD MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING, CHARLIE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHILE THE FUTURE OF THIS PLACE
MAY BE IN SOME DOUBT
BECAUSE OF THAT SUPREME COURT
CASE BECAUSE PRESIDENT BUSH SAYS
HE WANTS TO SHUT THIS PLACE
DOWN, TODAY IS JUST ANOTHER DAY
FOR THE 450 OR SO DETAINEES
BEHIND THAT WIRE AND
THE AMERICANS WHO GUARD THEM
AND TREAT THEM AND FEED THEM
AND INTERROGATE THEM.
IT IS A PLACE FULL OF CONTRASTS,
WHERE YOU CAN HERE THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM AND THE MUSLIM CALL
TO PRAYER OVER THE LOUD SPEAKERS
FIVE TIMES A DAY.
THE MAN WHO RUNS THE
INTERROGATIONS TOLD US THEY ARE
CONDUCTED HUMANELY, NO TORTURE,
AND THEY CONTINUE TO ELICIT
VALUABLE INTELLIGENCE.
INSIDE THE WIRE AT GUANTANAMO
BAY, DETAINEES GET AN HOUR
OF EXERCISE IN 10-BY-18-FOOT
PENS.
GUARDS CHECK THE CELLS EVERY
THREE MINUTES, PARTLY TO PREVENT
SUICIDES, AND FIVE TIMES A DAY
THE MUSLIM CALL TO PRAYER SOUNDS
OVER THE CAMP.
AND THEN THERE ARE THE
INTERROGATIONS.
WE WERE TAKEN TO ONE
INTERROGATION ROOM,
WHERE BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE IS
A LOUISIANA BOY FOR DETAINEES
TO SIT IN, THOUGH SOME REMAIN
SHACKLED TO THE FLOOR
DURING SESSIONS.
GUANTANAMO'S MANY CRITICS MIGHT
BE SKEPTICAL.
>> THEY MAY LOOK AT THIS PICTURE
AND SAY YOU'RE STAGING THIS.
>> WE DO HAVE INTERROGATION
ROOMS THAT ARE MORE AUSTERE THAN
THIS.
>> PAUL RESTER IS THE CHIEF
OF INTERROGATIONS AT GUANTANAMO
BAY.
IN THE TEETH OF INTERNATIONAL
CONTROVERSY ABOUT THIS PLACE,
HE IS FIERCELY PROUD OF HIS WORK
HERE.
>> WHAT PEOPLE FORGET IS THAT
WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE
FIRST BROUGHT HERE, THERE WERE
FOUR SMOKING HOLES IN
THE GROUND.
>> WHAT IS TORTURE?
>> FOR MYSELF, TORTURE IS
THE DELIBERATE AND SADISTIC
INFLICTION OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL
PAIN ON ANOTHER WHOM BEING.
>> HE INSISTS THAT THOUGH
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES HERE
HAVE BEEN TOUGH, THEY HAVE NEVER
CROSSED THE LINE TO TORTURE.
>> NONE OF IT HAVE REACHED
OR EXCEEDED WHAT MY MORAL VIEW
OF TORTURE IS.
WAS IT COMFORTABLE?
NO.
WAS IT SUBJECTIVELY DISTASTEFUL?
PROBABLY.
>> EVERY DAY IS A STRUGGLE HERE
TO KEEP THE DETAINEES ALIVE.
THREE OF THEM COMMITTED SUICIDE
THIS MONTH.
WE'LL HAVE AN INTERVIEW
WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE CAMP.
WE'LL BE HERE ALL WEEK
FOR "NIGHTLINE."
>> TURN TO PAGE, IF YOU WILL,
TO NEWS THAT HAS SHOCKED
MILLIONS OF READERS AROUND
THE WORLD.
THE AUTHOR OF THE HARRY POTTER
BOOKS HAS HINTED THAT THE BOY
WIZARD MIGHT NOT SURVIVE
THE LAST INSTALLMENT
OF THE SERIES.
NICK WATT BRINGS US THE LATEST

GOOD MORNING, ROBIN.
SHE HAS SOLD 300 MILLION COPIES
OF THESE BOOKS.
KIDS AND ADULTS ENJOY HARRY
POTTER IN 63 DIFFERENT
LANGUAGES.
BUT THERE MIGHT BE A FEW KIDS
CRYING THEMSELVES TO SLEEP.
APPARENTLY THERE IS NOT A HAPPY
ENDING.
SHE'S ALWAYS PLANNED SEVEN BOOKS
AND THIS IS THE SEVENTH.
THE FINAL CHAPTER WAS WRITTEN
BACK IN 1990, BEFORE THE FIRST
VOLUME WAS EVEN PUBLISHED.
ONLY NOW IS SHE HINTING THAT
THE BOY WIZARD WILL MEET
A STICKY END.
SHE WON'T SAY FOR SURE.
BUT SHE SAID THIS ON BRITISH
TELEVISION LAST NIGHT.
>> I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND,
HOWEVER, THE MENTALITY
OF AN AUTHOR WHO THINKS I'M
GOING TO KILL THEM OFF SO THERE
CAN BE NO NON-AUTHOR-WRITTEN
SEQUELS, SO IT WILL END WITH ME.
>> SHE SAYS SHE'LL KILL TWO
CHARACTERS.
>> THE PRICE HAS TO BE PAID.
WE ARE DEALING WITH PURE EVIL,
SO WE DON'T TARGET THE EXTRAS,
DO THEY?
>> FANS HAVE ONLY ONE MORE BOOK
AND THREE MORE MOVIES TO SAFER.
THE NEXT, "HARRY POTTER
AND THE ORDER OF PHOENIX" HITS
THEATERS NEXT SUMMER.
SHER LOCK HOMES WAS KILLED
IN 1893 BUT DOYLE RESUSCITATED
THE FAMOUS DETECTIVE.
BUT IF YOU CAN'T BEAR
THE THOUGHT OF HARRY DEMISE,
THINK SHER LOCK HOLMES.
ROWLING IS NOW EVEN RICHER THAN
THE QUEEN.
SURELY NOTHING CAN TOP THAT.
>> I'LL BET HE DOESN'T DIE.
>> YOU'RE ON.
I THINK HE WILL.
>> I DON'T GET INTO BETS
ANYMORE.

>> AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ON THE 
BROADCAST, SOME RECOMMEND 
NIVENSES.
IF THERE IS ANYTHING I HOPE 
WE'VE DONE IS TO SHOW JUST HOW 
MAGNIFICENT, BEAUTIFUL AND 
VARIED THIS COUNTRY TRULY IS.
AFTER ALL, IT IS CALLED "GOOD 
MORNING AMERICA."
IF ANY DAY BROUGHT THAT HOME, IT
WAS SITTING, LITERALLY, ON THE 
EDGE OF THE GRAND CANYON.
I REMEMBER SAYING -- PUT DOWN 
YOUR TOOTH BRUSH, YOUR FRYING 
PAN.
I HOPE YOU HAVE A BIG SCREEN 
TELEVISION BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO 
JUST SOAK THIS IN.
THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE BEEN FIND
IF WE'D JUST LOOKED AT PICTURES 
OF THE GRAND CANYON FOR THE FULL
TWO HOURS.
OUR PRODUCER, JACK RILEY, CAME 
UP WITH THE IDEA WE SHOULD TAKE 
BUS TRIPS THROUGH VARIOUS PARTS 
OF AMERICA AND BROADCAST FROM A 
DIFFERENT CITY EACH DAY OF THE 
WEEK.
IT WAS A WONDERFUL IDEA.
OUR FIRST TRIP WAS IN THE 
MIDWEST.
WE KNEW WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING 
WHEN EVERY STUDENT IN WINTER 
SETH, IOWA STOOD OUTSIDE OF 
THEIR SCHOOL FOR AN HOUR TO SEE 
IT.
AND WE HADN'T EVEN SCHEDULED TO 
BE THERE.
SO MANY PEOPLE CAME IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO GREET US 
IN ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA 
THAT JOAN LUNDEN AND I ALMOST 
MISSED THE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF 
ALL THE TRAFFIC.
AND IN STILLWATER, MINNESOTA, 
THE POLICE CHIEF TOLD US THERE 
WERE THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE 
ON HAND TO WATCH US DO THE 
PROGRAM THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE 
WHO LIVE IN STILLAWAY.
PEOPLE HAVE TURNED OUT 
EVERYWHERE WE'VE GONE, ALWAYS 
ASKING THE SAME QUESTION -- WHAT
DO YOU THINK OF OUR CITY?
THEY ASK IT IN ONE-STOP TOWNS 
AND IN THE LARGEST OF CITIES.
LOCAL PRIDE IS ALIVE AND WELL.
BUT JACK WAS RIGHT.
THIS COUNTRY IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
FROM THE WHITE STEEPLED CHURCHES
IN NEW ENGLAND TO THE BIG SIR IN
CALIFORNIA, EVERYWHERE WE HAVE 
GONE, THE VARIETY OF VISTAS THIS
COUNTRY AFFORDS INSPIRES.
MEMORABLE MOMENTS ALONG THE WAY 
-- FLYING A GLIDER OVER THE 
ARIZONA DESERT.
PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE UNTIL MY 
CO-PILOT DECIDED TO FLY UPSIDE 
DOWN.
RELEASING AN EAGLE NURSED BACK 
TO HEALTH IN ALASKA.
ONE OF THE MEN WHO CARED FOR THE
EAGLE SAID, WHEN WE REMOVE THE 
HOOD, HE'S GOING TO TAKE OFF, 
CIRCLE OVER YOUR HEAD AS A 
GESTURE OF GRATITUDE AND FLY 
AWAY.
AND I THOUGHT, YEAH, RIGHT.
BUT WHEN THE HOOD WAS REMOVED, 
THE EAGLE TOOK OFF, CIRCLED OVER
MY HEAD, AND THEN FLEW AWAY.
BEAUTIFUL.

>> WHEREVER WE TRAVELED, WE 
THREW OUT "GOOD MORNING AMERICA"

THERE, AMONG THE CROWD, WAS THE 
PRESIDENT OF HARVARD JUMPING UP 
TRYING TO GRAB A "G.M.A." 
FRIDAYS BY.
BUT IN THE END, IT'S THE PEOPLE 
AND THE PICTURES THAT STICK IN

AMERICA, THE TRULY BEAUTIFUL.
ONE GLORIOUS MORNING, AS WE 
BROADCAST FROM ASPEN, JOHN 
DENVER JOINED US TO SING "ROCKY

OF GRAIN, PURPLE MOUNTAINS 
IMAGINE STI, FRUITED PLAINS.
IN THESE 19 YEARS, WE'VE SEEN IT
ALL.
WHEN DENVER STARTED TO SING, 
THERE WERE GUYS IN HAND GLIDERS 
COMING OFF THE MOUNTAIN.
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL STANDING 
THERE.
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT COUNTRY.
>> AND WHAT A WAY TO GET TO SEE 
IT.
HANDSHAKE BY HANDSHAKE.
>> YEP.
AND EVERYBODY COMES UP AND SAYS 
DON'T WE HAVE A GREAT PLACE TO 
LIVE?
YOU KNOW, YOU WORRY THAT 
EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME STORIES.
BUT IT'S NOT.
PEOPLE LOVE WHERE THEY LIVE.
>> AND THEY LOVE TO KNOW WHAT 
YOU THINK ABOUT THEIR HOMETOWN.
>> EXACTLY.
WE'VE LOVED EVERY ONE OF THEM.
IT'S BEEN SUCH A TREAT TO COME 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THESE 19 
YEARS.
>> IT'S TOO EARLY TO START 
CRYING.
WE HAVE ALL DAY TOMORROW.

AFTER THE TOP FLOOR AT THE ELKS
CLUB BUILDING SUDDENLY CAVED IN.
EARLY THIS MORNING, NINE MADE IT
OUT SAFELY.
BUT ONE HAS NOW DIED.
>>> ANOTHER DAY OF DRENCHING
RAIN IS CRIPPLING THE
MID-ATLANTIC.
WASHINGTON'S CONSTITUTION AVENUE
JUST ONE OF MANY ROADWAYS UNDER
WATER.
FLASH FLOOD WATCHES ARE EXPECTED
TO SAY IN EFFECT ALL DAY
FROM WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA
TO THE CAROLINAS AND NORTH
INTO VERMONT.
>>> BREAKING NEWS RIGHT NOW OUT 
OF GEORGIA.
AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT A MOTEL
NEAR THE ALABAMA BORDER.
THE BLAST DAMAGED A TWO-STORY 
INN.
THE BUILDING HAS PARTIALLY 
COLLAPSED.
THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED SHORTLY 
AFTER 9:00 A.M. .
NO WORD YET ON ANY INJURIES.
>>> THE TEMPERATURE IS RISING 
ALONG THE ISRAEL-GAZA BORDER.
MAJOR OFFENSIVES ARE BEING
THREATENED FROM A SOLDIER IS NOT
RETURNED.
THE U.S. IS PUSHING
FOR DIPLOMACY.
>>> AN EMBARRASSING INCIDENT
FOR RUSH LIMBAUGH.
HE WAS DETAINED AT A FLORIDA
AIRPORT AFTER CUSTOMS OFFICIALS
FOUND A BOTTLE OF VIAGRA
IN HIS LUGGAGE WITHOUT
A PRESCRIPTION.
THE LABEL WAS IN HIS DOCTOR'S
NAME TO PROTECT HIS PRIVACY.
NOW HE FACES MISDEMEANOR DRUG
CHARGES.
>>> AN INTRIGUING NEW STUDY
ON WHETHER BIRTH ORDER IS LINKED
TO HOMOSEXUALITY.
RESEARCHERS FOUND THE NUMBER
OF OLDER BROTHERS A MAN HAS
COULD INFLUENCE HIS SEXUAL
ORIENTATION.
HERE IS ABC'S TAINA HERNANDEZ.
>> DOUG WEAVER GREW UP
THE YOUNGEST OF FOUR BOYS
BUT ALWAYS FELT DIFFERENT.
>> I STARTED TO KNOW I WAS GAY
IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I NOTICED
THE GUYS MORE THAN THE GIRLS.
IF I GREW UP IN THE SAME
HOUSEHOLD AS THREE STRAIGHT
BROTHERS, WHY WOULD I BE
DIFFERENT?
SOMETHING INTERNAL TO ME
HAS TO BE THE ISSUE THAT CAUSED
IT TO BE DIFFERENT.
>> RESEARCHERS HAVE KNOWN
FOR SOME TIME THAT MEN
WITH OLDER BROTHERS MAY BE MORE
LIKELY TO BE GAY.
NOW A TEAM FROM CANADA HAS
STUDIED 944 MEN AND FOUND THAT
MEN WITH BIOLOGICAL OLDER
BROTHERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE
GAY WHILE THE MEN WITH OLDER
STEPBROTHERS WERE NOT.
EXPERTS SAY IT'S MORE EVIDENCE
THAT SEXUAL ORIENTATION MAY BE
ROOTED MORE IN BIOLOGY THAN
ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL FACTORS.
>> HERE IS ONE MORE INDICATION
THAT THERE ARE INDEED BIOLOGICAL
INFLUENCES ON HUMAN SEXUAL
ORIENTATION.
EACH ADDITIONAL OLDER BROTHER
A BOY HAS INCREASES HIS CHANCES
OF BEING GAY BY 1/3.
>> SCIENTISTS CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY,
BUT SOME BELIEVE THERE ARE
PROGRESSIVE BIOLOGICAL CHANGES
EACH TIME A MOTHER HAS A BABY
BOY.
THE MORE BOYS, THE MORE LIKELY
SHE IS TO HAVE A GAY SON.
STILL, ONLY ABOUT 5% OF MEN
WITH OLDER BROTHERS TURNS OUT
TO BE GAY.
BUT FOR DOUG WEAVER, THE STUDY
CONFIRMS SOMETHING HE'S ALWAYS
FELT.
>> WE ARE WHO WE ARE WHEN WE'RE
BORN.
>> FOR "GOOD MORNING AMERICA,"
TAINA HERNANDEZ, ABC NEWS.
>> A DISCOVERY OFF THE COAST
OF WASHINGTON STATE.
A TYPE OF CORAL MORE COMMONLY
FOUND IN THE ATLANTIC.
SCIENTISTS SPECULATE IT'S BEEN
THERE ALL ALONG.
THEY'RE JUST NOW FINDING IT.
AND ONLY 5% HAS EVER BEEN SEEN
BY HUMAN EYES.
>> BEAUTIFUL.
>> GORGEOUS.
THAT'S THE LATEST NEWS AT 8:06.
>> GOOD MORNING.
TALKING ABOUT WASHINGTON STATE,
THE NORTHWEST EXPERIENCING A BIT
OF A HEAT WAVE.
A LOT OF THESE TEMPERATURES ARE
RECORDS AND THIS MOVES
INTO THE COMBOOR TODAY.
SOME OF THESE TEMPERATURES
20 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.
LOOKING AT THE NATIONAL PICTURE,
NOT ONLY WILL RAIN AND FLOODING
BE AN ISSUE IN THE MID-ATLANTIC
STATES BUT SEVERE WEATHER ALSO
POSSIBLE FOR VIRGINIA AND NORTH
CAROLINA.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAIL
WITH THE POSSIBILITY
OF TORNADOES.
SEVERE WEATHER ALSO A THREAT
IN THE MIDWEST.
GOOD NEWS -- THIS FRONT SHOULD
PUSH EAST AND CLEAR OUT
BY WEDNESDAY.
>> CHARLIE, TESSA HERE FROM 
MISSOURI, WE'LL MISS, YOU 
CHARLIE.
DON'T FORGET, YOU CAN WATCH HIM 
ON "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT."
>> NICE PLUG, MIKE.
>> HOW DO WE LOVE CHARLIE?
>> COUNT THE WAYS.
>> WE CAN COUNT TO INFINITY ON 
ALL THE GIRLS HE'S LOVED BEFORE,
WHICH IS TO SAY HIS CO-CHORES.
ROBIN, JOAN LUNDEN AND I DECIDED
TO SIT DOWN AND TELL YOU A 
LITTLE ABOUT THE MAN WE KNOW YOU
LOVE, TOO.
CHARLIE IS A ROCK.
CHARLIE IS THE GUY SITTING NEXT 
TO YOU THAT SENSES THAT YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
NEXT AND HE'S RIGHT THERE FOR 
YOU.
YOU KNOW,HE AMAZING THING IS 
THAT IT WAS TRUE FROM DAY ONE.
WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER
THAT WELL WHEN WE STARTED OUT.
BUT SOMEHOW, INSTINCTIVELY I 
KNEW HE WAS THERE, A SAFETY NET,
A CUSHION, A LIFE RAFT.
HE'S CHARLIE!
YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK OF 
LAUGHTER.
I KNOW PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK THE 
NEWS IS VERY SERIOUS AND WE 
BRING A LOT OF SOBERING STUFF.
BUT FOR US ON THIS BROADCAST, 
THE THINGS THAT SIMPLY MAKE YOU 
-- 
>> AWWW!
>> DASH MAKE YOU JOYFUL ARE IN 
EQUAL AND COMPLETE MEASURE.
OUR CUPS RUN OVER ON THIS 
BROADCAST EVERY MORNING BECAUSE 
THERE'S SUCH A UNIVERSE OF IT.
>> HE HAS BEEN LIKE A BROTHER, 
AN UNCLE.
>> A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST?
>> HE'S THE ROCK.
HE'S EVERYTHING.
I CAN TALK SPORTS WITH HIM.
I CAN CRY WITH HIM.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT FAMILY.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING AND
THERE'S JUST SUCH -- VERY FEW 
PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU 
MEET THAT YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY 
COMFORTABLE WITH IN ALL 
SITUATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT HE IS
TO ME.
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE BIT BETTER 
BEING IN HIS PRESENCE BECAUSE HE
IS THAT TYPE OF JUST TAKE-CHARGE
BROADCASTER.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY BETTER 
LIVE WHEN IT COMES TO LIVE 
EVENTS.
THINGS ARE BREAKING, THINGS ARE 
HEAPING, AND HIS EYES LIGHT UP 
BECAUSE I THINK HE KNOWS HE'S 
GOING TO HAVE THAT RARE 
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING INFORMATION
TO PEOPLE AT HOME, THAT HE KNOWS
HE IS GOING TO REALLY BE THEIR 
VOICE, THEIR EARS, THEIR 
EVERYTHING.
OFTENTIMES AFTER MY FATHER 
PASSED AWAY HE'D COME INTO THE 
DRESSING ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR 
AND SAY LET'S TALK.
HE HAD THOSE LITTLE CHECK-INS.
THAT KIND OF COMPASSION AND 
GENTNESS, IT'S RARE.
TO HAVE THAT WITH SOMEBODY THAT 
YOU RESPECT SO MUCH AND SOMEONE 
YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF 
WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERY DAY?
I MEAN, THOSE ARE EARLY HOURS 
AND SOMETIMES WE'RE ALL A LITTLE
GRUMPY BECAUSE WE HAD TO GET UP 
AT 4:00.
AND I WAS EXCITED ABOUT SEEING 
CHARLIE EVERY DAY.
>> WHEN WE WERE ON LOCATION 
OVERSEAS OR WHEREVER WE WERE, 
CHARLIE WAS FOOT LOOSE AND FANCY
FREE AND I WAS ALWAY THERE WITH
A COUPLE KIDS IN TOE.
HE WOULD ALWAYS WAIT AND GET MY 
LUGGAGE DOWN AND WAIT FOR THE 
KIDS AND IT ALWAYS MEANT PICKING
UP A FEW BARBIE DOLLS AND PIECES
OF PUZZLE AND SHOES.
HE WAS THERE FOR EVERYONE.
HE WAS ALWAYS EVERYONE'S 
SHOULDER TO CRY ON AND HE WAS 
COMPASSIONATE AND YET HE HAD AN 
AMAZING STRENGTH ABOUT HIM.
WHEN THE OTHER ONE WAS ALSO 
BEING ORNERY, WOULD COULD SLAP 
THEM UPSIDE AND SAY KNOCK I 
OFF!
LEAVING.
LAST DAY.
BECAUSE FOR ME IT WASN'T JUST 
LEAVING THE SHOW BUT IT WAS 
LEAVING ALMOST LIKE A HUSBAND.
CHARLIE USED TO SAY WE SPEND 
MORE TIME TOGETHER SOMETIMES 
THAN WE DO WITH OUR SPOUSES.
IT WAS VERY HARD LEAVING 
CHARLIE.
>> I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT JOYS
IS TO SEE CHARLIE GET THE 
GIGGLES.
TO SEE CHARLIE ACTUALLY TAKEN BY
SURPRISE.
IT'S VERY HARD TO SURPRISE HIM.
HE PREPARES.
HE REALLY PREPARES!
BUT TO SEE HIM TAKEN BY 
SURPRISE, THROWN BY SOMETHING 
AND DISSOLVE IN LAUGHTER I ONE 
OF THE BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS ON 
EARTH, ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS 
OF MY UNIVERSE.
>> AW.
>> YOU HAVE ONE OF THE BEST 
LAUGHS AND SMILES.
WHEN THEY WERE PUTTING TOGETHER 
ALTHESE THINGS, THAT LITTLE, 
CROOKED SMILE OF YOURS IS SO 
PERFECT.
>> BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS THING, 
WITH YOU FINALLY FESS UP WHETHER
YOU PULLED ME DOWN INTO THAT 
SNOW OR NOT?
SINCE THIS DAY I DON'T KNOW.
>> I SAID YOU WERE MY ROCK.
NO, YOU WEREN'T.
I GRABBED FOR YOU AND THROUGH 
YOU DOWN!
>> ANYWAY, YOU GUYS ARE SWEET TO
DO THAT.
>> I KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS
MOMENT RIGHT NOW?
TOMORROW WE HAVE TO SHARE YOU.
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING BY.
I LOVE THIS MOMENT.
IT'S JUST US.
>> JUST US.
>> OH.
>> I LOVE IT.

>> I WANT TO SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW 
ON AVERAGE HOUSM COFFEE WE DRINK
A DAY.
ABOUT A CUFF 1/2.
ON AVERAGE, ABOUT 2/3 OF A CUP 
OF TEA PER AMERICAN.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE HEALTHY, 
WHICH SHOULD YOU BE DRINKING?
LET'S BEGIN WITH A NEW STUDY 
ABOUT COFFEE.
HERE IS ABC'S JOHN MCKENZIE.
>> ON ANY GIVEN MORNING, MORE 
THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS REA
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE TO 
JUMP-START THEIR DAY.
MANY ADMIT THEY'RE HOOKED.
>> I GUESS I'M ADDICTED TO 
CAFFEINE.
>> I HAVE TO HAVE IT EVERY 
MORNING.
>> WHY?
>> IT WAKES ME UP.
>> IF I DON'T HAVE IT I'M TIRED 
AND IRRITTABLE AND CRANKY.
>> BUT MOUNTING EVIDENCE 
SUGGESTION COFFEE MIGHT NOT ONLY
IMPROVE YOUR MOOD BUT ALSO YOUR 
HEALTH.
DAILY CUPS OF COEE HAVE BEEN 
LINKED TO A REDUCED RISK OF 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE, LIVER 
CANCER, GALLSTONES, AND 
ESPECIALLY TYPE-2 DIABETICS.
A VARIETY OF STUDIES SHOWS 
DRINKING FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE A 
DAY, STANDARD CUPS, EIGHT 
OUNCES, IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 30%
RISK OF REDUCTION IN DEVELOPING 
DIABETICS.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE 
TO GET WIRED.
THE STUDY FOUND DECAF JUST AS 
EFFECTIVE AGAINST DIABETICS AS 
REGULAR CAFFEINATED COFFEE.
BOTH ARE LOADED WITH THE SAME 
NUTRIENTS.
AS RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED, 
THERE'S MUCH MORE.
>> THERE ARE COMPOUNDS IN COFFEE
WHICH, WHEN GIVEN TO A RAT, 
ENHANCED THE CAPACITY OF ITS 
LIVER TO BURN SUGAR, MUCH LIKE 
ANTI-DIABETICIC MEDICATIONS.
>> DOCTORS STILL SAY THIS IS TOO
PRELIMINARY TO PRESCRIBED COFFEE
EVERY DAY.
>> I WON'T HAVE PEOPLE START 
DRINKING IT WITH THE HOPE TO 
DECREASE THEIR POSSIBILITY FOR 
DIABETICS.
>> BUT EVEN A POSSIBLE BENEFIT 
IS ONE MORE THING TO SAVOR.
FOR "GOOD MORNING AMERICA," JOHN
MCKENZIE, ABC NEWS, NEW YORK.
>> SO COFFEE CAN HAVE BENEFITS.
BUT WHAT ABOUT COFFEE VERSES 
TEA?
JOINING US NOW IS DR. DAVID 
KATZ, YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.
>> I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T HAVE 
RED BULL OUT HERE FOR THE 
COMPARISON.
>> NO ANTIOXIDANTS THERE.
ANTIOXIDANTS IN COFFEE ARE 
SOMEHOW HELPING WITH FOUR CUPS A
DAY?
>> FOR YEARS WE WERE BEATING UP 
ON COFFEE AND NOW STUDY AFTER 
SUDDENY -- STUDY IS SUGGESTING 
BENEFITS.
COFFEE IS ACTUALLY THE MOST 
POTENT SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS IN
SOME AMERICAN'S DIETS.
>> BUT IF YOU DRINK TOO MUCH, 
ARE YOU STILL RAISING YOUR BLOOD
PRESSURE, WHICH I THINK WAS THE 
RAP ABOUT COFFEE.
>> THEY'VE FOUND BENEFITS FOR 
SOME OF THESE HEALTH ISSUES BUT 
IT CAN RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE IF 
YOU'RE SUBJECT TO HEART PAL-PAGE
TATIONES.
>> IT TURNS OUT DIFFERENT KINDS 
OF TEA MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
BLACK TEA, GREEN TEE -- AND THE 
NEWCOMER, WHITE TEA.
>> WEIGHT TEA HAS THE HIGHEST 
CONCENTRATION OF ANTIOXIDANTS, 
FOLLOWED BY GREEN AND THEN BLACK
TEA AND ACTUALLY, COFFEE IS THE 
LOWEST ON THE LIST.
THORDER OF CAFFEINE 
CONCENTRATION IS JUST THE 
OPPOSITE.
HIGHEST FOR COFFEE, FOLLOWED BY 
BLACK, GREEN THEN WHITE TEA.
WHITE TEA GIVES YOU THE LEAST 
CAFFEINE, MOST ANTIOXIDANTS.
FOR HEALTH BENEFITS, IT MAY BE 
THE BEST OF THE BUNCH.
>> SO IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THE 
POTENT HEALTH IN THE MORNING, 
SWITCH TO WHITE TEA?
>> IF IT'S ALL ABOUT HEALTH, 
YES.
ON THE OTHER HAND, DRINK WHAT 
YOU LIKE.
I HAPPEN TO LIKE COFFEE -- 
>> NOW THAT WE KNOW COFFEE WON'T
HURT YOU.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> I KNOW YOU WANTED TO ISSUE A 
WARNING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH 
SOME OF THESE PACKAGED TEA 
BENCHES BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU'RE
GETTING ALL THE HEALTH BENEFITS 
AND IN FACT YOUE GETTING 
SUGAR?
>> IS THAT RIGHT.
ONE OF THE MISTAKES WE MAKE, IF 
WE CALL A FOOD SOMETHING, WE 
ASSUME WE KNOW WHAT THE HEALTH 
EFFECTS ARE.
ONCE YOU PROCESS THESE TEAS, A 
GREEN TEA WITH SUGAR IS NOT 
GOING TO CONFER THAT BENEFIT.
THIS GREEN TEA FROM SNAPPLE HAS 
MORE SUGAR IN THIS BOTTLE THAN 
IN THIS CHOCOLATE CANDY BAR.
SO YOU'RE TRADING AWAY THE 
HEALTH BENEFITS.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A 
HEALTH BENEFIT FROM CONSUMING 
ALL THAT SUGAR.
>> HERE IS A STATEMENT FROM SNAP
LE.
YOU COULD GO DIET, I GUESS, 
>> THEN YOU HAVE ARTIFICIAL 
SWEETENERS TO WORRY ABOUT.
IN ANY EVENT, IF YOU DRINK THE 
TEAS OR COFFEE IN THEIR NATIVE 
STATE, THERE ARE IMPORTANT 
HEALTH BENEFITS.

>> MIKE, THAT'S SO SWEET.
THANK YOU.
WE TURN TO OUR LATEST 
INSTALLMENT IN "G.M.A.'S" 
"G.M.A. SUMMER SURVIVAL GUIDE" 
SERIES.
WE ALL KNOW SUMMER CAN BE A 
LITTLE MESSY AND NOW KRISTIN VAN
OGTROP IS HERE TO TELL YOU HOW 
TO KEEP THE FAMILY SPOTLESS ALL 
SUMMER LONG.
>> YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM SPOTLESS 
BUT YOU CAN MAKE THEM SPOTLESS 
LATER.
>> YOU HAVE BASIC STAIN STUFF?
>> RIGHT.
THERE ARE THREE THINGS YOU NEED 
TO KNOW WHEN DEALING WITH PESKY 
SUMMER STAINS.
FIRST, TREAT THE STAIN 
IMMEDIATELY WHEN NECESSARY.
A COUPLE OF THESE STAINS WE'RE 
GOING TO SEE, YOU NEED TOAKE 
QUICK ACTION.
THE SECOND THING IS YOU DON'T 
EVER WANT TO DRY SOMETHING IN 
THE DRIER IF THE STAIN IS STILL 
THERE BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE DONE.
>> THAT'S IT.
>> THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.
THE THIRD THING, WHEN YOU'RE 
TREATING A STAIN, YOU REALLY 
WANT TO BLOT THE FABRIC.
DON'T RUB IT BECAUSE IT DAMAGES 
THE FABRIC.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC 
ONES.
GRASS STAINS.
>> THIS IS FAMILIAR, RIGHT?
>> SURE.
>> IMAGINE THESE ARE THE KNEES 
OF A PAIR OF WHITE JEANS, WHICH 
IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON 
SCENARIO.
WHEN YOU HAVE A GRASS STAIN, YOU
DON'T NEED TO TREAT IT RIGHT 
AWAY.
BUT WHEN YOU ARE READY TO 
LAUNDER THE GARMENT, TAKE 
SOMETHING LIKE SPRAY AND WASH 
AND GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT -- THIS
IS KIND OF A NO-BRAINER.
BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH GRASS 
STAINS AND SHOULD DO, IMAGINE 
THIS IS AN OLD TOOTH BRUSH.
YOU JUST WANT TO LIGHTLY GO LIKE
THIS.
>> I CAN SEE IT ALREADY!
>> THIS VIOLATES THE BLOTTING 
PRINCE PELL A LITTLE.
BUT DO IT REALLY LIGHT.
GRASS STAIN IS A PROTEIN STAIN, 
SO YOU NEED A DETERGENT THAT HAS
ENMES, SUCH AS TIDE.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
>> THERE YOU GO.
NOW, THIS CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM 
NEEDS TO EXPLANATION.
YOU REALLY BENEFIT BY TREATING 
THIS RIGHT AWAY.
EVEN IF YOU JUST HAVE COLD 
WATER.
SAY YOU'RE ON A PICNIC.
IF YOU HAVE SELTZER OR A BOTTLE 
OF WATER, DOUSE IT AS MUCH AS 
YOU CAN WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE A 
COMPLETE IDIOT.
>> ONCE WORSE, THE STAIN OR 
LOOKING LIKE -- 
>> ONE OR THE OTHER.
BUT THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE
LATER.
THEN TREAT IT WITH SOMETHING 
LIKE OXY CLEAN.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE 
VARIOUS BLEACHES IS SOMETHING 
WITH -- A CHLORINE BLEACH SUCH 
AS CLOROX IS FOR WHITES AND AN 
OXYGEN BLEACH SUCH AS OXY CLEAN 
OR SEVENTH GENERATION IS FOR 
COLORED FABRICS.
WE'RE USING OXY CLEAN HERE, 
WHICH WORKS VERY WELL -- WL, 
IT REALLY DOES WORK.
>> WE ALL NEED TO PUT ON SUN 
BLOCK AND SUNSCREEN AND STUFF 
LIKE THAT, BUT IT'S SO MESSY 
WHEN YOU GET IT ON YOUR FAVORITE
T.
>> OR ON YOUR BATHING SUIT.
THE PROBLEM WITH SUNSCREEN IS 
THEY'RE OILY.
SOMETHING THAT CAN REALLY HELP 
HERE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT THINK 
ABOUT IS A DISH WASHING 
DETERGENT BECAUSE THEY'RE 
DESUNED TO TAKE OUT GREASE.
FIRST YOU TAKE OFF THE CAP.
THEN JUST PUT ON A LITTLE BIT.
RUB IT IN GENTLY AND THEN SOAK 
IT AND THEN WASH IT AS YOU WOULD
NORMALLY.
>> THIS IS GREAT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS 
HAVING -- I MOON, YOU CAN SEE 
THAT LITTLE STAIN THAT THEY 
HAVE.
>> AND ANOTHER KEY IS TO TRY TO 
WASH IT IN AS HOT WATER AS 
POSSIBLE.
LOOK AT THE TAG TO SEE HOW HOT 
YOU CAN MAKE IT.
>> SURE.
>> FINALLY, KETCHUP.
LIKE THE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM, 
YOU'LL REALLY BENEFIT BY SOAKING
THIS IN WATER AS WELL AS SOON AS
YOU GET THE STAIN.
THENHAT YOU WANT TO DO, A 
REALLY NICE, MILD BLEACH 
ACTUALLY IS HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.
JUST PUT A LITTLE OF IT ON.
THE INVISIBLE HYDROGEN --

ORIGINALLY, I READ IT AS AN 
INDEPENDENT FILM.
WE MADE IT FOR FOR LIKE $1 
MILLION AND SOLD IT TO LIFETIME.
WHEN WE DID THAT, OUR HOPE WAS 
THAT THEY WOULD DO A MINISERIES.
ESPECIALLY FOR ME COMING OFF OF 
"LAW & ORDER" AND BEING VERY 
STOIC AND VERY CONTROLLED, YOU 
KNOW, TO BE A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR
--

PLAYING YOUR HUSBAND SH
>> NO.

DID BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE
I'M READING IT AND I'M THINKING 
-- YOU KNOW, WHO IS THIS PERSON?
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO THE CAST WAS.
I DIDN'T -- YOU KNOW, I JUST 
REALLY LIKED MY CHARACTER AND 
THE WHOLE PREMISE OF IT.
WHEN THEY SAID YOU WERE DOING 
IT, I THOUGHT YOU HAD CHOSEN TO 
DO IT TO PLAY MY HUSBAND.
TONY: IF I -- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU 
WERE DOING IT.
BUT I -- I WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY 
CAMPAIGNED FOR ANOTHER PART.
>> SURE.
TONY: ABSOLUTELY.

INTERESTING.

PLUG.
IT IS PRETTY GOOD 
>> BUT I AM GOING TO GO TO "LAW

TONY: DO YOU THINK IT MAKES IT'S
EASIER OR DOES IT MAKE IT HARDER
TO DO --
>> I TALK TO SAM WATERSTON AND 
FRED A LOT.
THEY ARE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.
THEY WERE GREAT MENTORS.
THEY TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT 
ACTING.

TONY: START EATING AN APPLE.
[APPLAUSE]
TONY: NO.
OK.
WHAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION?
I'M THROWN A LITTLE BIT.
>> OH, NO.
TONY: DOES YOUR -- DOES YOUR 
STINT ON "LAW & ORDER" EVER GET 
YOU OUT OF JAMS WITH THE POLICE?
LIKE A TICKET OR SOMETHING?
>> THAT'S SO FUNNY.
OF COURSE NOT.
THEY ARE SO -- IT IS PERSONAL.
YOU ARE SPEEDING ALONG.
YOU KNOW.
YOU GET STOPPED BY A COP BECAUSE
YOU ARE GOING THREE MILES ABOVE 
THE SPEEDING LIMIT.
THEY LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE A 
DISAPPOINTMENT.
BECAUSE YOU WERE A REP TESTIFY 
OF THE -- REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
LAW AT ONE POINT IN YOUR ACTING 
CAREER.
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER, LIZ.
TONY: IS THAT WHAT THEY SAY?
>> YEAH.
I HAVEN'T BEEN STOP THAD OFTEN, 
MOM, WHEREVER YOU ARE.
BUT YEAH, THEY -- THEY DON'T 
CARE.
THEY WILL WRITE YOU A TICKETED 
FOR MORE.
TONY: THAT'S TRUE.
A LOT OF TIMES YOU TRUE TRY TO 
SAY IT IS NOT ME.
YOU KNOW.
THE MINIMUM THEY SEE YOU THEY 
THINK YOU ARE TRYING TO GET OUT 
OF IT.

OPPOSITE.
I'M LIKE -- IT IS TRUE.
I'M SORRY.

I HAVE THE FACTS.
TONY: NOW, LET ME ASK YOU.
YOU HAD A TOUGH UPBRINGING, AM I
RIGHT?
YOU WERE LIKE A --
>> I FORGOT TO TELL YOU 
SOMETHING.
YEAH.
TONY: WHAT?
>> WHERE WE ARE SHOOTING OUR 
MOVIE IS VERY -- VERY CLOSE TO 
WHERE I SPENT SOME OF MY 
TROUBLED YOUTH AT A JUVI HALL.
IT IS TWO MINUTES AWAY.
TONY: WE ARE GOING TO BE IN 
SARATOGA SPRINGS.
>> SHOULD WE VISITED TOGETHER?
TONY: THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE IN 
A JUVENILE HOME?
>> I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
TONY: JUST LIKE "LAW & ORDER."
YOU CAN VISITED -- VISIT THEM.
WHAT WERE YOU IN JUVENILE HALL 
FOR?
>> MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.
MY FATHER WAS KIND OF NOT 
PRESENT.
YOU KNOW, I GUESS I WAS JUST 
VERY ANGRY AND VERY SIMILAR TO 
MY FILL ROLE IN "THE 
NEGOTIATOR."
MY MOM WAS A SINGLE MOM WITH ME.
THAT'S A VERY TIGHT BOND WHEN 
YOU ARE A SINGLE PARENT.
IF ANY OF YOU, YOU KNOW, RELATE 
TO THAT.

MILLION MILES AND RUBBED ELBOWS

WELCOME MARK STEINES.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

TONY: IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE 
GOING TO WORK.
>> I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LONG 
INTERVIEW.
THIS IS FOR YOU.
THIS IS FOR YOU.
TONY: ME?
>> BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, I HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE.
I COME WITH GIFTS.
WHEN YOU COME TO SOME ONE'S 
HOUSE, YOU COME WITH GIFTS.
I KNOW IT IS AROUND HERE 
SOMEWHERE.
TONY: IS IT UNDER HERE?
>> HERE WE GO.
OK.
WE HAVE A LITTLE HISTORY 
TOGETHER.
TONY: THIS IS GREAT.
>> TONY WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY 
OF DUBUQUE WHERE I GREW UP.
WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF STORIES 
ABOUT YOU.
TONY: REALLY?
>> TO KICK IT OFF, I GOT YOU A 
MUG.
TONY: U.D. MUG.
>> WE GOT A T-SHIRT.
T-SHIRT.
THE WEATHER IS GETTING A LITTLE 
COLD.
I GOT YOU A SWEATSHIRT.
PLUS APPLAUSE 
TONY: LET ME JUST SAY -- I WENT 
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF DUBUQUE IN 
IOWA.
BY THE WAY, LANDED THERE IN 
1968.
I GOT THERE -- FROM NEW YORK, 
LANDED IN DUBUQUE, IOWA, IN 
1968.
IT WAS A BIT OF A CULTURE SHOCK.
THERE WAS NO CONCRETE.
WE LANDED IN A CORNFIELD.
IT WAS AMAZING.
LAST YEAR -- LAST SUMMER THEY 
GAVE ME AN HONORARY DOCK TRAIT.
THERE WAS AN AMAZING THING TO GO
BACK.
FIRST OF ALL, ALL THE STUDENTS 
THAT WERE THERE, ALL MY FRIENDS 
WHEN THEY HEARD I WAS GETTING A 
A DOCTORATE THEY WENT WHAT?
IT IS A WONDERFUL SCHOOL.
I SAY HELLO TO MY FRIENDS AT 
DUBUQUE.
>> I MADE SOME PHONE CALLS.
I HOOKED YOU UP.
TONY: THANKS.
THERE'S MORE.
>> THERE'S MORE.
TONY: I LOVE THIS.
THIS IS GREAT.
>> FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T GRADUATE
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DUE BUICK
YOU CAN STILL GO THERE AND GET 
YOUR DUBUQUE HAM.
TONY: YES.
[APPLAUSE]
>> 
TONY: LEAN.
>> PLUMPERS.
>> THEN YOU'VE GOT THE 
OLD-FASHIONED FRANKS.
TONY: OH, MAN.
[APPLAUSE]
TONY: I APPRECIATE THIS.
>> DUBUQUE MEATS.
TONY: I KNEW THIS TABLE WOULD 
COME IN HANDY.
>> IT IS A REFRIGERATOR.
TONY: MEAT PACKING TOWN.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
MY DAD WORKED AT JOHN DEER.
WE HAD A LOT OF JOHN DEERE 
STUFF.
UP TO THAT POINT I THOUGHT NEW 
YORK WAS THE NORM.
IT GAVE ME ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE.
>> WE KEPT WONDERING IF YOU LOST
A BET.
TONY: NO.
THERE WAS A TERRIFIC RECRUITER.
HIS NAME WAS PETE HILE.
HE GOT A LOT OF GUYS FROM NEW 
YORK TO GO THERE.
IT WAS THE FARM GIRLS WAS THE 
PITCH.
I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT.
IT ENDED UP BEING A GREAT TIME.
>> SETTLE THIS FOR ME.
THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES IN 
TOWN ABOUT YOU.
TRUE OR FALSE?
REAL OR RUMOR?
TONY: TRUE.
>> DID YOU AND A BUNCH OF 
BUDDIES GO TO THE TOWN FOUNTAIN 
AND POUR MR. BUBBLE INTO THE 
FOUNTAIN AND IT CAUSED A BIG -- 
TONY: YOU KNOW -- HYPOTHETICALLY
-- IF THIS HAPPENED, WHAT 
HAPPENED WAS THERE WAS -- A NEW 
MALL, KENNEDY MALL.
>> YES.
TONY: IT WAS -- ACROSS.
AND THE STORES DOWN EEVEP SIDE N
THE MIDDLE WAS A GIANT FOUND 
TANG, UNBELIEVABLE FOUNTAIN.
SOMEHOW -- FOUNTAIN.
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT SOME BUBBLE
BATH GOT IN.
SOME REALLY HIGH-POWERED BUBBLE 
BATH.
IT WAS WILD.
IT MADE A WALL OF BUBBLES GOING 
DOWN THE -- DOWN THE MALL.
[APPLAUSE]
>> SEE.
TONY: IT WAS GREAT.
COLLEGE.
YOU KNOW.
THOSE COLLEGE -- GASH OLD 
COLLEGE DAYS 
>> THAT STORY STILL LIVES.
TONY: BOBBY WAS WITH ME.
>> YOU ADMIT TO IT.
TONY: NO, NO.
I'M SAYING HYPOTHETICALLY THAT 
WOULD HAPPEN.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
10 YEARS DOING ANYTHING ON TV IS
-- IT IS MONUMENTAL.
LET'S BE HONEST.
YOU ARE THERE 10 YEARS AT 
"ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT."
YOU HAVE BEEN THE ANCHOR THE 
LAST TWO.
AM I RIGHT?
>> I'M IN MY SECOND SEASON AS 
THE HOST.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
TONY: HOW DID YOU GET THE JOB?
BY THE WAY, YOU ALWAYS WANT TO 
BE THIS KIND OF --
>> I -- ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO BE
A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER.
YOU KNOW, THAT WENT OUT.
AND THEN THAT WENT OUT AND THAT 
WENT OUT.
TONY: I'M 55.
I WOKE UP WITH INJURIES THIS 
MORNING.
>> YOU DID.
I SAW.
SO -- YOU KNOW, IT IS A JOB YOU 
KIND OF WAKE UP ONE MORNING 
GOING HOW DID I GET THERE?
YOU LOOK AIN'T ROUND AND 
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU IS.
IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT 
CHANGES EVERY DAY.
I TRAVEL A LOT WITH MY JOB.
I GET TO MEET THE FUN 
CELEBRITIES.
STILL, MY PARENTS TODAY KIND OF 
-- THEY ARE GETTING BETTER AT 
IT.
THEY USED TO WATCH THE SHOW.
YOU KNOW, THEY ONLY KNEW -- 
PORTER WAGNER OR BUCK OWENS MUCH
ANYBODY ON HEE HAW.
THEY ARE LIKE HOW COME YOU ARE 
NOT GETTING CHARLEY PRIDE ON THE
SHOW, MARK?
NOW MY MOM IS CALLING ME GOING 
WHAT'S UP WITH NICK AND JESS?
ARE THEY TOGETHER?
ARE THEY SPLIT?
TONY: THAT POINTS TO SOMETHING.
WE ARE AS A SOCIETY -- WE ARE 
JUST -- WE ARE CRAZED ABOUT 
CELEBRITY INFORMATION.
YOU ARE ON -- YOU ARE ON THE 
FRONTLINE OF THAT.
I WONDER WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT US 
THAT THERE'S -- SO MUCH OF IT 
THAT THAT'S OUR MAIN INTEREST 
ALMOST.
DO YOU THINK MAYBE IT IS A 
DIVERSION BECAUSE THERE'S SO 
MUCH BAD STUFF GOING ON?
>> IT COULD BE.
YOU KNOW, WHEN KATRINA HIT, I 
WAS SENT DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS AND
COVERED IT.
WE REALLY -- WE GO OUTSIDE OF 
THE TRADITIONAL ENTERTAINMENT 
TONIGHT SCOPE.
WE START THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE
BOX.
WE HAVE DONE THIS FOR YEARS.
WE GO BEYOND THAT STORY OF, YOU 
KNOW, WHO IS GETTING PREGNANT 
AND HAVING A BY BY AND STARTING 
A FAMILY.
HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE 
ENTERTAINMENT WORLD AND, 
THEREFORE, OTHER LIVES, TOO.
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
AFFECTED BY THAT.
WE -- WE LOOK AT IT THAT 
PERSPECTIVE.
IT HELPS THE SHOW BROADEN ITS 
APPEAL.
TONY: DO YOU -- DO YOU EVER GET 
MISTAKEN FOR TOM CRUISE?
I MEAN, RIGHT?
IF HE JUMPS UP ON THE COUCH, I 
HAVE HIM HERE.
THERE IT IS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TONY: THAT REALLY LOOKED LIKE 
HIM.
THAT WAS WILD.
>> I ALMOST FELL OFF AND KILLED 
MYSELF.
BACK IN 1988 I WAS COVERING A 
CONVENTION AND I GUESS THIS GOES
BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW 
I GOT STARTED IN THE BUSINESS.
I WAS MISTAKEN FOR TOM CRUISE.
AND IT WAS BACK THEN I -- HI A 
LITTLE BIT MORE SIMILARITY.
BUT, YEAH, THE NEXT THING I KNOW
"ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT" SHOWS UP
AND THEY ARE LIKE -- WHERE'S TOM
CRUISE?
I KNOW YOU HAVE HIM.
WE ARE LIKE WAIT, WAIT, WE JUST 
HAVING FUN WITH THIS.
THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M ON 
THE SHOW AND -- AS FEATURED AS 
THIS FUN STORY.
TONY: BEING MISTAKEN FOR TOM 
CRUISE WAS THE WAY --
>> THE WAY TO GO.
THAT'S THE WAY TO GO.
YES.
TONY: ONE OTHER THING NOW.
YOU ARE ON THE -- YOU ARE ON THE
FRONT LINES OF COVERING 
CELEBRITY BREAKUPS BECAUSE 
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM.
YET, YOU JUST CELEBRATED A BIG 
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
>> YES.
10, 10 YEARS.
TONY: YES.
I THINK YOU ALSO -- THE AUDIENCE
MAY KNOW WHO YOUR WIFE IS.
>> LEE AN ZSA -- LEEANZA 
CORNETTE, FORMER MISS AMERICA.
WE WERE COMING OUT OF A 
RESTAURANT IN L.A.
SHE GETS RECOGNIZED ALL THE 
TIME.
USUALLY THEY JUST COME RIGHT UP 
TO HER AND SAY THIS GUY CAME UP 
AND -- HE SAID, YOU ARE LEEANZA 
ON.
IF YOU MARRIED TONY DANZA YOU 
WOULD BE LEEANZA DANZA.
THE KEY IS YOU REALLY HAVE TO 
WORK AT THE RELATIONSHIPS.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW TO CAST 
JUDGMENT ON PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD.
BUT THE TURNOVER RATE IS SO 
HIGH.
TONY: YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED.
WE HEAR ABOUT THE ONES THAT 
BREAK UP.
BETWEEN DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE 
ONES THAT DON'T BREAK UP.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
TONY: THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I GET GUYS ON THE SHOW ALL TIME,
MARRIED 30 YEARS, 10 YEARS.
I THINK THERE'S HOPE FOR US.
I HATE TO LET YOU GO.
>> THAT'S OK.
TONY: THANKS FOR THE STUFF.
I APPRECIATE IT.
AND MY MEAT.
"ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT," YOU 
HAVE TO CHECK YOUR LOCAL 
LISTINGS.
MARK STEINES, THANK YOU.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
RIGHT BACK.
>> NEXT WEEK,
TONY: ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME BACK.
EVERY MORNING BEFORE THE SHOW I 
LIKE TO ENTERTAIN MY STAFF WITH 
A DIDDY ON THE TRUMPET.
THEY LOVE IT.
THEY LOVE IT.
ESPECIALLY THE REALLY LONG LOUD 
SORNINGS.
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD PLAY A GAME 
WE LIKE TO CALL NAME THAT TONE 
DEAF.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
IF ONE OF OUR PLAYERS CAN NAME 
THE SONG I PLAY ON THE TRUMPET, 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE SONG 
BEFORE AND HAVE NOT PRACTICED 
AND I'M A BAD READER, TOO, THEY 
WILL WIN THIS TERRIFIC JAZZ BOX 
SET -- THIS IS GREAT.
ALMOST LOST SOME OF THE SET.
IF THEY DON'T, THEY WIN TONY'S 
-- MY C.D. ""BLOWING IN THE 
WIND."
LET'S MEET OUR FIRST PLAYER.
COME ON UP.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
>> JUDY.
TONY: NICE TO MEET YOU.
STAND BACK BECAUSE UNWANT TO GET
TOO CLOSE TO ME WHEN I START 
THIS HERE.
HOW'S THAT GO?
>> YOU ARE MAKING ME NERVOUS.
"
"[PLAYING "AMERICA THE 
BEAUTIFUL" 
>> FOR PURPLE MOUNTAIN 
I KNOW THE SONG.
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME.
TONY: YOU ARE GOING TO GET A 
BLOWING IN THE WIND.
>> "GOD BLESS AMERICA."
TONY: I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
YOU GOT THIS.
TONY'S BLOWING IN THE WIND.
IT IS "AMERICA THE
THANK YOU.
IT IS PROBABLY MY FAULT.
COME ON DOWN.
THIS REALLY IS MY NEXT VICTIM.
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME TURN THE PAGE.
DON'T LOOK.
DON'T BE LOOKING.
SEE IF CAN YOU GET THIS ONE NOW.
[PLAYING "DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL."
>> "I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN 
FRANCISCO."
TONY: I'M REALLY BAD.
DO YOU FOE WHAT IT WAS?
>> "DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL."
>> I KNEW HERS.
TONY: "BLOWING IN THE WIND."
NEXT VICTIM.
I THOUGHT I PLAYED THAT ONE 
PRETTY WELL.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
>> DEBORAH MEDINA.
TONY: HOW ARE YOU?
>> GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?
TONY: I'M FINE.
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
JEEZ.
WHAT'S THAT?
OH.
[PLAYING "O SOLE MIO"]
[APPLAUSE]
TONY: IT IS "O SOLE MIO."
YOU DIDN'T KNOW, DID YOU?
>> YEAH, I DID.
TONY: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A PART OF ME 
-- INSTEAD OF GIVING YOU THIS I 
WANT TO GIVE YOU THIS.
>> OK.
TONY: NO.
HOLD.
ON WOULD YOU HOLD THAT FOR ME?
THANK YOU.
HERE IS YOUR "BROGUE IN THE 
WIND."
I WILL GIVE THANK YOU JAZZ THING

ANNOUNCER: IT'S TUESDAY, JUNE
27.
COMING UP LIVE ON "THE VIEW"
>> GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING.
TOMORROW IS THE END OF AN ERA,
AND CHARLES GIBSON IS TELLING
THE LADIES THE TOUGHEST PART
ABOUT SAYING GOODBYE TO "GOOD
MORNING AMERICA."
PLUS, A MARRIED DOCTOR WHO HAS
FATHERED NINE CHILDREN AS A
SPERM DONOR IS REVEALING WHY HE
KEEPS ON GIVING THE GIFT OF
LIFE.
AND ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL IS
REVEALING HOW "THE DEAD ZONE"
GAVE HIM A NEW OUTLOOK ON
LIFE.
ALL THAT AND THE "HOT TOPICS"
YOU WANT TO HEAR COMING UP LIVE
ON "THE VIEW"!
[CLOSED CAPTIONING PROVIDED BY 
ABC, INC.,
AND JOHNSON & JOHNSON, WHERE 
QUALITY HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS 
HAVE BEEN A TRADITION FOR 
GENERATIONS] 
>> GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
WELCOME TO "THE VIEW"!
THANK YOU.
WE LOVE THIS SHOW TODAY.
FIRST OF ALL, OUR COLLEUE, 
CHARLIE GIBSON, IS WITH US.
TOMORROW IS HIS LAST DAY AFTER 
19 YEARS ON "GOOD MORNING 
AMERICA."
I LOVE CHARLIE.
>> HE'S MY MOM'S FAVORITE ANCHOR
IN THE BUSINESS.
>> MY AUNT JULIE, TOO.
SHE THINKS -- WHAT'S THE NAME OF
THAT SHOW?
>> "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT."
>> CHARLIE, IF YOU'RE IN THE 
GREEN ROOM LISTENING TO US, OUR 
KISSES.
WE ALSO HAVE A DOCTOR WHO HAS 
DONATED HIS SPERN ANONYMOUSLY 
AND FATHERED AT LEAST NINE 
CHILDREN.
>> NOT ANONYMOUS ANYMORE.
>> BUT WOULD YOU TELL YOUR CHILD
IF HE WERE CONCEIVED BY A SPERM 
DONOR?
AND WOULD YOU WANT THE CHILD TO 
MEET THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER?
>> I THINK SO.
>> AT WHAT PAGE?
>> YES, YOU WOULD DO IT, AND 
YES, YOU WOULD TELL, AND YES YOU
WOULD WATT THEM TO MEET?
>> YES.
>> WHAT IF YOU WERE MARRIED TO 
ANOTHER MAN?
>> YOU MEAN YOU GOT THE SPERM 
DONATIONHILE YOU WERE MARRIED 
TO SOMEONE ELSE?
>> BEFORE.
>> OR EVEN WHILE YOU WERE.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN SECRETS.
I BELIEVE YOU TELL THE TRUTH.
CHILDREN PICK UP THINGS ANYWAY.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE TO THE 
CHILD?
>> WHAT IF HE WANTS TO FIND THE 
FATHER?
WHAT DO YOU THINK, STAUR?
>> EVEN WHEN WE USE THE LANGUAGE
"THE FATHER" DASH 
>> BIOLOGICAL FATHER.
THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER IS 
CONNECTED THROUGH GENETIC 
MATERIAL.
IF THE OFFSPRING WANTS TO FIND 
THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER, THAT 
BIOLOGICAL FATHER MIGHT NOT WANT
AN EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP THAT 
CONNECTS THE CHILD AND THAT'S 
WHY THESE ISSUES BRING UP OTHER 
PROBLEMS IN THE LONG RUN.
>> AND IT'S A CONCERN, TOO, IF 
IT'S A SITUATION WHERE THE CHILD
HAS A FATHER FIGURE AND A DAD, 
HE MAY NOT FEEL THAT STRONG 
DESIRE TO GO FIND THIS PERSON.
>> THAT HAPPENS IN GENERAL WITH 
ADOPTED CHILDREN.
>> WHAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT 
FIGURE IN ARTHUR LIVES AND 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THAT 
CONNECTION AND THE DONOR DOESN'T
WANT IT?
>> YOU NEED THE GENETIC 
INFORMATION.
>> BUT WHAT IF THE BIOLOGICAL 
FATHER -- 
>> THE DONOR.
>> THE BIOLOGICAL DONOR.
THIS MAN HAS FATHERED NINE 
CHILDREN.
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T WANT THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OR THE 
CONNECTION?
>> HE HAS A CHILD OF HIS OWN 
NOW.
>> DOES HE HAVE AN OBLIGATION, 
JOY, DO YOU THINK?
>> I DO.
>> REALLY?
>> I DO BELIEVE THAT.
I THINKLL CHILDREN SHOULD KNOW
EVERYTHING.
>> THEN THERE PROBABLY WOULD BE 
NO DONORS.
>> BELIEVE ME, THERE WILL BE 
ENTY OF DONORS.
THEY NEED THE MONEY.
>> THERE IS A DIFFENCE BETWEEN
JUST A GENERAL DONOR AND THIS 
ONE.
>> AS LONG AS THERE IS A 
"PLAYBOY" MAGAZINE, THERE WILL 
BE A DONOR!
[APPLAUSE]
>> YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN MORE 
ABOUT THIS DONOR BECAUSE THE 
REASON HE WAS SO POPUL, HE WAS
A DOCTOR, A MEDICAL STUDENT AT 
THE TIME, HE WAS IERESTED IN 
WORKING WITH CHILDREN.
THIS MAN IS 6'2", BLONDE HAIR, 
BLUE EYES, AND HIS FAVORITE 
MOVIES ARE EVERYTHING FROM 
ACTION TO GENTLE CHICK FLICKS.
FROM A WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE, 
THAT'S MY BABY DADDY.
>> HIS FAVORITE MOVIE IS "SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN" BUT THEN HE LISTED
SARAH MCLACHLAN -- 
>> WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO 
WITH IT?
I WILL NOT HAVE YOUR CHILD 
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOUROVIE!
>> BUT DON'T WE FEEL DIFFERENTLY
ABOUT SPERM DONORS THAND EGG 
DONORS?
THERE IS A DIFFERENT 
CONNOTATION.
>> BECAUSE SPERM DONATION IS 
FUN.
EGG DONATION IS NOT.
THAT'S WHY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THAT'S THE REASON.
>> YOU'RE ABILITY TO BREAK IT 
DOWN ALWAYS IMPRESSES ME.
THAT'S WHY HE'S DOING IT.
WE'LL TALK TO HIM LATER.
THERE IS A B CONTROVERSY 
RAGING SINCE LAST TUESDAY NIGHT 
WHEN THE SHOW "RESCUE ME" AIRED.
THE FIREFIGHTER IS PLAYED BY 
DENIS LEARY AND IN THE EPISODE 
HE SEXUALLY FORCED HIMSELF ON 
HIS ESTRANGED LIFE AND LEFT 
WITH, THEY SAY, AN COMPRESSION 
OF TRIUMPH.
LEGALLY, IF A WOMAN SAYS MY 
HUSBAND RAPED ME, CAN SHE BRING 
CHARGES?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BECAUSE THE ASSAULT IS THE EXACT
SAME.
IF A WOMAN SAYS NO AND YOU FORCE
YOURSELF, IT IS RAPE.
>> EVEN IF IT'S YOUR HUSBAND?
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.
>> FAT CHANCE OF WINNING THAT 
CASE.
>> IT'S A VERY SIMILAR SITUATION
TO DATE RAPE.
YOU MIGHT BE DATING SOMEBODY AND
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD AN INTIMATE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM SEVERAL 
TIMES OVER SEVERAL MONTHS OR 
YEARS AND THAT PERSON COMES TO 
YOUR DORM ROOM DRUNK AND SAYS 
WE'RE HAVING SEX, YOU SAY NO, HE
FORCES HIMSELF, IT'S RAPE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
YOU DID IT BEFORE.
>> BUT THEN THE PROBLEM IS, 
WHETHER IT'S DATE RAPE OR THE 
HUSBAND, THEY SAY SHE WANTED IT.
>> THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT.
>> BUT IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S 
A WIFE.
I WOULD THINK IT'S HARDER.
>> AND IN THIS PARTICULAR STORY 
LINE, SHE SEEMED TO AT THE END 
SHOW PLEASURE AND THAT'S 
SOMETHING THAT WOMEN HAVE BEEN 
VERY ANGRY ABOUT BECAUSE IT 
SENDS A DOUBLE MESSAGE.
GUYS WALK AROUND GOING THEY ALL 
WANT IT ANYWAY.
>> SHE LIKED IT.
>> YEAH.
SO IT GIVES PEOPLE RATIONAL FOR 
USING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
CONNECTED TO SEXUALITY.
REMEMBER LUKE AND LAURA ON 
"GENERAL HOSPITAL."
>> THAT WAS A WHILE AGO.
>> IT WAS.
BUT THAT WAS ONE TIME WHEN -- 
>> THEY'RE IN A NURSING HOME AT 
THIS POINT.
HOW LONG AGO WERE LUKE AND LAURA
ON TELEVISION?
>> EVEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
WATCHING "GONE WITH THE WIND."
>> BUT HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS 
THAT?
>> I WAS IN SECOND GRADE.
MY BABYSITTER USED TO BRIBE ME 
WITH GUNMAN TO WATCH LUKE AND 
LAURA.
>> SHE WATCHED THE WEDDING AND 
YOU GOT BRIBED.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I GOT TWO PACKS OF GUM.
>> THE VERY FIRST ENCOUNTER, HE 
RAPES HER IN A NIGHTCLUB, AS I 
RECALL.
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY 
FALL IN LOVE, ALL THE WOMEN IN 
AMERICA ARE IN LOVE WITH LUKE 
WITH THE CURLY BLONDE HAIR.
>> BUT THERE WAS NOT THE KIND OF
ANGER THAT THERE IS NOW.
>> THERE ACTUALLY WAS AT THE 
TIME.
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST 
CONTROVERSIAL THINGS.
IT'S REALLY WHAT SEPARATED ABC 
SOAPS FROM THE OTHERS.
IT BROUGHTP ISSUES LIKE THIS.
"ALL MY CHILDREN" WITH ABORTION 
AND EVERYING EARLY ON.
>> BUT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN IT 
WOULD BE TODAY.
EVERYBODY LOVED THEM, I MEAN, 
THE WEDDING.
>> IS THERE AN OBLIGATION 
HUSBAND TO WIFE TO HAVE SEX?
>> NO.
>> IF ONE WANTS IT AND THE OTHER
DOESN'T -- 
>> NO.
WHAT'S CENTURY IS THAT?
>> NO, NO, NO.
THERE IS DEFINITELY AN INTIMATE 
-- YOU MAKE A PROMISE, I AGREE 
WITH THAT.
I DO.
I AGREE WITH THAT.
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO
FORCE ANYBODY.
THAT'S WRONG.
>> IF ONE PERSON DOESN'T WT TO
DO IT, YOU DON'T DO IT.
>> I AGREE.
>> IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO, UNLESS
YOU'RE THE SPERM DOCTOR.
THEN HE'S THE ONLY ONE TANG OGE.
>> IT DEPENDS ON SOCIETY.
>> BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
MARRIAGE IS NOT SLAVERY.
A WOMAN GOES INTO A MARRIAGE 
BECAUSE SHE SUPPOSEDLY IS IN 
ROMANTIC LOVE WITH THE GUY, NOT 
BECAUSE HE HAS RIGHTS SHE 
DOESN'T HAVE.
>> NO.
BUT YOU COMMITMENT TO A CERTAIN 
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'LL HAVE 
SEX.
>> BUT IF ONE DOESN'T WANT TO DO
IT, DOES THE OTHER HAVE TO DO 
IT?
UNLESS YOU CAN COAX SOMEBODY 
ANALYZE WITH CANDLES, 
MEDICATION, ALCOHOL.
[LAUGHTER]
>> SCENTED CANDLES.
>> THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY 
NIGHTS CAN YOU HAVE A HEADACHE.
>> EXACTLY.
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE
OT TOPICS"!

YEARS NOW YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
ME.
LET'S GO TO "HOT TOPICS," GUYS.
SERIOUS.
THIS IS OUR SHOW AND THE THING 
I'VE LOVED DOING FOR NINE YEARS

BUT I CAN'T JUST SAY, OH, THANKS
A LOT AND LET'S MOVE ON.
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY -- YOU KNOW.
WE'VE HEARD RUMORS, WE'VE READ 
RUMORS.
THIS IS A SURPRISE THAT THIS 
CAME ABOUT THIS WAY.
WE DID NOT EXPECT IT.
BUT I HAVE TO Y THIS.
FROM THE DAY YOU CAME ON THIS 
PROGRAM, I CANNOT IMAGINE "THE 
VIEW" BEING THE SUCCESS THAT IT 
HAS BEEN WITHOUT YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> WITHOUT THE KIND OF WORK 
YOU'VE DONE, WITHOUT YOUR 
INTELLIGENCE AND YOUR HUMOR.
WE HAVE SEEN YOU EVOLVE.
YOU ARE A GREAT LADY AND 
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO, I 
KNOW THAT YOU AND AL HAVE TALKED
ABOUT IT AND YOU FEEL IT IS THE 
BEST FOR YOU.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO BE SO SUCCESSFUL.
ANYBODY WOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO 
HAVE YOU AND IT IS MY JOY THAT 
WE HAVE HAD YOU FOR NINE YEARS.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BARBARA.
>> AND MY SADNESS THAT IT'S 
TURNED OUT THIS WAY.
BUT WHATEVER IS BEST FOR YOU IS 
WHAT I WANT, WHAT WE ALL WANT 
MOST FOR YOU.
YOU HAVE BEEN SUCH A PART OF 
THIS SHOW.
>> THANK YOU.
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW "THE 
VIEW" WOULD BE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT
YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
ABSOLUTELY.
I APPRECIATE IT.
>> SHA I SPEAK?
>> YES, LET'S TALK.
>> JUST QUICKLY.
WE'LL GO OVER THIS AGAIN.
BUT WHO AM I GOING TO FIGHT WITH
NOW?
>> NOBODY.
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'LL HAVE 
SOMEBODY TO FIGHT WITH.
[APPLAUSE]
>> GOOD-NATURED FIGHTS.
>> STAR AND I HAVE HAD 
GOOD-NATURED FIGHTS ALL THE 
TIME, ABOUT RELION, ABOUT THE 
WAY YOU RAISE CHILDREN.
IT WAS IN THE PRESS THAT WE WERE
MAD AT EACH OTHER.
WE FOUGHT THE AIR, NOT OFF 
THE AIR.
>> THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY 
SMART WOMAN, JOY.
AND SITTING NEXT TO YOU -- 
>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.
THIS IS ABOUT YOU TODAY.
>> NO, IT IS ABOUT YOU.
>> WHEN I LEAVE, WE'LL TALK 
ABOUT ME.
>> PLEASE!
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
>> I HAVE ONE MORE THING TO SAY.
>> SURPRISE.
>> I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF 
YOU.
BUT SINCE YOU BECAME A SKINNY 
BITCH -- 
[APPLAUSE]
-- ITAS NOT BEEN THE SAME.
WE WERE SISTERS IN THE 
CHUBBINESS.
OK.
>> AND WE ALWAYS WILL BE.
>> I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHOSE 
SHOES I'M GOING TO GOVERNMENT 
NOW.
EVERY MORNING YOU WALK IN AND I 
LOVE YOUR SHOES.
YOU'RE A PLANNER AND YOU HAVE 
EVERYTHING IN THAT TRIO F OF 
YOURS.
YOU WILL HAVE GOOD THINGS 
HAPPEN.
>> IIS A NEW CHAPTER FOR STAR.
IT WILL BE A NEW CHAPTER FOR 
"THE VIEW" IN THE FALL AND I'M 
SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO 
HAVE A VERY HAPPY CHAPTER.
>> EVERYTHING CHANGES.
THINGS DON'T STAY THE SAME.
THAT'S WHAT WE LEARNED HERE THIS
YEAR.
>> INSIDE OF EVERY OBSTACLE IS 
AN OPPORTUNITY.
>> ONE DOOR CLOSES, ANOTHER 
SLAMS IN YOUR FACE, THAT'S WHAT 
I ALWAYS SAY.
[APPLAUSE]
>> YOU SPRUNG THAT ON US, 
THOUGH.
>> I'M IN SHOCK.
I'M TRYING TO CATCH MY BREATH 
HERE.
>> COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET'S DO OR SHOW!
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME.
WE HAVE A BRAND NEW ANCHOR AT 
ABC.
>> IAS JUST ABOUT TO LEAD INTO
THAT.
THAT'S OK WITH ME.
YOU CAN LEAD IN AS LONG AS -- 
OH, HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO BE
WITH US?
>> WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY IN THE
MID JULY AND THEN TAKE SOME TIME
TO ENJOY "THE VIEW"!
>> I HOPE YOU'LL STAY WITH US AS
AS LONG AS YOU WILL.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> CHARLIE GIBSON ALSO HAS A NEW
LIFE COME UP.

LIKE IT OR NOT!

THIS IS SPRING TRAINING TIME.
THE PITCHERS AND CATCHERS AND 
ROOKS HAVE REPORTED AND YOU'RE 
LOOKING AT A RAW ROOKIE IN THIS 
BUSINESS TODAY.
>> WOW.
>> ISN'T HE CUTE?
THAT WAS CHARLES GIBSON IN 1987,
WHEN HE FIRST BEGAN WAKING UP 
MILLIONS OF US AS CO-HOST OF 
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA."
TOMORROW AFTER 19 YEARS HE SIGNS
OFF FOR THE LAST TIME.
HE'S THE NEW ANCHOR OF ABC 
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK CHARLES 
GIBSON!
[APPLAUSE]
>> A DAY OF CHANGES.
>> IHOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE
A TOUGH TIME FOLLOWING ALL THE 
SEX TALK THEY WERE DOING.
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE IS 
TAKES IT OFF ANOTHER WAY.
WHO HOLDS THE FUTURE?
>> GOD HOLDS THE FUTURE AND 
DIRECTS IT IN EVERY WHICH WAY I 
COULD IMAGINE.
>> BECAUSE YOU BUILT UP TO THAT 
AND NEVER ACTUALLY TOLD ME.
DO Y'ALL HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO 
ANNOUNCE?
>> WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU 
SOMETHING.
>> ARE YOU GOING ANYWHERE?
>> I'M DATING THE SPERM DONOR.
ARE YOU?
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
>> ARLENE, I HAVE TO TELL YOU 
ABOUT CHARLES AND ME.
DO YOU THINK THAT A WIFE OWES IT
TO HER HUSBAND TO GIVE HIM SEX.
>> WHEW!
BACK TO -- 
>> PLEASURE.
GOOD LUCK IN JULY.
ALL THE BEST.
BARBARA, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> CHARLIE, COME BACK!
[APPLAUSE]
>> LET'S GO BACK TO GOD AND THE 
FUTURE.
>> SERIOUSLY.
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE USED TO.
COME ON.
>> WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
>> I FORGOT IT.
>> OH, GOOD.
>> I LOVE YOU.
I'LL LET YOU OFF THE HOOK.
>> PLEASEET ME OFF THE HOOK.
>> BUT 90 YEARS -- 
>> DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW YOU 
TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF ON 
TELEVISION?
>> SHE WATCHES.
>> THIS IS WHAT WOMEN TALK ABOUT
WHEN THEY'RE ALONE WITHOUT MEN.
SOMETIMES WITH MEN.
>> YOU TALK ABOUT THIS ON "GOOD 
MORNING AMERICA."
THIS WOULD BE ONE OF YOUR 
SUBJECTS.
>> "AROUND THE WATERCOOLER," 
EXACTLY.
>> WELL, MAYBE THEY WILL WHEN 
YOU'RE GONE.
CHARLIE, HAS IT SUNK IN?
>> NO.
>> ARE YOU GOING T SAY, HEY, I 
CAN SLEEP LATE?
>> NO.
AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE END, YOU
GET INTO DENIAL.
I WAS LISTENING TO YOU TALK 
ABOUT THE STAFF AND THE PEOPLE 
THATOU WORK WITH EVERY DAY AND
YOU REALLY COME AFTER 19 YEARS 
TO LOVE THOSE FOLKS.
YOU DEPEND ON THEM.
I ALWAYS SAY THAT THE STAFF 
WORKS MUCH HARDER THAN I DO.
THEY WORK 22 HOURS A DAY AND AT 
7:00 THEY SAY TO YOU HERE IS MY 
WORK PRODUCT FOR THE DAY, DON'T 
SCREW IT UP.
>> THEY'RE AMAZING.
>> AND MAKE US PROUD.
AND YOU GET TO REPRESENT THEM IN
WHAT THEY DO AND YOU JUST COME 
TO HAVE AN TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
AFFECTION FOR EVERYBODY THERE.
AND THE KIDS WHO WORK ON 
"G.M.A." WORK SO HARD AND THEY 
WORK SO MANY -- I MEAN, JUST TO 
DO THIS STUFF, I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT'S, THIS GRAND CORE NATION.
SOMEBODY WROTE ME AN EMAIL THAT 
SAID ISN'T IT NICE TO HAVE ALL 
THOSE TRIBUTES BEFORE YOU DIE?
[LAUGHTER]
BUT ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCERS WE
HAVE, WITHOUT ASKING A QUESTION,
HE JUST WORKED RIGHT THROUGH THE
WEEKEND DOING STUFF AND NEVER A 
WORD OF COMPLAINT.
>> YOU ALSO MISS THE FAMILY PART
OF THE SHOW.
THAT I THINK WILL BE HARD FOR 
YOU.
>> YEAH.
>> YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE EVERY 
DAY.
THEY'RE LIKE YOUR FAMILY.
AND THE GERMANS CALLED THAT THE 
GEMENISCHAFT.
>> THE MINE SHAFT?
>> NO.
>> SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I'M IN 
A MINE SHAFT.
>> ARE WE GOING TO ADD A MAN TO 
THAT GROUP OR IS IT GOING TBE 
TWO WOMEN?
>> I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS GOING 
TO BE THREE WOMEN OVER THERE 
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE LEAVING.
NO, I THINK THERE WILL BE A MAN 
INTEGRATED INTO -- 
>> I READ THERE MIGHT NOT BE.
>> I THINK THERE ALMOST 
INEVITABLY WILL BE.
BUT IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION.
>> IS THERE ANYBODY YOU'D LIKE 
TO SEE SIT IN THAT SEAT?
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WHO WILL BE AS NEWS ANCHOR FOR A
WHILE.
BILL RITTER AND BILL WEER, THE 
WEEKEND ANCHOR FOR "GOOD MORNING
AMERICA," AND CHRIS CUOMO, I
THINK ALL OF THEM WILL BE DOING 
SOME OF IT.
>> YOU'VE BEEN A NEWS MAN EVEN 
BEFORE "GOOD MORNING AMERICA" 
AND -- I WORKED FOR ABC FOR 30 
YEARS.
STARTED WHEN I WAS 11.
>> SO DID I.
WE ARRIVED AROUND THE SAME TIME.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WE WERE JUST TODDLERS.
DOING "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT," HOW 
MUCH DID YOU WANT TO?
>> LISTEN.
TO COME BACK TO THAT FEELING OF 
FAMILY YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 
AND LOVING SOMETHING, WHEN YOU 
HAVE AS MUCH RESPECT FOR ALL THE
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR ABC NEWS, 
THERE'S HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
AROUND THE WORLD, AND YOU 
REALIZE WHEN YOU WORK ON "WORLD 
NEWS TONIGHT" -- WHEN I USED TO 
BE A CORRESPONDENT, IF YOU'RE 
NOT ON THE SHOW FOR TWO OR THREE
WEEKS, YOUR HANDS BEGIN TO SHAKE
AND YOU GET NERVOUS AND THINK 
THEY DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE.
I'D GO IN THE CONTROL ROOM AND 
WATCH AT 6:25 AT NIGHT BEFORE 
THE SHOW, THERE'S SEVEN OR EIGHT
PIECES FROM CORRESPONDENTS AND 
THEN AT 25 AFTER 6:00 IT'S NOT 
UNUSUAL THAT MAYBE FIVE OF THEM 
WON'T BE THERE YET BECAUSE 
EDITORS WORKING IN SYDNEY, 
AUSTRALIA OR IN FRANKFURT OR 
WHATEVER AND YOU REALIZE WHAT A 
TEAM EFFORT THIS IS AND HOW ANY 
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN TOTALLY 
SCREW UP THE SHOW.
SO YOU TEND TO HAVE A WONDERFUL 
FEELING OF TEAM IN ALL OF THAT 
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY WOULD LOVE TO 
BE THE CAPTAIN OF THAT TEAM OR 
TO REPRESENT THAT TEAM.
PETER WAS GOING TO BE ANCHOR FOR
LIFE.
NONE OF US QUESTIONED THAT.
I WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY, SATISFIED
WITH THE FACT THAT MY CAREER AT 
ABC WOULD END AS HOST OF "GOOD 
MORNING AMERICA" AND I LOVED 
THAT PROSPECT.
THEN WE GOT ROCKED TWICE BY 
REALLY UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, 
PETER'S ILLNESS AND THE INJURY 
TO BOB WOODRUFF.
SO, AS I SAID THE OTHER DAY, 
THEY LOOKED AROUND AND THE ONLY 
GUY STANDING NEXT TO THE CANDY 
MACHINE WAS ME.
>> THINGS CHANGE.
>> CHARLIE, ONE THING YOU DO 
BRING TO THE NEWSCAST AND 
EVERYBODY SAYS IS THERE IS A 
DEPTH OF NEWS, UNDERSTANDING AND
CONNECTION WITH THE VIEWER.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU DO IT.
>> HE HAS BEEN DOING IT.
>> BUT WHEN IT'SIS, IT'S GOING
TO BE REALLY GREAT.
>> I USED TO WATCH THE NEWS WITH
MY DAD EVERY EVENING AND MY ONLY
THEORY OF LIFE IS THAT YOU SPEND
YOUR LIFE TRYING TO PROVE TO 
YOUR PARENTS THAT YOU'RE WORTH A
DAMN.
SO I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE NEWS 
WITH HIM AND I'VE LOVED IT EVER 
SINCE.
>> WELL, YOU WERE WORTH A DAMN 
TO US, CERTAINLY TO ABC NEWS AND
YOU'RE WORTH A DAMN TO MILLIONS 
OF VIEWERS.
>> THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
>> THE LAST TIME CHARLIE AND I 
WENT OUT WE HAD A LIQUID LUNCH 
AND HE BOUGHT THE CHAMPAGNE.
NEXT TIME IT'S ON ME.
>> SHE TOOK ME OUT AND GOT ME --
>> YOU CAN SEE CHARLIE ON HIS 
LAST DAY ON "GOOD MORNING 
AMERICA" TOMORROW MORNING 
STARTING AT 7:00 A.M.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

E
>> WE'RE FROM GEORGIA.
A SPERM DONOR TO NINE BABIES 
WHEN "THE VIEW" RETURNS ON ABC!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> AS A CRITICAL CARE PEEDTRIGS,
DR. MATTHEW WILL DO EVERYTHING 
IN HIS POWER TO SAVE A CHILD'S 
LIFE, BUT HE'S ALSO A MAN WHO 
KEEPS ON GIVING THE GIFT OF 
LIFE.
HE HAS FATHERED AN ASTOUNDING 
NINE CHILDREN AS A SPERM DONER.
HE'S HERE WITH US TODAY WITH HIS
WIFE, NICOLE.
WELCOME TO "THE VIEW."
GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
MATTHEW, YOU'RE A CRITICAL CARE 
AND YOU HAVE SOME GREAT JOYS IN 
TREATING THEM.
YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED TO 
NICOLE.
SO, AS I UNDERSTAND, YOU WERE 
DONATING SPERM BEFORE YOU MET 
NICOLE AND YOU CONTINUED TO DO 
SO AFTER YOU GOT MARRIED.
TAKE US BACK.
WHY DID YOU WANT TO BE A SPERM 
DONER?
>> ODDLY ENOUGH, THE IDEA CAME 
FROM THE PARENT OF A PAY SHENT.
SHE HAD IDENTIFIED THAT THE 
CHILD WAS CONCEIVED DURING DONE 
ORE SPERM.
SHE JOKED THAT YOU SHOULD BE A 
SPERM DONER, AND I LAUGHED AND 
SAID SHE WASN'T JOKING.
I HAVE TO THANK HER FOR PLANTING
THE SEED -- 
[LAUGHTER]
>> TRULY UNINTENDED.
I WAS CLEARLY QUITE STUNNED WITH
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE CONFRONTED 
WITH FERTILITY ISSUES.
15% OF THOSE WHO TRY AREN'T 
SUCCESSFUL.
>> WE SPOKE ABOUT YOUR PROFILE 
DURING "HOT TOPICS."
ONCE YOU PUT IT OUT THERE WERE 
YOU SURPRISED AT HOW MANY 
RESPONSES YOU RECEIVED?
>> THERE ARE DONERS WHO HAVE 
DONATED MORE THAN I HAVE AND 
THOSE WHO HAVE DONATED LESS THAN
I HAVE.
I THINK DIFFERENT COUPLES AND 
WOMEN ARE LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT 
THINGS.
SOMEBODY WITH A CERTAIN NATIONAL
HERITAGE OR WHATEVER IT IS, 
DIFFERENT WOMEN ARE LOOKING FOR 
VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.
SO I THINK THE VARIETY IS HAVING
CHOICES IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
MAKING CHILDREN ISN'T BAKING A 
CAKE.
I THINK IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLEX.
>> WHAT ABOUT DOING IT FOR 
MONEY?
>> I STARTED DONATING, NOT EVEN 
BACK IN MEDICAL SCHOOL, I WAS A 
PHYSICIAN.
I'M A BLOOD DONER, IT SEEMED 
LIKE IF THERE'S SOMETHING OF A 
SURPLUS THAT I CAN HAVE -- 
[LAUGHTER]
>> TO SOMEBODY ELSE, WHY NOT 
HELP SOMEBODY IN NEED?
>> LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, YOU NOW 
KNOW THERE ARE AT LEAST NINE 
CHILDREN FOR WHOM YOU WERE THE 
BIOLOGICAL FATHER.
DO YOU FEEL, OR DO YOU FEEL AS 
HIS WIFE, THAT YOU OWE THESE 
CHILDREN A CONNECTION?
ARE RESPONSIBILITY?
JOY SAID THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE.
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT?
>> I THINK GETTING TO KNOW, AT 
LEAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MAYBE 
EVEN SOME SOCIAL HISTORY, THERE 
COULD BE PERSONALITY TRAITS THAT
A CHILD MAY HAVE THAT THEY WANT 
TO KNOW WHERE DOES THIS COME 
FROM.
I THINK IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE --
>> TO HAVE THE FACTS?
THE MAY YOU MIGHT WITH A --
>> THAT'S VERY GENEROUS NICOLE, 
BECAUSE THEY JUST GAVE BIRTH TO 
YOUR CHILD.
HOW OLD IS YOUR BABY?
>> THREE WEEKS AS OF YESTERDAY.
>> HE'S DORBLE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> DO YOU FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY?
A COLLECTION?
WHAT IS FUN OF THESE CHILDREN 
CALL AND SAY I NEED THIS OR 
THAT?
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
I THINK RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE
GENERATED IN A MUTUALLY 
CONSENTING WAY.
THE WAY DONATION, OF SPERM AND 
EGGS IS DONE TODAY, THERE'S VERY
LITTLE REGULATION OR 
PREPARATION.
NO COUNS SELLING FOR DONERS.
SO YOU GO INTO IT BLIND.
I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONATED 
--
>> YOU, YOU?
>> OH, WHAT DO I THINK?
>> FEEL.
>> I FEEL A PERSONAL OBLIGATION 
TO BE TRANSPARENT AND PROVIDE 
INFORMATION AND LET THE CHILDREN
SET THE PACE OF WHATEVER KIND OF
RELATIONSHIP MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT 
EVOLVE.
WHEN I GAVE, I GAVE IT WITH NO 
EXPECTATION OF THEIR EVER BEING 
A RELATIONSHIP OR EVER KNOWING 
THESE INDIVIDUALS.
BUT DIFFERENT CHILDREN FEEL 
DIFFERENTLY.
>> IF THEY COME TO YOU AND THEY 
WANT TO MEET YOU, MEET WHO YOU 
ARE -- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT 
THIS?
>> WELL I'M OPEN TO THE 
POSSIBILITY.
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT 
CASE BY CASE.
>> DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO DO THAT?
>> I THINK CHILDREN WHO ARE 
ADOPTED OR CONCEIVED THROUGH 
DONATION HAVE AS RIGHT TO MUCH 
INFORMATION AS THEY CAN HAVE.
>> SO YOU AGREE WITH ME?
>> NO, ACTUALLY -- HE'S SAYING 
TRANSPARENT SI AS IT RELATE TO 
INFORMATION, I DON'T HEAR AS IT 
RELATES TO A RELATIONSHIP --
>> OR SUPPORT.
>> IT SEEM TO INDICATE YOU TAKE 
IT AS IT COMES.
>> I THINK THAT'S HOW ALL HUMAN 
RELATIONSHIPS ARE.
YOU DON'T GO INTO YOU'RE FUTURE 
SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
RELATIONSHIP YOU DON'T YET KNOW.
>> WILL ARWIN KNOWS SHE HAS 
FAMILY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE VERY TRANSPARENT, OPEN AND
HONEST.
AND WE'LL CERTAINLY BE THAT WAY 
WITH ARWIN.
>> A HAPPY ENDING TO YOUR STORY,
TOO.
YOU HELPED SO MANY FAMILIES 
CREATE YOUR OWN FAMILY, BUT IN 
THE BEGINNING YOU HAD TROUBLE 
CONCEIVING?
>> IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT.
WE DID MISCARRY ONCE.
>> SO OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE FOR YOU
AND YOU SAID NOT NECESSARILY 
THAT THE SPERM COULD HAVE BEEN A
PROBLEM?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> ARE YOU STILL DOING THIS?
ARE YOU STILL CONTRIBUTING YOUR 
SPERM?
>> FUNNY ENOUGH --
>> THE PHONE IS RINGING WITH 
PEOPLE YOU WANT IT.
>> YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE SO 
SPEAK.
>> THE ONLY SPERM BANK IN 
MICHIGAN WON'T ACCEPT SPERM 
DONERS WHO HAVE DONATED 
PREVIOUSLY.
I HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH ANOTHER
ONE.
BUT I THINK IT'S ON THE BACK 
BURNER FOR NOW.
>> JOY WILL LOVE THIS -- SHE 
KEEPS SAYING HE'S CUTE.
HIS DONER NUMBER WAS 48 QUFRPBLT
A.H., WHICH STOOD FOR QUITE A 
HUNK.
OUR THANKS TO THEM.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANTHONY

GREAT JOB.
