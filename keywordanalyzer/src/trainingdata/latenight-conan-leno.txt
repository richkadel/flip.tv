RAPPER SNOOP DOGG TO DISCUSS 
PARDONING A GANG LEADER.
SNOOP ASKED ARNOLD TO CHANGE HIS
SENTENCE FROM THE DEATH PENALTY 
TO LIFE IN PRIZZLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THOUGHT THAT WAS WEIRD.
[ IMPERSONATING SCHWARZENEGGER ]
"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT IS THIS PRIZZLE?"
THEN HE ATE A SAUSAGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT TONIGHT'S SHOW.
WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT SHOW.
BIG FRIDAY SHOW -- UNLESS IT'S A
RERUN.
FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," 
WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE HER HERE,
TINA FEY ON THE PROGRAM.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SHE'S A MOMMY NOW.
QUITE FUNNY.
GLAD TO HAVE HER HERE.
OUR SECOND GUEST -- AT ONLY 
18 YEARS OLD HE'S MAKING HIS 
FILM DEBUT IN "THE CHRONICLES OF
NARNIA -- THE LION, THE WITCH 
AND THE WARDROBE."
WILLIAM MOSELEY IS ON THE SHOW.
[ APPLAUSE ]
YOUNG MAN.
I WISH HIM WELL.
AND THEN -- THRILLED ABOUT OUR 
MUSICAL GUEST TONIGHT.
JAMES BLUNT IS ON THE SHOW.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HE'S GREAT.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, 
MAX WEINBERG 
AND THE MAX WEINBERG 7.
>> Max: CONAN!
>> Conan: WE GOT THE SPIRIT 
GOING ON HERE IN MANHATTAN.
THE HOLIDAYS.
HOLIDAYS ARE A GREAT TIME TO BE 
IN NEW YORK.
A LOT OF YOU PEOPLE PROBABLY 
CAME HERE TO DO SOME SHOPPING.
STUFF LIKE THAT.
OKAY, MAYBE NOT.
[ CHEERS ]
NO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'RE HERE 'CAUSE IT'S COLD 
OUTSIDE.
NO, IT'S -- THIS IS THE TIME A 
LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO NEW YORK.
IT'S THE HOLIDAYS.
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE BIG TREE 
OUTSIDE.
IT'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.
WE SHOULD PAINT THE TREE OUT 
THERE OR SOMETHING.
PEOPLE MIGHT CATCH ON THIS IS A 
FAKE WINDOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ANYWAY, PEOPLE COME FROM ALL 
OVER THE WORLD TO BE IN THIS 
CITY, AND WHILE THEY'RE HERE, 
MANY TOURISTS TRY TO CATCH A BIG
BROADWAY SHOW.
YEAH.
UNFORTUNATELY, HERE'S THE SAD 
PART, A LOT OF THE HIT SHOWS 
WERE SOLD-OUT MONTHS AGO.
THEY'RE THAT POPULAR.
PEOPLE CAN'T GET IN.
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF GREAT 
OFF-BROADWAY PRODUCTIONS THAT 
ARE JUST AS GOOD.
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
THEM.
THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH 
PUBLICITY, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
COME TO THE CITY, AND THEY DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THESE COOL SHOWS.
SO FOLKS, WE HERE AT "LATE 
NIGHT," WE WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME
OF THESE OFF BROADWAY CHOICES IN
A PIECE WE'RE GONNA CALL --
THE BIG TREND ON BROADWAY THESE
DAYS IS THE SO-CALLED JUKEBOX 
MUSICAL.
THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE THE HIT 
SONGS OF A FAMOUS ARTIST AND YOU
BUILD A WHOLE SHOW AROUND THOSE 
SONGS.
FOR EXAMPLE, "MOVING OUT" IS 
BASED ON THE SONGS OF 
BILLY JOEL.
"MAMA MIA" IS BASED ON THE SONGS
OF ABBA.
BUT IF YOU CAN'T GET IN TO 
EITHER ONE OF THOSE HITS, YOU 
MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT THIS 
OFF-BROADWAY SHOW CALLED, "THE 
SONG OF THONG."
IT'S A THREE-HOUR MUSICAL BASED 
ON SINGER SISQO'S ONE HIT FROM 
1999.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET ME SEE THAT THONG
BABY, THAT THONG
THONG THONG THONG THONG
I LIKE IT WHEN THE BEAT GOES 
>> Conan: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S CALLED, "THE SONG OF 
THONG."
[ THONG SONG PLAYING AGAIN ]
STOP IT!
STOP IT!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TRUST ME, INTO THE THIRD HOUR IT
GETS OLD.
OKAY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WANT THAT MANNEQUIN.
"THE COLOR PURPLE" JUST OPENED 
ON BROADWAY AND, OF COURSE, "THE
COLOR PURPLE" IS BEING PRODUCED 
BY OPRAH WINFREY, AND THAT'S 
GONNA BE A GIANT SMASH.
WELL, ON OFF-BROADWAY THERE'S 
ANOTHER OPRAH WINFREY PROJECT.
IT'S CALLED "OPRAH THE MUSICAL."
SO TOM
TELL ME ABOUT KATIE 
OH I'M IN LOVE
SHE'S AMAZING 
I THINK SHE'S GREAT
I LOVE HER
I DO
I DO 
HEY WHAT'S YOUR NAME? 
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: THAT'S GONNA BE A 
SMASH.
TOM SEEMED DISTRACTED THERE AT 
THE END.
YOU KNOW, BROADWAY PRODUCERS 
OFTEN REINVIGORATE TIRED SHOWS 
BY PLUGGING TV AND MOVIE STARS 
INTO THEM.
THIS IS A TRIED AND TRUE 
FORMULA.
FOR EXAMPLE, ROSIE O'DONNELL WAS
BROUGHT IN TO GIVE "FIDDLER ON 
THE ROOF" STAR POWER, AND THAT 
GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE EXCITED.
WELL, NOW THEY'RE DOING THE SAME
THING TO THE LONG-RUNNING SHOW 
"STOMP."
"STOMP" IS WHERE THE PERFORMERS 
MAKE MUSIC OUT OF EVERYDAY 
OBJECTS.
THAT SHOW HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 
YEARS.
IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL.
AND I GUESS "STOMP" NEEDED A 
CELEBRITY JOLT.
SO THE STAR THEY PLUGGED INTO 
"STOMP" IS JUST PERFECT.
IT'S TV'S ABE VIGODA.
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: WOW.
TRUST ME, THAT DOES NOT GET OLD 
INTO THE THIRD HOUR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ABE GOES INTO SOME KIND OF 
TRANCE WHEN HE'S DOING THAT.
PROBABLY STILL DOING IT.
NOW, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT 
TECHNICALLY BROADWAY, NEW YORK'S
SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK PROGRAM 
IS AS POPULAR AS ANY SHOW IN 
TOWN.
SO POPULAR, IN FACT, THAT THIS 
YEAR CENTRAL PARK HAS AGREED TO 
HOST A PRODUCTION OF "HAMLET" 
RIGHT THROUGH THE WINTER.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A GOOD 
IDEA.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> A DOUBLE BLESSING IS A DOUBLE
GRACE.
OCCASION SMILES UPON A SECOND 
LEAVE.
>> YET HERE, LAERTES?
ABOARD, ABOARD, FOR SHAME!
THE WIND FITS IN THE SHOULDER OF
YOUR SAIL, AND YOU ARE STAY'D 
FOR.
THERE -- MY BLESSING WITH THEE.
AND THESE FEW PRECEPTS IN THY 
MEMORY LOOK THOU CHARACTER.
GIVE THY THOUGHTS NO TONGUE.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: OH, THAT POOR DOGGY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THAT WAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M AS CONFUSED AS YOU BY MY 
ACTIONS.
YOU KNOW, SOME OFF-BROADWAY 
SHOWS TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE 
POPULARITY OF MOVIES OR 
TELEVISION SHOWS, AND FRANKLY, I
THINK THAT'S PRETTY LAZY.
ALL RIGHT?
ESPECIALLY -- THIS IS THE WORST.
THIS NEW HOUR-LONG MUSICAL IS 
SIMPLY CALLED "THIS WEEK'S 
EPISODE OF 'LOST.'"
CHECK IT OUT.
THERE'S ONE THING I MUST
DO FOR YOU
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST 
AND THAT IS TURN ON
THIS WEEK'S SUPER EPISODE
OF "LOST" 
WE'RE WATCHING "LOST"
WE'RE WATCHING "LOST"
WE'RE WATCHING "LOST" 
WE'RE WATCHING "LOST"
WE'RE WATCHING "LOST" 
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: THAT'S ALL IT IS, THE 
WHOLE SHOW.
[ APPLAUSE ]
AND FINALLY, NOSTALGIA HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN POPULAR ON BROADWAY.
"GREASE" WAS A TRIBUTE TO 
THE '50s.
"HAIR" WAS A TRIBUTE TO 
THE '60s.
WELL, THIS NEXT SHOW CAPTURES 
THE NOSTALGIA WE ALL FEEL FOR 
ONE OF THE GREATEST CULTURAL 
PHENOMENONS OF THE 1980s.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
SHE'S GONNA FALL
I'M GONNA FALL
SHE'S GONNA FALL 
I'M GONNA FALL 
AND SHE WON'T
BE ABLE TO GET UP
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET UP
SHE'S FALLING NOW 
I'M FALLING NOW 
SHE'S FALLING NOW
AND HERE COMES ANOTHER LINE
THE WONDERFUL LINE 
IT'S THE MOST SENSATIONAL
LINE IN THE HISTORY
OF SENSATIONAL LINES 
I'VE FALLEN
AND I CAN'T GET UP 
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: KILLER SHOW.
HOW ABOUT A HAND FOR OUR 
PERFORMERS RIGHT HERE.
AREN'T THEY AMAZING?
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE --
THOSE ARE SOME BAD SHOWS.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK.
WHEN WE COME BACK, TINA FEY IS 
HERE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS IT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THERE'S A NEW PULSE

PAIN RELIEF OF TYLENOL,
AND A SLEEP AID THAT'S SAFE

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: OH, YEAH.
[ HOWLING ]
WE GOT THE --
WE GOT SUCH A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
MY FIRST GUEST IS A CAST MEMBER 
ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" AND 
CO-ANCHOR OF "WEEKEND UPDATE."
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HER IN 
ACTION.
>> A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT 66% OF 
AMERICANS THINK PRESIDENT BUSH 
IS DOING A POOR JOB OF HANDLING 
THE WAR IN IRAQ.
AND THE REMAINING 34% THINK ADAM
AND EVE RODE DINOSAURS TO 
CHURCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: FOLKS, PLEASE WELCOME 
TINA FEY.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: WOW.
LITTLE CRAZY IN HERE.
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[ CHEERS ]
>> Conan: YOU KNOW, I HAVE --
PLEASE, FELLAS, I'M HERE ALL 
NIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WORKS EVERY TIME.
YOU -- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE 
YOU GAVE BIRTH.
SO, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BABY
GIRL.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: THAT'S EXCITING.
>> IT'S VERY EXCITING.
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ON YOUR 
BABY.
>> Conan: BABY BOY, YEAH, YEAH.
>> WELL DONE.
>> Conan: BUT, GIRL, THAT'S 
BETTER.
BUT, THIS IS EXCITING.
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T REALLY 
KNOW THE STORY.
WERE YOU -- YOU KNOW, ON TV 
SHOWS, IT'S ALWAYS, LIKE, THIS 
EXCITING MOMENT.
THE WOMAN GOES INTO LABOR AND 
THEY'RE, LIKE, ON AN AIRPLANE OR
SOMETHING.
>> YEAH -- WATER BREAKS.
>> Conan: ANYTHING EXCITING WITH
YOU?
>> I WAS SITTING AT HOME ON A 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND I WAS WATCHING 
A MARATHON OF "KATHY GRIFFIN: MY
LIFE ON THE D-LIST."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I STARTED TO REALLY NOT FEEL
GOOD.
IN MY CORE.
IT TURNED OUT I WAS GOING INTO 
LABOR.
>> Conan: OH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, YOU THOUGHT IT WAS 
THE SHOW AND THEN --
SO, YOU START TO GO INTO 
LABOR --
WHAT DID YOU DO?
>> WELL, YOU TRY TO LABOR AT 
HOME AS LONG AS YOU CAN, JUST 
KIND OF WORK IT OUT.
AND THEN -- IT TURNED OUT MY 
HUSBAND, JEFF, HIS BIGGEST FEAR 
WAS THAT WE'D HAVE TO GET A CAB 
TO THE HOSPITAL IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT.
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
AND BY THE TIME WE GOT IN THE 
CAB, I WAS IN A STATE WHERE I 
WAS ONLY COMFORTABLE ON ALL 
FOURS.
SO, I WAS IN THE BACK OF THE CAB
ON ALL FOURS JUST GOING LIKE, 
"AHH!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WISH I COULD SAY THAT WAS THE 
ONLY TIME I'VE EVER BEEN IN THE 
BACK OF A CAB LIKE THAT, BUT --
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: THAT'S TWO OF US, 
YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ AUDIENCE OHS ]
THE '80s WAS A WEIRD TIME FOR 
ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
I TRIED THINGS I'LL NEVER TRY 
AGAIN.
OR WILL I?
NOW, THIS IS VERY EXCITING.
THE NAME OF YOUR --
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO 
NAME THE BABY, LIKE, "PUMPKIN 
INSPECTOR BRAVERY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: THAT'S THE FUN OF 
BEING A CELEBRITY.
>> YEAH, BUT I'M NOT FAMOUS 
ENOUGH, SO HER NAME IS ALICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, HER NAME IS ALICE ZENOBIA,
WHICH SHE'S NAMED AFTER HER TWO 
GRANDMOTHERS, SO HER MIDDLE NAME
IS ZENOBIA.
>> Conan: OH, THAT'S COOL.
>> YEAH, SO SHE HAS A NICE, 
FUNKY MIDDLE NAME, BUT --
>> Conan: SOME PEOPLE KEEP A 
BABY JOURNAL.
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: WE HAVE TWO KIDS.
MY WIFE DID THAT THE FIRST TIME,
THE SECOND TIME WAS JUST "NAH, 
SCREW THAT."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WE KEEP A JOURNAL OF, LIKE, 
EVERYTHING SHE EATS AND EVERY 
TIME SHE POOPS.
AND EVERY TIME SHE GOES TO 
SLEEP.
AND I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT JUST 
KEEP DOING IT FOREVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN WHEN SHE GETS MARRIED, 
I'LL JUST GIVE IT TO THE GROOM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
"SHE USUALLY POOPS AROUND 3:00."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: CREEPY.
"YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HER 
POOPING."
THAT IS SO WEIRD.
ARE YOU FINDING YOURSELF, LIKE, 
ARE YOU JUST STARING AT HER ALL 
THE TIME AND WRITING DOWN ALL 
THESE WEIRD FACTS AND IDEAS AND 
IT'S JUST --
>> YEAH, EVERYTHING.
>> Conan: YEAH, PEOPLE GET VERY 
OBSESSIVE.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE
NOTICED, WHEN YOU HAVE A LITTLE 
BABY, EVERYBODY WHEREVER YOU GO 
WANTS TO LOOK AT THE BABY.
AND THEY'RE KIND OF INSISTENT 
ABOUT IT.
>> YES, THEY WANNA HOLD THE 
BABY.
AND IN NEW YORK, YOU WALK IN THE
PARK AND, NEW YORK PEOPLE WILL 
JUST COME UP AND BE LIKE, "BOY 
OR GIRL?"
"HMM -- VERY LITTLE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND, LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW IF 
IT'S AN OLD LADY BEING NICE OR A
PERSON THAT WANTS TO EAT THE 
BABY AND WEAR ITS SKIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU HAVE TO BE READY.
I HAD A GUY COME OUT, I WAS 
PUSHING THE STROLLER THE OTHER 
DAY, 'CAUSE I PUSHED IT AROUND 
TO LOOK FOR PAPARAZZI.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: I DID THAT FOR YEARS 
WITH, LIKE, A PLASTIC BABY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO ONE CARED.
>> I WAS PUSHING THE STROLLER 
AND THIS GUY WAS LIKE -- FROM 
FAR AWAY THIS GUY WAS LIKE, 
"TINA, CONGRATULATIONS!"
I WAS LIKE, "OH, THANK YOU."
AND THEN HE'S LIKE, "WHEN'S 
HOWARD GONNA BE ON 'SATURDAY 
NIGHT LIVE'?"
>> Conan: BABA BOOEY.
>> HE JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHEN 
STERN WAS COMING ON.
>> Conan: NOW, WHAT ABOUT A 
PICTURE?
YOU KNOW, SOME CELEBRITIES 
AREN'T AFRAID TO, LIKE, SHOW A 
PICTURE OF THEIR BABY.
>> NO, I'M PROUD OF HER.
I BROUGHT A PICTURE.
>> Conan: YOU BROUGHT A PICTURE?
OH, COOL.
LET'S SEE THIS, THIS IS GREAT.
OH, THERE YOU GO.
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S NICE.
>> I'M NOT SO GOOD AT DRAWING, 
BUT THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.
>> Conan: THAT CAPTURES HER 
MOOD.
SHE SEEMS UNHAPPY.
>> MISERABLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: JUST, YOU KNOW, 
DEPRESSED ABOUT --
NOW, HAS MOTHERHOOD -- SOMETIMES
MOTHERHOOD CAN CHANGE A WOMAN.
HAS IT SOFTENED YOU AT ALL?
HAS IT CHANGED YOUR PERSPECTIVE?
>> YEAH.
NOW, IT'S DIFFERENT.
LIKE, I CAN ONLY WATCH PORN 
WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE NICE TO 
EACH OTHER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CAN'T WATCH ALL THE VIOLENT PORN
THAT I USED TO WATCH.
>> Conan: YEAH.
YOU WANT PORN WITH A HAPPY 
ENDING.
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: PORN WITH GOOD VALUES.
[ CHEERS ]
NOT THAT!
OH, MAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YOU JUST STEPPED RIGHT INTO 
THAT.
>> Conan: I DID.
HA, HA.
YES I DID.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I'M TRYING TO STOP CURSING SO
MUCH.
'CAUSE I DO HAVE A REALLY BAD 
MOUTH.
LIKE, YOU KNOW, I GOTTA STOP 
CURSING NOW.
>> Conan: STOP SWEARING, YEAH, 
EXACTLY.
>> YEAH.
SO, I'M TRYING TO DO THIS ONE I 
GOT FROM AMY POEHLER.
WHEN I'M MAD, I SAY, "AW, 
NERDS!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
"NERDS -- AND BALONEY!"
I GO, "THIS IS BALONEY!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: THEY'RE NOT GONNA 
WORK.
THAT'S THE THING.
WHEN YOU HIT YOUR THUMB WITH A 
HAMMER, YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY 
"BALONEY."
>> "OH, BALONEY!"
>> Conan: YEAH, IT'S NOT GONNA 
HAPPEN.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
AMY CURSES TOO.
>> AMY WILL DROP SOME, YEAH.
>> Conan: AMY POEHLER LIKES TO 
CURSE IT UP EVERY NOW AND THEN, 
I'VE HEARD.
>> ME AND HER BOTH.
>> Conan: WE ALL WORK IN THE 
SAME BUILDING AND EVERY NOW AND 
THEN, I HEAR HER CURSING FROM 
TWO FLOORS AWAY.
>> OH MAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE WENT TO TORONTO ONE TIME ON 
THIS FLIGHT, MAKING 
"MEAN GIRLS."
AND ME AND ANA GASTEYER AND 
AMY POEHLER WERE ALL ON THIS 
FLIGHT AND WE GOT OFF THE FLIGHT
AND THIS BUSINESS MAN, LIKE, 
PUSHED PAST AMY.
AMY WAS LIKE, "HEY, WHAT'S UP, 
YOU SHOULD SAY YOU'RE SORRY."
AND HE WAS LIKE, "YOU SHOULD SAY
YOU'RE SORRY FOR BEING IN MY 
WAY."
LIKE, HE WAS REALLY RUDE TO HER.
AND I SAW HER LITTLE IRISH BRAIN
SNAP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHE JUST LOOKED UP AND SHE JUST 
TOOK THIS BREATH AND SHE WAS 
LIKE --
"WELL --
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: YEAH.
[ MAKES CRAZY SOUNDS ]
>> AND THE DUDE LITERALLY RAN 
AWAY.
>> Conan: HE RAN AWAY?
>> HE WAS LIKE A 50-YEAR-OLD 
BUSINESS MAN AND HE RAN AWAY.
>> Conan: I LOVE THAT, I MEAN, I
LOVE AMY, BUT I LOVE THE IDEA 
THAT'S SHE'S NOT THAT BIG.
AND I LOVE THAT A GUY WOULD JUST
RUN AWAY FROM HER.
SHE'D GET SO MAD.
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: NOW, YOU'RE FINALLY 
BACK ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
HAS IT BEEN AN ADJUSTMENT FOR 
YOU TO GET BACK AND, SAY, DO 
"UPDATE."
>> IT IS.
YOU CAN SEE IN THAT CLIP, THEY 
HAD TO GIVE ME A WHOLE, A NEW 
"UPDATE" JACKET.
'CAUSE, I JUST HAVE THE OLD 
SWEATER --
BUT, I'M BACK IN MY OLD JACKET.
IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER.
BUT, YEAH, IT WAS WEIRD TO GO 
BACK TO WORK.
AND EVEN JUST COMING INTO 
MIDTOWN, I HADN'T COME DOWN HERE
IN SO LONG AND I HADN'T RIDDEN 
THE SUBWAY IN A LONG TIME.
>> Conan: OH, HERE'S THE OTHER 
THING I WANNA -- YEAH, 'CAUSE 
THIS BRINGS UP SOMETHING.
IT IS SO INCREDIBLY CROWDED NOW 
HERE IN MANHATTAN.
AND WITH THE TREE, IT'S INSANITY
OUTSIDE.
DO YOU ACTUALLY -- DO YOU TAKE 
THE SUBWAY TO WORK?
>> I DO NOW, 'CAUSE, YOU 
CAN'T -- THE CAB IS TOO SLOW AND
I TOOK THE SUBWAY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS 
RIGHT WHEN THEY HAD THE CRAZY 
ALERTS ON THE SUBWAY.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D TAKEN 
THE SUBWAY IN MONTHS AND I CAME 
DOWN AND THE TRAIN PULLED UP 
RIGHT AS I GOT THERE.
AND THE DOORS OPENED.
AND GOD BLESS HIM, THERE WAS A 
DUDE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF 
ME AND THE SIDEWAYS SEAT WAS A 
MIDDLE-AGED PAKISTANI GUY WITH 
AN ENORMOUS BRAND NEW FULLY 
PACKED BACK-PACK ON HIS LAP.
AND LIKE A BASEBALL HAT THAT WAS
A LITTLE TOO NEW WITH THE 
AMERICAN RED CROSS.
AND HE'S JUST, LIKE, SITTING 
THERE.
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THIS 
OUT LOUD, BUT THE TRAIN CAME AND
THE DOORS WERE JUST CLOSING AND 
I JUST WENT, "OH, HELL NO."
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
THEN HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE, 
"LADY" --
>> Conan: YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN 
HIS WHOLE RIDE THROUGH 
MANHATTAN, NO ONE GETTING ON.
EVERYONE'S LIKE, "HELL NO!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> HE PROBABLY WORKS FOR THE 
RED CROSS.
>> Conan: HE PROBABLY DOES.
>> PROBABLY A LOVELY MAN.
>> Conan: WELL, "SATURDAY NIGHT 
LIVE" AIRS TOMORROW NIGHT WITH 
HOST ALEC BALDWIN.
THIS IS -- HOW MANY -- HE'S 
HOSTED, LIKE, A RECORD NUMBER OF
TIMES.
>> HE'S ONE BEHIND STEVE MARTIN.

JACK BLACK COMING ON THE SHOW 
AND MUCH, MUCH MORE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
ALL RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
A WHILE AGO, THIS WAS QUITE A 
WHILE AGO, I MADE A JOKE.
THIS IS A TRUE STORY, BY THE 
WAY, I NEVER LIE.
I MADE A JOKE ABOUT THE UKRAINE.
AND AFTER I MADE THE JOKE, 
"LATE NIGHT" GOT A TON OF ANGRY 
LETTERS.
ALL RIGHT?
HERE'S THE WEIRD THING.
THE LETTERS WERE FROM THE 
UKRAINE.
I HONESTLY HAD NO IDEA WE WERE 
EVEN ON IN THE UKRAINE.
I HAD NO CLUE THAT THEY COULD 
EVEN GET OUR SHOW, BUT 
APPARENTLY IT'S SEEN THERE ON 
SATELLITE.
AND THAT GOT ME THINKING --
WHERE ELSE ARE WE ON?
WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN YOU 
SEE "LATE NIGHT WITH 
CONAN O'BRIEN"?
WELL, I COULD ASK THE NETWORK, 
BUT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T TELL 
ME, 'CAUSE THEN THEY'D HAVE TO 
PAY ME.
SO, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND
OUT.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND 
OUT.
AND THAT IS TO VICIOUSLY INSULT 
EVERY NATION IN THE WORLD --
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND SEE WHICH ONES I GET LETTERS
FROM, RIGHT?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SO, WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT.
I MEAN, FOR EASILY, I THINK FOR 
THE LAST, WHAT HAS IT BEEN?
LIKE, A YEAR, NOW, RIGHT GUYS?
FOR A YEAR, WE'VE BEEN DOING 
JUST THAT.
IT IS WORKING LIKE A CHARM, 
OKAY?
PEOPLE IN COUNTRIES WE DIDN'T 
EVEN KNOW GOT "LATE NIGHT," NOW 
HATE US ENOUGH TO SEND ANGRY 
LETTERS.
THIS IS JUST LIKE TODAY'S PILE.
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE 
ARE WRITING US ANGRY MAIL.
SO, FOLKS, TONIGHT WE HAVE A LOT
MORE COUNTRIES TO BRING DOWN A 
NOTCH.
LET'S GET TO IT, IT WON'T TAKE 
LONG, BUT LET'S GO.
FIRST UP, MALAYSIA, LET'S DO IT.
MALAYSIA, WHERE THE POLICE CAN 
YOU FIRST, THEN ASK FOR A BRIBE.
[ APPLAUSE ]
MALDIVES, YOU'LL COME FOR THE 
TROPICAL CLIMATE, YOU'LL STAY 
'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN EATEN BY 
TIGER SHARKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MALI, WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
PEOPLE ARGUING IN TRIBAL 
LANGUAGES OVER THE LAST PILE OF 
GROUND NUTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MALTA --
YOU HAVE TO BE HARSH TO GET 
MAIL, FOLKS.
MALTA, BRIMMING WITH CULTURE, 
HISTORY AND SICILIAN HOOKERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FINALLY, THE MARSHALL 
ISLANDS.
WE TRIED TO WRITE A JOKE ABOUT 
YOUR COUNTRY, WE GOOGLED IT.
NO RESULTS WERE FOUND.
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Announcer: SEND YOUR ANGRY

>> Conan: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
WE ARE BACK.
AT ONLY 18 YEARS OLD, MY NEXT 
GUEST MAKES HIS MOVIE DEBUT 
STARRING IN "THE CHRONICLES OF 
NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND 
THE WARDROBE."
OPENED IN THEATERS TODAY.
PLEASE WELCOME WILLIAM MOSELEY.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> I'M VERY, VERY WELL, THANK 
YOU.
>> Conan: ALL RIGHT, NOW, 
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE FAR FROM HOME.
YOU'RE FROM GREAT BRITIAN.
>> INDEED.
>> Conan: INDEED.
ARE YOU ENJOYING NEW YORK CITY?
DO YOU LIKE IT HERE?
>> I LOVE IT HERE.
I'M JUST SURPRISED AT THE 
CHRISTMAS TREES.
>> Conan: YOU MEAN HOW MANY 
THERE ARE?
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THEY'RE HUGE.
I MEAN, IN LONDON WE DON'T HAVE 
HALF AS MANY AS THEY DO OUT 
HERE.
IT'S AMAZING.
>> Conan: ISN'T IT?
IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME THING.
THEY DON'T MAKE AS BIG A DEAL OF
IT OVER THERE.
DO THEY?
THEY HAVE, LIKE, CHRISTMAS, BUT 
HERE WE GO FOR GIANT TREES ALL 
OVER THE PLACE.
PLASTIC, MARCHING SNOWMEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SANTAS SHOOTING LASERS.
YOU KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING ALONG 
THOSE LINES.
I WAS QUITE SURPRISED.
YEAH, I MEAN, IT SEEMS TO BE 
EACH HOTEL OR EACH, YOU KNOW, 
STORE SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO OUT 
DO EACH OTHER.
EACH MAN IS TRYING TO BIGGER 
HIMSELF.
I MEAN, IT DOES SURPRISE ME, I 
HAVE TO SAY.
>> Conan: THAT'S JUST OUR WHOLE 
CULTURE, IS "WHO CAN PUSH IT 
FURTHER" AND EACH CHRISTMAS IT 
GETS CRAZIER AND CRAZIER AND 
THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT 
THIS COUNTRY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: WE'VE EVEN FORGOTTEN 
WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT IN THE 
FIRST PLACE.
"THAT'S THE DAY SANTA WAS BORN."
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT.
NOW, YOU'RE -- YOU'RE -- 
WHEREABOUTS ARE YOU FROM IN 
ENGLAND?
>> I'M ACTUALLY FROM THE --
WHICH IS VERY RURAL.
IT'S NOT LONDON.
IT'S ROLLING HILLS.
VERY BEAUTIFUL.
>> Conan: IT'S NICE THERE, I 
BET.
>> YEAH, IT IS NICE.
>> Conan: DID YOU -- NOW, YOU 
SHOT THIS MOVIE IN NEW ZEALAND.
>> RIGHT.
>> Conan: IS THAT CORRECT?
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Conan: WAS IT TOUGH?
I MEAN, YOU HAD TO LEAVE YOUR --
YOU'RE A VERY YOUNG PERSON.
WHEN YOU STARTED DOING THIS 
MOVIE, HOW OLD WERE YOU?
WERE YOU, LIKE, 17, 16?
>> WELL, THEY STARTED 
AUDITIONING ME AT 15 YEARS OLD 
AND THAT WAS 18 MONTH PROCESS.
AND THEN I HAD -- I HAD SEVEN 
MONTHS IN NEW ZEALAND AT 
17 YEARS OLD.
>> Conan: THAT WOULD BE -- I -- 
I, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T LEAVE HOME 
FOR QUITE A WHILE.
I THINK I WAS IN MY LATE 30s.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SIX WEEKS AGO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I'M STILL ADJUSTING TO THIS 
WORLD.
BUT WAS IT TOUGH FOR YOU TO 
LEAVE, YOU KNOW, YOUR FAMILY, 
YOUR FRIENDS AND GO TO 
NEW ZEALAND?
WAS THAT HARD?
>> UM, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE THING
IS, I SORT OF RELISHED THIS 
CHALLENGE.
I WAS THINKING -- YOU KNOW, 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
ENGLAND TAKE A GAP, WHICH IS A 
YEAR OUT BEFORE UNIVERSITY OR 
COLLEGE.
>> Conan: RIGHT.
>> AND, YOU KNOW, I --
I WAS LIKE, "WELL, I'LL TAKE 
THIS YEAR OUT.
YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE COOL, I'LL 
BE, YOU KNOW --
I'LL SPEND SOME TIME BY MYSELF."
I SPENT AROUND THREE MONTHS BY 
MYSELF.
AND I REMEMBER WHEN MY DAD LEFT 
AND HE, YOU KNOW --
AND I WAS THINKING, "YEAH, I'LL 
BE COOL.
I'LL BE BY MYSELF, HAVE MY OWN 
HOUSE."
AND HE LEFT AND HE SAID, 
"GOOD-BYE."
I WAS LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE.
HE'S ACTUALLY LEAVING."
>> Conan: RIGHT.
>> "HE'S ACTUALLY --"
SO, I GOT BACK TO THE HOUSE.
I WAS DOING ABSOLUTE LONESOME.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, SO I STARTED 
TURNING EVERYTHING ON.
I MEAN, I WAS OBSESSIVELY 
COMPULSIVE TURNING THE LIGHT 
SWITCH ON, THE MICROWAVE ON, THE
RADIO, THE TV.
I MEAN, IT WAS CRAZY.
>> Conan: JUST 'CAUSE YOU WERE 
AFRAID.
I THINK TURNING THE MICROWAVE ON
WAS PROBABLY A BAD IDEA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, MY HAND IS STILL GLOWING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YEAH, YEAH.
IT WAS KIND OF A LITTLE WEIRD.
>> Conan: NOW, SO -- SO, WHAT 
WOULD YOU DO IF YOU GOT REALLY 
BORED?
WAS THERE ANYPLACE YOU COULD GO?
WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU COULD DO?
WAS THERE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE 
GATHERED?
I MEAN --
>> UM -- YEAH, I MEAN, YEAH, 
IT'S MUCH LIKE THE REST OF THE 
WORLD, NEW ZEALAND, ACTUALLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN, YOU CAN GO OUT.
YOU CAN GO TO THE CINEMA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: WOW, OKAY.
>> COOL, YEAH.
WE DID DO ALL THOSE KIND OF 
THINGS AND IT WAS FABULOUS.
LIKE, IT WAS AMAZING THAT THE 
NEW ZEALANDERS ARE SO WELCOMING.
>> Conan: RIGHT.
>> THEY'RE CREW THAT, LIKE, 
BRINGS EVERYONE ON BOARD.
AND WE WENT OUT TO THE CINEMA.
YOU KNOW, WE DID ALL THESE GREAT
THINGS.
AND I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SAY, BUT 
WE DID GO TO THE PUB EVERY 
NIGHT.
>> Conan: WENT TO THE PUB?
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: BUT YOU SAID YOU 
STARTED DOING THIS MOVIE WHEN 
YOU WERE 15, 16 YEARS OLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> 17,17.
>> Conan: IS IT LEGAL TO GO TO A
PUB WHEN YOU'RE THAT AGE IN 
NEW ZEALAND?
>> WELL, I'M TOLD -- I THINK, 
YEAH.
I MEAN, I THINK IF YOU'RE WITH 
AN ADULT AND YOU'RE IN AN ADULT 
ENVIRONMENT, I THINK IT'S FINE.
I MEAN, I USED TO HAVE A PUB AT 
MY SCHOOL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: YOU THINK? 
YOU CLEARLY HAVEN'T -- YOU 
CLEARLY HAVEN'T RESEARCHED THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
"I THINK IT'S OKAY.
I GLUED A MUSTACHE TO MY FACE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> AND GOT THEM EYES.
>> Conan: YEAH, SURE.
>> I MEAN, PRETTY MUCH.
>> Conan: YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT IS DIFFERENT IN EUROPE, 
THOUGH.
WHEN I WAS IN IRELAND, I MEAN, 
PEOPLE -- IT'S MORE OF A --
IT'S NOT LIKE IT IS HERE.
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN THE 
PUBS.
THERE WERE, LIKE, KIDS RUNNING 
AROUND IN THE PUBS.
>> I KNOW.
>> Conan: YEAH.
>> WELL, I MEAN, I USED TO HAVE 
A PUB AT MY SCHOOL, FUNNY 
ENOUGH.
>> Conan: WAIT, WAIT, BACK IT 
UP.
YOU HAD A PUB AT YOUR SCHOOL?
>> I USED TO HAVE A PUB AT MY 
SCHOOL.
>> Conan: CAN WE ALL JOIN?
AND HOW CAN WE ALL JOIN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY IS A PUB?
>> YEAH, REALLY, REALLY, 
HONESTLY.
I MEAN, BECAUSE THEY -- IT WAS A
BOARDING SCHOOL SO, THEY KINDA 
KNEW, YOU KNOW, "WHAT ARE KIDS 
GONNA DO AT NIGHT OR THE 
WEEKENDS."
THEY'RE GOING TO GO THE PUB 
ANYWAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, THEY THOUGHT, "WHY NOT HAVE 
IT IN THE SCHOOL."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: WHAT KIND OF LOGIC IS 
THAT?
"AND THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO 
GO LOOKING FOR HOOKERS AT SOME 
POINT, SO, LET'S - -"
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
I MEAN THAT WAS THEIR LOGIC.
RIGHT, RIGHT, OKAY.
SO, LITERALLY, YOU'D BE, LIKE, 
FINISHING YOUR -- YOU'D FINISH 
YOU EXAMS IN, LIKE, FIFTH GRADE 
AND BE LIKE, "LET'S KNOCK BACK A
GUINNESS, EVERYBODY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO BE 16.
YOU HAVE TO BE 16.
>> Conan: RULES ARE RULES.
>> I MEAN, RULES ARE RULES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU HAVE TO BE 16.
IT'S NOT LIKE OUT HERE WHERE 
IT'S 21.
BUT, I MEAN, I THINK IT WAS KIND
OF GOOD JUST BECAUSE THE 
TEACHERS DID HAVE SOME CONTROL 
OVER THE KIDS.
>> Conan: SURE.
>> AND THEY WERE LIKE, "THIS IS 
DRINKING TIME."
>> Conan: KIDS ARE SMASHED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WELL, THEY CAN'T CONTROL THEM
THEN.
>> Conan: NOW, OKAY, LET'S TALK 
ABOUT THIS MOVIE "NARNIA" WHICH 
IS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED.
BASED ON THE C.S. LEWIS SERIES.
>> RIGHT.
>> Conan: THERE'S A VIDEO GAME, 
OF COURSE, AS THERE IS WITH MOST
BIG MOVIES LIKE THIS, MOST 
BIG-BUDGET MOVIES.
AND YOU'RE IN -- YOUR 
CHARACTER'S IN THE VIDEO GAME 
NOW.
>> HE IS.
>> Conan: IS -- IS IT FUN?
HAVE YOU PLAYED IT?
>> WELL, MY BROTHERS PLAYED IT.
AND THIS IS ANOTHER GRAND THING 
ABOUT HAVING FAMILY.
HE'S YOUNGER THAN ME.
AND HE'S KILLED ME SEVERAL 
HUNDRED TIMES, ACTUALLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I THINK THAT WAS IN THE 
FIRST TEN MINUTES OF GETTING THE
VIDEO.
AND THEN HIS SECOND COMPLAINT 
ABOUT THE VIDEO GAME WAS THERE 
ISN'T ENOUGH BLOOD.
I DON'T DIE WELL ENOUGH.
SO, WHETHER WE HAVE TO READJUST,
YOU KNOW --
>> Conan: THAT'S A REALLY 
INTERESTING WAY FOR A YOUNGER 
BROTHER TO GET OUT HIS HOSTILITY
FOR HIS OLDER BROTHER.
TO BE ABLE TO MURDER HIM IN A 
VIDEO GAME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I THINK IT'S BASICALLY AN 
ADVANCEMENT OF VOODOO.
I MEAN, I HAVE A FEELING 
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WASN'T SURE I 
WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE THE VIDEO 
GAME, BUT I SAT DOWN, I PLAYED 
AND I ENDED UP PLAYING FOR ABOUT
4 1/2 HOURS.
NONSTOP.
>> Conan: DID YOU FIND YOURSELF 
KILLING YOURSELF?
WAS THAT EVER HAPPENING?
>> WELL, IT DID HAPPEN EVERY NOW
AND AGAIN BECAUSE I WOULD ONLY 
USE MY CHARACTER BECAUSE I 
WANTED TO SEE HIM USE THE SWORD.
>> Conan: WELL, YOU KNOW IT'S A 
BIG SIGN OF SUCCESS IN THIS 
COUNTRY.
A HUGE SIGN OF SUCCESS IN THIS 
COUNTRY WHEN YOU BECOME A 
McDONALD'S MEAL TREAT.
AND YOU'VE ACHIEVED THAT.
YOU'RE CHARACTER'S A McDONALD'S 
HAPPY MEAL TREAT.
[ CHEERS ]
KIDS ALL OVER THE PLACE ARE 
GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH THIS 
CHARACTER WHEN THEY GET, LIKE, A
BIG MAC OR SOMETHING.
>> I KNOW.
>> Conan: THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> BUT MY ONLY THING ABOUT THIS 
IS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE GINGER 
HAIR.
I HAVE THIS ORANGE HAIR.
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH ORANGE 
HAIR?
ORANGE HAIR IS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I MEAN, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT,
BUT --
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I MEAN, I MEAN, IT'S PERFECT.
BUT MY --
>> Conan: THAT'S A SIGN OF 
VIRILITY IN THIS COUNTRY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WOMEN ARE LIKE, "GINGER HAIR!
LET'S GET IT ON!"
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> WELL, I MEAN, HE DOES HAVE 
SOME COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE.
>> Conan: THAT'S SOME GREAT 
SWORD MOVE HE'S GOT THERE.
>> THAT'S A GREAT SWORD MOVE.
>> Conan: YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.
"I'LL GET YOU, BY MOVING THIS 
SWORD THREE INCHES UP AND DOWN."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I'M BEING THREE INCHES HIGH 
SO, IT'S GREAT.
>> Conan: AND, OF COURSE, 
"NARNIA" IS BASED, AS I SAID, 
IT'S ON THE C.S. LEWIS CLASSIC.
WE HAVE A CLIP HERE.
>> WOW.
>> Conan: THIS IS QUITE AN 
ADVENTURE.
WHAT CAN WE SAY IN THIS CLIP?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
>> WELL, BASICALLY, WE'RE BEING 
CHASED BY THE WOLVES.
THIS IS ACTUALLY A SCENE THAT 
WAS ADDED.
IT'S NOT PART OF THE STORY.
IT WAS ADDED IN TO THE SCRIPT.
>> Conan: OKAY.
>> THE WOLVES CHASE US AND I, 
BASICALLY, I HAVE A CHOICE OF 
KILLING THE WOLVES OR GETTING MY
BROTHER BACK BY BARGAINING WITH 
THEM, BUT I STICK THE SWORD IN 
THE EYES AND THE SWORD WILL 
BREAK, ENGULFS US -- MYSELF AND 
MY TWO SISTERS --
>> Conan: YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED 
EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE CLIP 
AND THERE'S NO REASON TO SHOW 
IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'LL SEE IT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK RIGHT NOW FROM
THIS CLIP FROM "THE CHRONICLES 
OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH 
AND THE WARDROBE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S SEE.
[ WOLVES GROWLING ]
[ GIRL SCREAMS ]
>> PUT THAT DOWN, BOY.
SOMEONE COULD GET HURT.
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE, SON OF 
ADAM?
I WON'T WAIT FOREVER.
>> HOLD ON TO ME.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: THAT'S GOOD.
AND AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.
>> YEAH, AND AN ACCURATE 
DESCRIPTION.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: "THE CHRONICLES OF 
NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND 
THE WARDROBE" IS IN THEATERS

BUT DON'T WORRY, MY DOCTOR SAYS 
THERE'S ONLY A 30% CHANCE THAT'S
IT'S ASIAN BIRD FLU.
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
I LIKE THOSE ODDS.

[ CARSON WHISTLES ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Joe: OH, ME?

HOST THE SHOW.
>> Joe: I THINK I COULD 
HANDLE THAT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Carson: OKAY?
MAYBE.
I'M HERE TONIGHT, BUT IF WE 
SAID THAT --
ONE CONDITION, THOUGH, YOU HAVE 
TO HOST -- YOU CAN'T SIT IN MY 
SEAT, YOU HAVE TO HOST FROM

[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Joe: I WOULD ONLY HOST IT 
FROM RIGHT HERE.
>> Carson: YOU HAVE TO ASK ALL 
YOUR QUESTIONS FROM THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M FEELING WORSE BY THE SECOND,
THAT COULD BE THE JOKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS WAS INTERESTING -- A COUPLE
THINGS I WANTED TO POINT OUT.
PILOTS AT DELTA AIRLINES ARE 
PLANNING A PRACTICE STRIKE TO 
SHOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEIR 
DEMANDS ARE NOT MET.
THIS COULD CAUSE THOUSANDS OF 
DELTA FLIGHTS TO BE DELAYED OR 
EVEN CANCELLED.
IN OTHER WORDS, EVERYTHING WILL 
BE EXACTLY THE SAME.
WOW!
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
TAKE THAT, DELTA!
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT A BIG SHOT HERE, GOING 
AFTER DELTA.
NEXT WEEK -- CONTINENTAL.

JOE'S HOSTING.
THERE WAS -- THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY
CRAZY.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU -- THERE WAS
A RECENT POLL THAT SHOWS THAT 
TOM CRUISE IS NOW LESS POPULAR 
THAN SADDAM HUSSEIN.
DID YOU READ ABOUT THAT?
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
TOM CRUISE IS LESS POPULAR
THAN SADDAM.
QUICK TO RESPOND, PRESIDENT BUSH
HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S 
GOING TO BOMB "MISSION 
IMPOSSIBLE" LAND.
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
HE'S JUST GONNA BLOW IT UP.
I SAID I WAS SICK!
THAT'S JOE FIRSTMAN!
JOE --
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Carson: WHAT AM I DOING?
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL SHOW.
I'LL EXPLAIN WHO'S HERE.
A BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS, FROM THE 
NEW MOVIE "LUCKY NUMBER 
SLEVIN" -- LUCY LIU IS IN THE 
HOUSE TONIGHT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
ALSO, FOR MUSIC -- GREAT BAND, 
FROM SAN FRANCISCO -- I USED TO 
WORK UP THERE, LIVE ON A RADIO 
STATION, AND LOVED TO PLAY THIS 
BAND AND SEE THEM LIVE.
AND THIS IS THEIR SECOND TIME ON
THE "LATE NIGHT" SHOW, AND 
WE'RE THRILLED.
BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NICE.
LOTS TO GET TO TONIGHT.
HOW WE DOING ON TIME, AM I 
ALL RIGHT?
GOOD.
>> Joe: NICE.
>> Carson: WE OBVIOUSLY USED TO 
SHOOT THIS SHOW IN 
NEW YORK CITY.
WE WERE THERE FOR PROBABLY -- 
ABOUT FOUR, MAYBE FOUR YEARS 
SHOOTING THIS SHOW.
I'D BEEN THERE FOR TEN YEARS, 
PRIOR TO MOVING TO LOS ANGELES.
AND MY TIME IN NEW YORK, DEFINED
BY MY TIME SPENT, REALLY, IN 
THE SUBWAY.
I TOOK THE SUBWAY EVERYWHERE.
AND I THINK MOST NEW YORKERS USE
THE SUBWAY AS A FORM OF 
TRANSPORTATION.
I USED TO TAKE THE 1 OR THE 9.
IF I REALLY NEEDED TO GET THERE 
IN A JIFFY, I'D TAKE 
THE EXPRESS.
IT WAS THE NUMBER 3.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE IS -- THE STORY THAT WE 
WERE READING ABOUT, $160 MILLION
IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOR THE CITY OF
NEW YORK.
THEY'VE JUST ADDED AUTOMATED 
SIGNS DOWN IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM,
WHICH IS A GREAT IDEA.
HAVE YOU BEEN TO NEW YORK?
HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE SUBWAYS?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT'S VERY --
>> Joe: DIFFICULT.
>> Carson: IT'S DIFFICULT TO G
AROUND IT, JOE.
THAT'S THE WORD.
IF I HAD TO PICK A WORD, 
IT'S "DIFFICULT."
>> Joe: IT'S VERY DIFFICULT 
FOR ME.
>> Carson: THANK YOU FOR ADDING 
TO MY STORY.
THEY HAVE ADDED THE AUTOMATED 
SIGNS, AND THEY MAKE IT EASIER 
FOR COMMUTERS.
THEY LET 'EM KNOW WHEN THE NEXT 
TRAIN'S COMING.
YOU GO DOWN THERE, IT'S JUST 
ANOTHER WORLD DOWN THERE.
$160 MILLION.
THEY STARTED TO ROLL OUT SOME OF
THESE AUTOMATED SIGNS IN 
THE SUBWAY.
HAVE A FEW OF THEM.
THIS IS THE FIRST ONE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE IN 
COLUMBUS CIRCLE.
IT'S THERE NOW.
TAKE A LOOK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S ONE OF THEM.
KIND OF -- THAT'S NEW YORK.
THEY'VE GOT A BIT OF 
AN ATTITUDE.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
KIND OF A WEIRD THING TO SEE ON 
A SIGN.
>> Joe: IT'S VERY NEW YORK.
>> Carson: YOU KNOW?
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW -- A SIGN.
AND THEN, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
THIS ONE'S AT TIMES SQUARE, IN 
THE SUBWAY, THE AUTOMATED SIGN.
NEXT TRAIN -- FIVE MINUTES.
NEXT MURDER -- FOUR MINUTES.
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S HELPFUL, I THINK, 
FOR PEOPLE.
STICK AROUND, SEE THE MURDER IN 
FOUR MINUTES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE.
THIS IS GONNA BE UP AT 
125th STOP IN HARLEM, I BELIEVE.
THIS IS THE SIGN.
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Joe: WOW.
>> Carson: HOBO URINE.
THAT'S HELPFUL.
THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF URINE IN THE SUBWAYS OF 
NEW YORK.
THAT ONE LETS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU 
WALK AROUND, YOU'RE WALKING 
AROUND THE HOBO URINE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT PEOPLE URINE.
WAS THAT A NEW YORK SUBWAY?
NOT SO MUCH, WAS IT?
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE THIS LAST 
ONE, HERE.
THIS WILL BE AT EVERY SINGLE 
SUBWAY STATION IN NEW YORK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S THE RAT POPULATION.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S A LOT OF RATS.
HOW WE FEELING?
NOW, IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS SHOW 
BEFORE -- AND THANK YOU FOR 
WATCHING AGAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
JOE, LET ME EXPLAIN 
SOMETHING, HERE.
THERE'S ALWAYS POLLS.
THERE'S POLLS FOR EVERYTHING, 
THAT
PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING IS 
AT, LIKE, 38%.
YOU'LL READ CONSTANTLY THAT, YOU
KNOW, 65 PEOPLE OUT OF 
100 POLLED THINK THAT THE 
COUNTRY'S GOING THE RIGHT WAY, 
THE WRONG WAY, WHATEVER.
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T LIKE.
THE POLLS -- YOU NEVER HEAR FROM
THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE 
PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP THE BETTER 
PART OF THE UNITED STATES.
WE HAVE A GREAT DEVICE, THAT WE 
CAN ACTUALLY GO AND TALK TO 
PEOPLE, AND REALLY GET TO THE 
HEART OF WHAT EVERYBODY IS 
TALKING ABOUT IN THIS COUNTRY.
THERE IS ONE PLACE THAT DEFINES 
US AS A NATION, THAT WE ALL GO 
NO MATTER WHAT -- 
THAT'S THE MALL.
WE ALL GO TO THE MALL.
AND WITH THAT IN MIND, WE HAVE 
OUR LATEST EDITION OR 
AWARD-WINNING LOOK AT THE MOST 
IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THIS 
COUNTRY.
IT'S TIME NOW FOR 
"ESCALATOR INTERVIEWS."

"BLANK CHECK."
MA'AM, CAN YOU HELP ME?
I'M IN LOVE WITH A STRIPPER.
MA'AM.

[ LAUGHTER ]

HERE BEFORE.
>> Carson: I KNOW.
THERE'S A FIRST FOR EVERYTHING.

GOOD, GOOD.
SPEND IT WISELY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> KIDDING, KIDDING.
>> Carson: IT WAS FANTASTIC.
HOW IS YOUR DAY GOING SO FAR?
GOOD?
>> IT'S GOING GREAT, YEAH.
I JUST GOT BACK FROM NEW YORK, 
SO --
>> Carson: OH, YEAH?
HOW WAS NEW YORK THESE DAYS?
DID YOU SEE THE SUBWAYS?
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE YET?
>> THE WHAT?
>> Carson: THEY -- NEVER MIND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE SHOULD SEE WHAT THE RAT COUNT
IS UP TO.
PLEASE, IF YOU CAN, LET US KNOW.
IN THE SUBWAYS, NOW, IN 
NEW YORK, THEY'RE PUTTING 
AUTOMATED SIGNS TO HELP 
COMMUTERS OUT.
LIKE, THAT'S - SEE, LOOK 
AT THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE SUBWAY RAT POPULATION.
>> OH, FANTASTIC.
NICE!
>> Carson: YOU SEE, LUCY, THE 
JOKE THERE IS THAT --
>> I GET IT.
>> Carson: OH, YOU DO?
>> YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M PRETTY QUICK LIKE THAT.
>> Carson: WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT 
IF I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO ALL MY 
GUESTS OUR HORRIBLE HUMOR?
>> YEAH.
>> Carson: ASIDE FROM YOU BEING 
A WONDERFUL ACTRESS, I THOUGHT 
IT WAS INTERESTING, I WAS 
READING ABOUT YOU, THAT YOU'RE 
REALLY INTO ART.
>> OH, YEAH.
I JUST HAD A SHOW IN 
NOVA SCOTIA, MY THIRD SHOW.
HALIFAX.
>> Carson: WHERE'S THAT?
IN CANADA?
>> YES, CANADA.
IT'S NORTH --
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OKAY, WE'VE GOT SOME 
CANADIANS HERE.
>> Carson: WHAT SORT OF SHOW 
WAS IT?
>> IT'S AN ART SHOW WITH 
PHOTOGRAPHY AND MIXED MEDIA, AND
SOME PAINTINGS.
>> Carson: AND THAT'S THE TYPE 
OF ART THAT YOU DO?
IT'S MIXED MEDIA?
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I STARTED DOING
PHOTOGRAPHS AND COLLAGE.
AND THEN I'VE SORT OF BEEN 
WORKG 
DRAWING AND --
AND THEN THERE'S ONE PIECE, THAT
HAS INK AND WATERCOLOR.
>> Carson: RIGHT.
>> AND THEN, THE OTHER PIECES 
ARE OIL PAINTINGS.
>> Carson: VERY CONFUSING.
>> YES.
>> Carson: BUT I'M SURE LOVELY.
>> VERY CONFUSING.
I'LL SEND YOU A BROCHURE.
>> Carson: YOU SHOOT THE 
PHOTOGRAPHY YOURSELF?
>> I DO, YEAH.
>> Carson: AND THEN YOU SIT 
DOWN, MAYBE WITH, LIKE, A 
CANVAS, AND YOU TAKE ALL THE 
PICTURES OF MAYBE LOS ANGELES, 
AND YOU JUST LAY THEM OUT.
AND THEN, YOU PUT THE INK 
AROUND THEM?
AND THEN CUT OUT MAGAZINES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
GET THE GLUE.
>> IF I WERE IN KINDERGARTEN.
YEAH, IT'S SORT OF --
>> Carson: AND THEN SORT OF PUT 
IT DOWN.
>> I ACTUALLY, I TAKE THE 
PHOTOGRAPHS, AND THEN I'LL SORT 
OF FIGURE OUT WHAT, YOU KNOW, 
INSPIRES ME.
AND THEN I'LL GO FROM THERE.
AND I WILL CUT UP SOME OF THE 
PHOTOGRAPHS.
LIKE, I HAVE ONE PIECE THAT IS A
TRIPTYCH, AND THE PHOTOGRAPHS 
ARE WEAVED WITHIN EACH OTHER.
>> Carson: SURE.
>> SO THAT THEY ARE BRAIDED IN 
TO -- AND THEN, AROUND THE 
FRAME, I PAINTED THAT.
AND THEN, 
WELDED THIS THING TOGETHER --
>> Carson: YEAH.
>> -- AND THEN HANG THEM 
ON THAT.
>> Carson: WELL, CLEARLY, YOU'RE
SMARTER THAN ME.
I THINK WE ESTABLISHED THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
'CAUSE YOU SAID FOUR WORDS, I 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT.
>> TRIPTYCH?
>> Carson: YEAH.
AND THEN --
>> WELDING?
>> Carson: YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WHOA!
>> Carson: YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.
"KILL BILL" WAS SUCH A 
GREAT MOVIE.
I THINK FOR SO MANY PEOPLE THAT 
WATCH THE SHOW, LOVE, LOVE -- 
EVERYBODY LOVED THAT MOVIE.
WAS THAT -- ?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THERE'S EVEN QUITE A FEW THINGS 
COMING UP, WHICH WE'LL GET TO IN
A SECOND.
BUT THAT MOVIE, JUST SEEMED 
LIKE -- WAS AS THAT MUCH FUN TO 
JUST SHOOT, AS IT WAS FOR US 
TO WATCH?
>> IT WAS REALLY
IT WAS GREAT.
I MEAN, THE THING IS, IS THAT 
WHEN YOU WORK WITH QUENTIN, WHO 
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW VERY WELL, 
HE'S GOT SO MUCH ENERGY AND SO 
MUCH IMPROVISATION WHEN HE'S 
ON SET.
SO WHEN YOU GET THERE, YOU DON'T
RE KNOW WHAT'S GOING 
TO HAPPEN.
>> Carson: HE'S OUT HERE FOR, 
LIKE, SEVEN MINUTES DOING THE 
INTERVIEW WITH ME, AND I DON'T 
GET A WORD IN.
>> YEAH, IT'S A MONOLOGUE.
>> Carson: I CAN'T IMAGINE, IF 
ON A SET IN HOLLYWOOD FOR LIKE, 
YOU KNOW, A 16-HOUR DAY, IT'S 
HIM JUST GOING CRAZY.
>> YEAH. 
HE'S GOT SO MUCH ENERGY.
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE KNOWS 
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, BUT HE 
DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO STICK 
WITH IT.
SO HE CAN, SORT OF, PLAY WITH 
WHATEVER HE WANTS.
AND, YOU KNOW -- THE HEAD THING,
THE HEAD CUTTING-OFF THING WAS 
PRETTY MAJOR.
>> Carson: YEAH.
>> YEAH.
>> Carson: YOU SHOULD WORK THAT 
INTO YOUR COLLAGE ART, SOMEHOW.
>> PART OF MY HEAD, YEAH.
>> Carson: EXPLAIN "LUCKY NUMBER
SLEVIN," THE NEW FILM THAT 
YOU'RE IN NOW.
>> OKAY, THAT'S A MOVIE THAT IS 
SORT OF A MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
LIKE BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE AT
THE WRONG TIME.
SO IT'S GOT A LITTLE NOIIN I
IT'S GOT MYSTERY.
>> Carson: OKAY, DUMB IT DOWN 
FOR ME NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> IT'S NOT -- ACTUALLY, YOU'VE 
GOTTA GO IN -- YOU'VE GOTTA 
ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION AND THINK
ABOUT IT.
SO I'M NOT SURE IF IT'THE 
MOVIE FOR YOU.
[ LAUGHTER AND OHS ]
>> Carson: YEAH, YOU'RE 
PROB
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.
SHE'S RIGHT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HEY, MAN, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, 
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW?
I LIKE POP-UP BOOKS, WHAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU OPEN IT, IT'S RIGHT THERE.
NO READING AT ALL.
IT IS A COMPLICATED PLOT, 
THOUGH.
>> IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN 
ANY OF THE -- YOU KNOW, LIKE 
WITH "CHARLIE'S ANGELS."
>> Carson: YEAH.
GO SEE THAT, IT'S A GREAT FILM.
[ LAUGHTER ] 
THIS MOVIE'S GOT -- 
JOSH HARTNETT'S IN IT.
SIR BEN KINGSLEY, 
MORGAN FREEMAN, BRUCE WILLIS.
IT'S A HUGE CAST.
YOU HAD IT PREMIERED 
AT SUNDANCE?
>> YEAH.
WELL, IT'S AN INDEPENDENT MOVIE.
AND SO SUNDANCE PREMIERED IT 
THERE, WHICH WAS GREAT.
I HAD NEVER BEEN TO SUNDANCE, 
EITHER.
>> Car
SUNDANCE AS LIKE, JUST A 
PLATFORM FOR AN INDIE FILM THAT 
IS LOOKING FOR DISTRIBUTION, OR 
LOOKING FOR A BREAK TO GET 
OUT THERE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Carson: AND THEN, JUST LIKE 
THIS MONSTER FILM WITH ALL THESE
GREAT ACTORS.
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT WAS REALLY COOL.
AND THE THING IS, IT ALREADY HAD
BEEN SOLD, SO THERE WAS 
NO PRESSURE.
AND SO WE WERE JUST THERE FOR 
THE -- I FIRST SAW IT FOR THE 
FIRST TIME WITH AN AUDIENCE.
>> Cso
DID YOU LIKE GOING TO SUNDANCE?
WAS THAT FUN FOR YOU?
>> YEAH, IT WAS REALLY FUN.
I'D NEVER BEEN THERE.
AND PEOPLE ARE GREAT.
I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY FUN.
>> Carson: ARE THE GIFT BAGS 
REALLY THAT BIG OF A DEAL?
>> Joe: YEAH.
>> WHO SAID "YES"?
>> Carson: JOE FIRSTMAN, AND HE 
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE HAS NEVER BEEN TO SUNDANCE.
HE DOESN'T KNOW -- WHERE IS 
SUNDANCE?
WHAT STATE?
>> Joe: MONTANA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Carson: YOU'RE LIKE A 
KEEBLER ELF.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.
YOU LIVE IN LIKE, A TREE, AND 
MAKE MUSIC.
[ AUDIENCE OHS ]
>> THAT'S ROUGH.
>> Carson: ARE THEY THAT BIG OF 
A DEAL.
>> HE JUST TOOK A HIT.
>> Carson: YEAH, THAT'S 
ALL RIGHT.
HE'S COMING BACK TOMORROW, 
TO HOST.
>> WHAT WAS I SAYING?
>> Carson: DOESN'T MATTER.
WASN'T IMPORTANT.
THEY RARELY ARE ON THIS SHOW.
THIS IS DESIGNED FOR YOU TO 
COME, CHANGE A FEW TIMES, HANG 
OUT, AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH THIS 
CLIP FROM "LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN."
DO YOU NEED TO SET THIS UP?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
>> WELL, THE CHARACTER THAT I 
PLAY TALKS A LOT, AND VERY FAST.
AND THINKS CONSTANTLY.
AND SHE THINKS SHE'S A 
SUPER SLEUTH.
SO --
>> Carson: OKAY.
>> I THINK THIS IS A SCENE WHERE
SHE GOES ON A DATE WITH HIM.
>> Carson: OKAY.
IF IT'S NOT -- THIS SHOW'S NOT 
LIVE, SO WE CAN REDO IT.
>> WE CAN JUST -- YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Carson: WE'LL SUB IN THE 
RIGHT CLIP, NO MATTER WHAT 
IT IS.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Carson: LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>> YOU WON'T EVEN USE ME.
YOU'LL HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE.
>> Carson: OH, BELIEVE ME, 
I'LL BE --
IT'LL BE JUST LIKE -- IT'LL 
BE CONAN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT HERE.
AND HE CAN BE ME.
LIKE, REALLY SMART, INTELLIGENT 
QUESTIONS, AND YOUR ANSWERS.

>> WE'LL, I'LL GO OVER AND SAY, 
"HI, MY NAME IS SLEVIN.
I KNOW YOU THINK I'MOM
THAT I'M NOT.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE YOU OUT, 
OR THEY TAKE ME OUT.
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING, YOU 
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?"
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.
>> YOU THINK?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Carson: FAST TALKER.
YOU'RE A SWEETHEART TO BE HERE.
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION QUICKLY, 
"CHARLIE'S ANGELS 3."
JUST "YES" OR "NO."

>> I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT.
>> Carson: OKAY, GOOD.
>> I DON'T -- I MEAN, I WISH I 
COULD, YOU KNOW --

MY NAME IS SARAH.
I'VE HAD A SLEEP PROBLEM.
ACTUALLY, DIFFERENT PROBLEMS.
SOMETIMES I COULDN'T
FALL ASLEEP.
OR I'D FALL ASLEEP
AND I COULDN'T STAY ASLEEP.
MY DOCTOR SUGGESTED
THAT I TRY AMBIEN CR,
THE LATEST AMBIEN.
IT DOES BOTH.
HELPS ME FALL ASLEEP...
AND STAY ASLEEP.
IT'S THE ONLY ONE
WITH TWO LAYERS.
ONE DISSOLVES QUICKLY
TO HELP YOU FALL ASLEEP FAST.
THE OTHER DISSOLVES SLOWLY
TO HELP YOU STAY ASLEEP.
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.
[ Announcer ] AMBIEN CR
IS A TREATMENT OPTION...
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
CAN CONSIDER...
ALONG WITH LIFESTYLE CHANGES...
AND CAN BE TAKEN FOR AS LONG
AS YOUR DOCTOR RECOMMENDS.
UNTIL YOU KNOW
HOW AMBIEN CR WILL AFFECT YOU,
YOU SHOULDN'T DRIVE
OR OPERATE MACHINERY.
BE SURE YOU'RE ABLE TO DEVOTE
7 TO 8 HOURS TO SLEEP...
BEFORE BEING ACTIVE AGAIN.
SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE
NEXT-DAY DROWSINESS,
DIZZINESS AND HEADACHE.
IT'S NON-NARCOTIC:
HOWEVER,
LIKE MOST SLEEP MEDICINES,
IT HAS SOME RISK
OF DEPENDENCY.
DON'T TAKE IT
WITH ALCOHOL.
[ Woman ]
FALLING ASLEEP
AND STAYING ASLEEP.
BOTH PROBLEMS HANDLED.
ASK YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT AMBIEN CR.
REMEMBER, THAT'S CR...
FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
FROM START TO FINISH.
IT'S READY.

>> THIS IS THE BRAND-NEW STYLE 
SKATEBOARD YOU CAN BUY.
IT COMBINES SURFING, 
SNOWBOARDING, AND SKATEBOARDING 
INTO ONE EXTREME SPORT.
>> Conan: SO IT COMBINES THREE 
THINGS I CAN'T DO INTO ONE 
INCREDIBLE TOY I HAVE NO USE 
FOR?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
START TWISTING THAT BOARD BACK 
AND FORTH.
>> Conan: OKAY.
>> ALL RIGHT, AND I'M GONNA HOLD
THIS ARM.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ON TO MY 
SHOULDER.
>> Conan: DOES IT LOOK LESS COOL
WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO ME?
>> A LITTLE LESS.
>> Conan: WHY ARE WE HEADED 
TOWARDS AN ESCALATOR?
IT'S JUST A BAD IDEA.

EXPENSIVE ITEMS IN THE STORE.

>> YEP.
$300,000.
>> Conan: WHAT IS IT?
>> IT'S A 3-D MOTION SIMULATOR.
WHEN YOU GET INTO THE CAPSULE, 
THERE'S A FLAT-SCREEN MONITOR.
AND WHATEVER'S ON THE SCREEN 
SIMULATES ON THE RIDE.
>> Conan: HAS ANYONE EVER JOINED
THE MILE-HIGH CLUB IN HERE, IF 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
IF THE SIMULATOR'S ROCKIN', 
DON'T BOTHER KNOCKIN'!

"OLD SCHOOL" AND "THE ROYAL 
TENENBAUMS."

SEEN IN THE NEW MOVIE "THE 
FAMILY STONE."
PLEASE WELCOME LUKE WILSON.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: HOW ARE YA?
>> I'M GOOD.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Conan: HEY, THANKS FOR BEING 
HERE.
YEAH.
THIS IS NICE.
NOW, DON'T YOU -- AM I WRONG?
I WAS TALKING AT THE TOP OF THE 
SHOW ABOUT THE, THE SORT OF, 
SPIRIT IN THE CITY RIGHT NOW, 
YOU'RE STARTING TO FEEL IT, THAT
HOLIDAY SPIRIT.
>> I FEEL IT.
IT'S VERY CROWDED, IT'S TOUGH TO
GET AROUND.
>> Conan: YEAH.
WELL, THAT'S NOT QUITE WHAT I 
WAS TALKING ABOUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M LIKE, "HOLIDAY SPIRIT."
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "YEAH, YOU'RE 
RIGHT, IT'S REAL CROWDED.
I HATE IT."
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE HERE -- YOU'RE LIVING 
HERE NOW, IS THAT RIGHT?
>> I AM.
>> Conan: TEMPORARILY?
>> YEAH, I'M HERE WORKING ON A 
MOVIE, YEAH.
>> Conan: OKAY.
SO, YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'RE HANGING OUT IN NEW YORK 
CITY.
WHERE -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET 
SPECIFIC, I KNOW YOU GOTTA -- 
YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE AWAY YOUR 
PRIVACY.
>> OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
"THE POST" PRINTS WHERE YOU 
LIVE.
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: OH, GOOD, OKAY.
>> BUT, I LIVE DOWN IN THE 
DOWNTOWN AREA.
ACTUALLY --
>> Conan: LIKE THE COOL DOWNTOWN
AREA?
>> YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
GONNA GET A PLACE, I WOULD 
RECOMMEND GOING NOT ONLY IN THE 
DAY AND THE NIGHT BUT ALSO, 
LIKE, THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
I WORKED A LOT OF NIGHTS AND MY 
NEIGHBORHOOD TURNS INTO KIND OF 
A TRANNY AREA, TRANSVESTITE 
AREA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: ALL NIGHT.
A LOT OF TRANSVESTITES HANGING 
AROUND IN SPECIFIC AREAS.
>> YES, INCREDIBLE WORK ETHIC 
THEY HAVE.
LIKE, YOU KNOW --
[ LAUGHTER ]
SNOW, RAIN, I MEAN THEY'RE 
ALWAYS OUT.
>> Conan: OH, YEAH, THEY'RE LIKE
THE POSTMAN, YEAH.
THEY DON'T CARE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YEAH, PROBABLY THE WORST 
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD YOU CAN MAKE
EYE CONTACT WITH.
>> Conan: OKAY.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHY ARE YOU 
MAKING A LOT OF EYE CONTACT WITH
THEM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WELL, YOU GO BY AND YOU 
THINK, "IS THAT A MAN OR A 
WOMAN?"
AND ACTUALLY A NICE FIGURE.
AND THEN --
>> Conan: AND YOUR EYES LOCK?
>> YEAH, AND THEN YOUR EYES 
LOCK.
>> Conan: ROMANTIC MUSIC STARTS 
TO PLAY.
>> KIND OF A NIGHTMARISH 
MONA LISA QUALITY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: WELL, THESE ARE ALL 
NICE HOLIDAY STORIES.
>> YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: NOW, I UNDERSTAND, I 
HOPE YOU'RE OKAY, BUT SOMEONE 
TOLD ME YOU HAD A HEALTH SCARE 
NOT TOO LONG AGO.
I HOPE -- YOU SEEM FINE NOW.
>> NO, IT WASN'T REALLY --
THE MOVIE I'M WORKING ON, I WAS 
GETTING DIRECTED BY THE 
DIRECTOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I HAD KIND OF A PAIN IN MY 
CHEST, WHERE I WAS JUST -- I 
WENT "AHH," LIKE THAT.
AND EVERYTHING STOPPED.
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WAS LIKE, 
"HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?"
AND HE STOPPED DIRECTING ME AND 
I THOUGHT, "THIS COULD BE A 
GREAT THING TO USE IN YOUR 
LIFE."
JUST TO PRETEND LIKE YOU HAVE 
SOME KIND OF PAIN IN YOUR CHEST.
SO, I'VE JUST STARTED USING IT.
LIKE, ANY TIME THINGS GET 
UNCOMFORTABLE -- "AHH!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
LIKE, IF YOU'RE IN A 
RELATIONSHIP.
LIKE, ASK ME -- SAY YOU AND I 
ARE GOING OUT.
>> Conan: OKAY, YEAH.
LET'S SAY I'M A TRANSVESTITE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> ASK ME ABOUT THE FUTURE.
>> Conan: OKAY.
[ IN A HIGH PITCHED VOICE ]
WELL, LUKE, I MEAN -- WHERE'S 
THIS GOING?
>> AHH!
OH, NO.
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT NOW.
>> Conan: OH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, THAT'S COOL AND THEN 
EVERYTHING'S DONE.
>> I ACTUALLY DID IT TOO EARLY.
>> Conan: YOU DID IT TOO EARLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN ASKING,
LIKE, WHERE DO YOU WANNA EAT 
TONIGHT?
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "AHH!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I KNOW, THAT IS THE PROBLEM, 
YOU CAN OVERDO IT.
>> Conan: YOU WENT TOO SOON.
YEAH, YEAH, THAT WAS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I DIDN'T EVEN WANNA GO THERE.
AS THE KIDS SAY.
NOW, A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING 
WELL.
FIRST OF ALL, IN THIS MOVIE THAT
YOU'RE SHOOTING, YOU'RE WORKING 
WITH THE AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL 
UMA THURMAN.
WHO I'VE HAD HERE ON THE SHOW 
AND SHE'S -- IT'S STUNNING IN 
PERSON, WHEN YOU SEE HER.
I MEAN, SHE'S STUNNING ON THE 
SCREEN, BUT EQUALLY STUNNING IN 
PERSON.
>> IT IS.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE 
OTHER ACTRESSES I'VE WORKED 
WITH, SHE'S REALLY -- SHE'S 
PROBABLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 
WOMAN I'VE EVER MET.
BUT ACCESSIBLE, TOO.
YOU KNOW?
KIND OF LIKE A NATIONAL PARK.
LIKE YELLOWSTONE OR SOMETHING.
YOU JUST KINDA WANNA --
>> Conan: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT IT -- 
I'M NOT REALLY MAKING SENSE.
>> Conan: NO, NO.
IT ACTUALLY DOES.
I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT 
SHE'S EXTREMELY, LIKE 
YELLOWSTONE, SHE'S EXTREMELY 
BEAUTIFUL, BUT YOU CAN --
>> YOU CAN TALK TO HER.
SHE'S A GREAT PERSON, TOO.
SHE'S NOT JUST, YOU KNOW?
SHE IS STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL.
>> Conan: RIGHT.
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T BUILD A 
CAMPFIRE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> AS LONG AS YOU DON'T TRY AND 
DRIVE A WINNEBAGO ON HER.
>> Conan: YEAH.
IT'S A METAPHOR THAT DOESN'T 
HOLD UP TO TOO MUCH PRESSURE, 
SCRUTINY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW YOU -- YOU'VE WORKED WITH SO
MANY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
AND CLEARLY, YOU LIKE THE 
LADIES.
BUT, YOU DON'T LIKE LOVE SCENES,
YOU DON'T LIKE SHOOTING A LOVE 
SCENE.
WHY?
>> WELL, IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T 
LIKE THEM.
BUT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS LIKE, 
"MAN, THAT MUST BE FUN TO DO 
THAT."
BUT IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE 
YOU GOT A BUNCH OF GUYS AROUND 
AND I'M ALWAYS TOLD THAT I DON'T
MOVE ENOUGH DURING LOVE SCENES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING 
THE LOVE SCENE --
>> TO HAVE ROB REINER SAY, "COME
ON, BUDDY, YOU GOTTA MOVE A 
LITTLE MORE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: THAT'S GOTTA BE 
CREEPY.
>> AND IT LEADS INTO YOUR LIFE 
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU START 
THINKING ABOUT ROB REINER, YOU 
KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS THEY SAY IN GOLF, "THAT'S NOT
A GOOD SWING."
>> Conan: YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT 
HIS HEAD COMING UP WHILE YOU'RE,
YOU KNOW, IN THE ZONE.
AND, YEAH, THAT'S WEIRD.
BUT ALSO, THEY'RE NOT REALLY --
IT LOOKS ON-SCREEN LIKE THEY'RE 
NAKED, BUT THEY'RE NOT NAKED.
>> NO, THEY'RE NOT.
AND THEY DO -- ACTRESSES, AND I 
DO LIKE ACTRESSES.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY TAPE 
THEMSELVES UP AND SAY THE 
CAMERA'S BEHIND THEM AND --
>> Conan: RIGHT.
>> JUST, IT MAKES YOU 
UNCOMFORTABLE.
MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.
>> Conan: YEAH, YEAH.
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE 
YOU'RE JUST IN THIS GREAT MOMENT
OF ECSTASY.
IT'S GOTTA BE VERY COMPLICATED.
I WISH I COULD DO IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, ANYWAY, MOVING ON.
YOU HAVE THIS NEW FILM, "THE 
FAMILY STONE."
WHAT IS YOUR ROLE IN THIS FILM?
WHO DO YOU PLAY?
>> I PLAY KIND OF THIS STONER 
BROTHER.
IT'S KIND OF A VERY UPTIGHT 
NEW ENGLAND FAMILY.
AND I PLAY KIND OF A 
BOHEMIAN-TYPE GUY THAT'S KIND OF
A FREE-WHEELING.
>> Conan: RIGHT, RIGHT.
YOU'RE LOOSE.
YOU'RE IN TOUCH WITH YOUR OWN 
INNER VIBE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU CAN TELL I'M VERY UPTIGHT.
THAT'S HOW I DESCRIBE IT.
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE LOOSE GUYS, 
WHO'S IN TOUCH WITH HIS VIBES.
>> YEAH, YOU REALLY HAD ME 
THERE.
I WAS LIKE --
>> Conan: I'M CLEARLY HAVING A 
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
>> I AM IN TOUCH WITH MY INNER 
VIBE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THAT MEANS.
IT SOUNDS DIRTY.
WE HAVE A CLIP HERE.
TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
>> IT'S ME AND SARAH JESSICA 
PARKER.
SHE PLAYS MY B BROTHER'S FIANCEE.
AND SHE'S JUST HAVING -- THE 
FAMILY'S BEING TOUGH ON HER.
AND I JUST TAKE HER OUT FOR A 
BEER TO TRY AND, KIND OF, GET 
HER TO RELAX A LITTLE BIT.
>> Conan: TELL HER TO CHILL OUT 
A LITTLE BIT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CLIP 
FROM "THE FAMILY STONE."
>> STOP.
STOP TRYING.
IT'S EXHAUSTING.
TRYING TO KEEP THAT LID SCREWED 
ON SO TIGHT.
JUST --
YOU KNOW, RELAX.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: VERY RELAXED GUY.
THAT'S THE WAY TO SHOW SOMEONE 
HOW TO RELAX.
CHILL OUT.
YOU COULD HELP ME.
"THE FAMILY STONE" OPENS NEXT 
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 16th.
AND YOU'RE LIVING HERE IN 
NEW YORK CITY.
I'LL PROBABLY SEE YOU AROUND.
>> THAT'D BE GREAT.
WHAT'S YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?
>> Conan: STATEN ISLAND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE, 
ACTUALLY.
I WALK ALL AROUND.
I'M LIKE BIG BIRD UP THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M VERY EASY TO SPOT.
I GO ALONG, I'VE GOT LIKE THE 
NINE-FOOT HAIRCUT AND I'M LIKE, 
"HEY, EVERYBODY, HOW ARE YA?"
KIDS ARE LIKE, "LOOK, IT'S ONE 
OF THE MUPPETS.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, JUST GIVE A SHOUT OUT.
>> I WILL.
>> Conan: HEY, THANKS FOR BEING 
HERE AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
JACK KLUGMAN'S COMING UP, STICK 
AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
COMING TO A DINNER TABLE
NEAR YOU!
IT'S HOT, IT'S STEAMY,
AND THE CRITICS LOVE IT!
THE NEW TUSCAN CHICKEN SANDWICH,
HOT AND FRESH FROM THE OVEN.
DON'T MISS IT!
SUBWAY.
EAT FRESH!
WE MAKE 18
AWARD-WINNING
STYLES OF
SAMUEL ADAMS.
WHAT?
GET OUT.
PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT.
SOME PEOPLE
LIKE THEIR BEER
MAYBE WITH A
LEMONY TOUCH TO IT.
I LIKE A
REALLY HOPPY BEER,
SOMETHING JUST WITH
A LOT OF TASTE.
SAM LIGHT IS MY DRINK.
BOSTON ALE.
BLACK LAGER.
PALE ALE.
WINTER LAGER.
CHERRY WHEAT.
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE WHITE ALE.
IF I WAS
PICKING ONE BEER
TO TAKE WITH ME
ON A DESERT ISLAND,
IT WOULD BE SAMUEL
ADAMS BOSTON LAGER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, 
WE ARE BACK.
MY NEXT GUEST STARRED IN THE HIT
TV SHOWS "THE ODD COUPLE" AND 
"QUINCY."
NOW HE HAS THIS NEW BOOK OUT 
ENTITLED "TONY AND ME: A STORY 
OF FRIENDSHIP."
PLEASE WELCOME JACK KLUGMAN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: YEAH!
THAT'S NICE.
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE
STORY.
GROWING UP, I WAS VERY 
INTERESTED IN COMEDY.
MY DAD HAS GREAT COMEDY TASTE, 
AND ONE OF THE SHOWS HE LET US 
STAY UP AND WATCH WAS 
"THE ODD COUPLE."
>> WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL.
WHEN WE WERE SHOOTING THE SHOW, 
WE WERE LOOKING FOR RATINGS.
FORGET MY VOICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S NIELSON.
>> Conan: RIGHT, THE SHOW WAS 
NOT A HIT SHOW, AND I WAS NOT 
AWARE OF THAT.
YOU DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT RATINGS 
WHEN YOU WERE A KID, YOU JUST 
WATCHED WHAT YOU LOVED.
>> BUT, WHEN I JUST WENT OUT ON 
A BOOK TOUR, I MET ALL THESE 
PEOPLE WHO SAID, "I GREW UP WITH
YOU.
I SAT ON THE COUCH WITH MY 
MOTHER AND MY FATHER, AND WE 
LAUGHED AT YOU."
AND NOW THOSE NIELSON PEOPLE 
THAT HAD NO FACES AND NAMES.
I HAD THE GREATEST TIME.
I THOUGHT I'D BE BORED, I HAD A 
GREAT TIME.
>> Conan: I THINK WHAT'S AMAZING
IS YOU MAKE THE SHOW, AND YOU 
DON'T GET OUT AND ACTUALLY -- IT
TAKES TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT 
EFFECT YOU HAD ON PEOPLE.
>> BUT YOU DON'T THINK YOU HAVE 
ANY EFFECT.
PEOPLE BECAME SPORTSWRITERS 
BECAUSE I WAS A SPORTSWRITER.
PEOPLE BECAME PATHOLOGISTS WHEN 
I DID "QUINCY."
>> Conan: RIGHT.
PEOPLE COMMITTED MURDERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU INSPIRED ME TO MURDER.
>> THEY SAY, "MY SHOULDER HURTS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
I SAY, "I CAN ONLY HELP YOU 
AFTER YOU DIE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: YEAH, "AFTER YOU DIE, 
I'LL HELP YOU."
NOW, YOU HAD A VERY FAMOUS BRUSH
WITH THROAT CANCER.
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: AND IN THIS BOOK, YOU 
TALK ABOUT THE LATE, GREAT 
TONY RANDALL, WHO, BY THE WAY, 
WAS SUCH A GOOD FRIEND OF THIS 
SHOW.
WE PRETTY MUCH HAD OUR PICK OF 
WHOEVER WE WANTED WHEN WE HAD 
OUR FIRST SHOW GOING ON THE AIR 
IN SEPTEMBER OF '93, AND I 
WANTED TONY RANDALL THERE.
HE ALWAYS SPOKE SO HIGHLY OF 
YOU.
HE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF YOU 
WHEN YOU BECAME SICK.
>> WE HAD A GOOD FRIENDSHIP FOR 
THE FIVE YEARS WE WORKED AS THE 
ODD COUPLE.
WE HAD DONE A BOMB IN 1954.
WE DID A SHOW CALLED 
"APPOINTMENT WITH ADVENTURE," A 
REAL CLINKER STINKER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN I DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR ABOUT 
17 YEARS.
WE DID "THE ODD COUPLE," AND WE 
HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP FOR FIVE
YEARS.
WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS, WE'D 
BONDED, WENT OUT ON TOUR.
BUT WHEN YOU'RE SICK, WHEN YOU 
GET CANCER, THE RELATIONSHIP 
EITHER MOVES UP A NOTCH OR IT 
FALLS APART.
WELL, IT MOVED UP A NOTCH, 
BECAUSE WHEN I HAD THE 
OPERATION, HE WAS THE FIRST ONE 
TO VISIT ME IN THE HOSPITAL, 
BESIDE MY KIDS.
I SAID, "IT WAS WORSE THAN THEY 
THOUGHT.
I LOST MY VOICE!"
HE SAID, "LET'S FACE IT, JACK, 
YOU NEVER DID SOUND LIKE 
RICHARD BURTON ANYWAY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN HE SAID, "IF AND WHEN 
YOU'RE READY TO COME BACK, WE'LL
FIND A VENUE FOR YOU."
I SAID, "YEAH, YOUR GONNA FIND A
VENUE FOR AN ACTOR WITHOUT A 
VOICE."
BUT HE DID.
EVERY PROMISE HE EVER MADE TO 
ME, HE KEPT.
>> Conan: HE GOT YOU BACK ON 
STAGE, TOO.
>> HE GOT ME BACK ON STAGE.
BUT I HAD NO SOUND, I COULD JUST
WHISPER, SO AFTER ABOUT THREE 
YEARS, SOME GUY WHO SAW ME ON A 
TALK SHOW WHERE I SAID, "I'M NOT
GONNA DIE, I JUST CAN'T ACT 
ANYMORE" -- HE SAID, "I THINK I 
CAN GIVE YOU A VOICE."
I SAID, "ARE YOU A DOCTOR?"
HE SAID, "NO."
I SAID, "HOW ARE YOU GONNA HELP 
ME?"
HE SAID, "WHAT'VE YOU GOT TO 
LOSE?"
SO I WENT, AND HE GAVE ME VOICE 
EXERCISES.
THEN HE SAID, "I THINK I HEAR A 
SOUND."
I SAID, "I THINK YOU HEAR 
MONEY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
AND HE GAVE ME A SOUND.
THEN TONY CALLED ME AND SAID, 
"IF WE COULD DO ONE PERFORMANCE 
OF 'THE ODD COUPLE' ONSTAGE, I 
COULD RAISE $1 MILLION FOR MY 
THEATER."
I SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU SMOKIN'?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU ON THE 
TELEPHONE, FOR GOD'S SAKE."
SO I TOLD MY TEACHER, "TONY 
CALLED AND WANTS ME TO COME BACK
ON STAGE."
HE SAID, "TELL HIM IN SIX MONTHS
YOU CAN DO IT."
I SAID, "BUT --"
HE SAID, "TELL HIM."
SO I SAID, "MY TEACHER SAID IN 
SIX MONTHS I CAN DO IT."
TONY SAID, "FINE.
THAT GIVES ME TIME TO GET 
PUBLICITY."
AND I DID IT.
HE BROUGHT ME ON STAGE, AND I 
SAID, "THEY WON'T HEAR ME, 
TONY."
HE SAID, "I PROMISE YOU THEY'LL 
HEAR, THEY LOVE YOU.
I'LL MIKE YOU, THEY'LL HEAR YOU,
I PROMISE."
AND EVERY PROMISE HE MADE, HE 
KEPT.
I'M A DEPRESSION BABY, AND I 
NEVER LET ANYBODY INTO MY LIFE, 
EVEN MY KIDS, BUT HE TAUGHT ME 
HOW TO LET PEOPLE IN, 'CAUSE I 
TRUSTED HIM, AND HE NEVER LET ME
DOWN.
>> Conan: GOD BLESS HIM.
I WISH HE WAS STILL HERE WITH 
US.
[ APPLAUSE ]
THE INTERESTING THING -- I 
ALWAYS HAD THE IDEA -- I MEAN, 
YOU'RE A TERRIFIC ACTOR, BUT 
WHEN I WATCHED "THE ODD COUPLE,"
I THINK ALL OF US HAD THE IDEA 
THAT THERE WAS PART OF YOU THAT 
WAS OSCAR MADISON, THAT THERE 
WAS SOME OSCAR MADISON IN 
JACK KLUGMAN.
IS THAT TRUE?
>> ALL OF IT.
>> Conan: ARE YOU A SLOB?
>> WELL, I SHOWER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: AND I THANK YOU, YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> BUT I'M SLOPPY.
I LOVE TO GAMBLE, I GO TO THE 
RACETRACK EVERY CHANCE I GET.
AND I LOVE WOMEN.
AND I TRY TO LIVE A CAREFREE 
LIFE.
THAT'S OSCAR MADISON.
>> Conan: NOW, YOU ALSO, I'M 
TOLD -- IT WAS SORT OF A RUMOR, 
A LEGEND THAT THOSE WERE SOME OF
YOUR CLOTHES, THAT THE SLOPPY 
CLOTHES THAT YOU WORE ON THE 
SHOW AS OSCAR MADISON WERE 
ACTUALLY YOUR OWN CLOTHING.
>> WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS A 
COMPLIMENT.
THEY COULDN'T FIND THE CLOTHES 
THAT OSCAR WOULD WEAR, SO THEY 
CAME TO ME AND THEY SAID, "WE'D 
LIKE TO BUY YOUR WARDROBE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: "WE NEED SOME SLOPPY, 
CRAPPY CLOTHES."
>> I SOLD MY CLOTHES FOR $360, 
AND I MADE A PROFIT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN LATER ON, I FOUND OUT IT 
WAS AN INSULT.
EVERY TIME I'D SEE THOSE 
CLOTHES, I'D SAY, "THEY'RE 
MINE."
>> Conan: YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?
THIS IS SUCH A COMMENT ON HOW 
MUCH TELEVISION HAS CHANGED, BUT
WHEN "THE ODD COUPLE" FIRST WENT
ON THE AIR, THE NETWORK WAS VERY
NERVOUS ABOUT TWO SINGLE MEN 
LIVING TOGETHER.
>> OH, YEAH.
WELL, THE FIRST 15 SHOWS WE DID 
ON ONE CAMERA, WITH NO AUDIENCE,
SO WE HUGGED AND KISSED A LOT 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD SEE IT.
THE EXECUTIVES WOULD SAY, 
"THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT ON 
THE SHOW, ARE THEY?"
AND JERRY BELSON SAID, "I DON'T 
KNOW, THEY MIGHT."
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHY IT HAD THOSE 
BEGINNINGS WHERE THEIR WIVES 
SAID WHY THEY THREW US OUT.
>> Conan: RIGHT, THEY NEEDED A 
LOT OF EXPLANATION.
>> THEY THOUGHT THAT TWO GUYS 
LIVING TOGETHER, THEY MUST BE 
GAY OR SOMETHING.
TODAY, YOU CAN'T HAVE A 
SUCCESSFUL SHOW UNLESS YOU HAVE 
A GAY PERSON ON IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: I KNOW, YEAH.
THANK YOU, LaBAMBA.
[ AUDIENCE OHs ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TOO MUCH FUN.
I'M SORRY, LaBAMBA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU AT 
CHRISTMAS.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO ASK YOU ALSO
ABOUT "QUINCY."
WHEN "QUINCY" FIRST CAME ON THE 
AIR, A SHOW ABOUT A MEDICAL 
EXAMINER, AND IT WAS QUITE 
UNUSUAL.
NOW, THE OTHER COMMENT YOU COULD
MAKE IS YOU CAN'T TURN THE TV 
DIAL WITHOUT SEEING A MEDICAL 
EXAMINER SHOW.
THEY'RE SUCH A HUGE HIT.
YOU PAVED THE ROAD.
>> NOBODY KNEW WHAT A MEDICAL 
EXAMINER WAS.
FRED SILVERMAN -- HE WAS A BIG 
SHOT AT ONE TIME -- AND HE 
WANTED ME TO DO A SERIES AFTER 
"THE ODD COUPLE," A COMEDY 
SERIES.
I SAID, "I ALREADY DID THE BEST 
COMEDY SERIES I COULD DO," SO I 
TURNED HIM DOWN.
THEN I DID "QUINCY."
HE CALLED MY AGENT AND SAID, 
"JACK TURNS ME DOWN, NOW HE'S 
PLAYING AN UNDERTAKER?"
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.
SO I WAS GLAD TO BE AN 
INNOVATOR, BUT I WANTED ALWAYS 
TO BE A MUCKRAKER LIKE 
UPTON SINCLAIR.
I WANTED TO CLEAN UP THE COAL 
MINES AND THE SLAUGHTER HOUSES, 
AND THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
DO IT.
HE'S TWO HEROES IN ONE -- HE'S A
COP AND HE'S A DOCTOR, SO I 
THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE IT GOOD.
BUT THE GUY THAT CREATED THE 
SHOW, WROTE "COPS AND ROBBERS," 
AND I HATED THAT SHOW, SO HE 
PROMISED ME THAT HE WAS GONNA 
MAKE ME A REAL GUY THAT CREATES 
GOOD ATMOSPHERES, THAT TAKES 
CARE OF THESE BAD THINGS THAT 
HAPPEN.
HE NEVER DID, HE MADE IT 
"COPS AND ROBBERS."
SO FINALLY THE RATINGS WERE 
GOOD, AND I QUIT.
HE SAID, "YOU CAN'T QUIT.
WE'LL SUE YOU."
I SAID, "SUE ME, I DON'T WANT TO
DO THIS CRAP."
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO THEY SUED ME, BUT THE RATINGS
WERE GOOD.
THEY SAID, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?"
I SAID, "I WANT HIM FIRED."
THEY SAID, "BUT HE'S CREATED THE
SHOW."
I SAID, "I DON'T CARE.
HE'S NOT DOING WHAT I WANT.
I WANT HIM OUT."
BUT HE WAS SMART.
HE GOT A LOT OF MONEY TO GET OUT
OF THE SHOW.
ABOUT A YEAR LATER, I WAS AT A 
PARTY.
HE CAME OVER TO ME.
I SAID, "WHY DO YOU SAY HELLO?"
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE YOU."
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: WHO SAYS THAT?
>> "I DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU STAND 
FOR."
HE SAID, "STAY WELL, YOU'RE 
MAKING ME RICH."
>> Conan: VERY NICE, SO IT ALL 
ENDED NICELY.
YOU MADE HIM RICH AND YOU HATED 
HIS GUTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK, 
"TONY AND ME."
IT'S A STORY OF FRIENDSHIP, 
WHICH INCLUDES A DVD OF 
"THE ODD COUPLE" OUTTAKES, AND 
THAT'S IN STORES NOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERY NOW AND THEN, ON THIS 
SHOW, I GET TO MEET SOMEONE I'VE
ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET.
THIS IS A THRILL FOR ME.
>> OH, THANK YOU.
>> Conan: THANKS A LOT.
JACK KLUGMAN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH 
JASON HAWES AND GRANT WILSON.
STICK AROUND.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, 
WE'RE BACK.
EXCELLENT SHOW TONIGHT.
WE HAVE A FINE SHOW COMING UP 
TOMORROW NIGHT.
FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," 
TINA FEY IS GONNA BE JOINING ME.
[ CHEERS ]
YES INDEED.
FROM THE NEW FILM 
"THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA," 
WILLIAM MOSELEY WILL BE HERE.
AND MUSICAL GUEST JAMES BLUNT.
SO WATCH THAT SHOW.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
JASON HAWES AND GRANT WILSON 
WILL BE RIGHT HERE IN JUST A 
SECOND.
SO STICK AROUND.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: EVERYBODY, WE'RE BACK.
MY NEXT GUESTS TAKE CARE OF YOUR
PLUMBING BY DAY AND HUNT GHOSTS 
BY NIGHT.
THEY'RE ALSO THE STARS OF THE 
POPULAR SCI-FI SERIES 
"GHOST HUNTERS."
PLEASE WELCOME JASON HAWES AND 
GRANT WILSON.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Conan: NOW, FIRST OF ALL, 
EXPLAIN THIS BECAUSE YOU GUYS --
YOU HUNT FOR GHOSTS, YOU'RE 
GHOST HUNTERS.
BUT, YOU'RE ALSO -- YOU WORK FOR
ROTO-ROOTER, YOU'RE PLUMBERS.
IS THAT RIGHT?
>> YEAH, WE'RE PLUMBERS.
THAT'S OUR TRADE.
BUT WE INVESTIGATE CLAIMS OF THE
PARANORMAL.
>> Conan: OKAY.
>> VERY LITTLE GHOSTS INVOLVED.
WE DON'T HUNT MUCH, WE JUST TRY 
TO HELP PEOPLE FIGURE OUT IF 
THEIR PLACE IS HAUNTED OR NOT.
>> Conan: OKAY.
SO, DOES IT HAPPEN SOMETIMES 
THAT YOU'RE CALLED FOR A 
PLUMBING EMERGENCY AND THEN IT 
TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S A 
PARANORMAL EXPERIENCE?
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: OR VICE-VERSA, DO YOU 
EVER GO LOOKING FOR A PARANORMAL
EXPERIENCE AND FIX THE TOILET 
WHILE YOU'RE THERE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M CURIOUS HOW IT ALL WORKS.
>> IT'S FUNNY.
A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE HAD CASES
WHERE PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THEIR
DEAD UNCLE FRED IS FLUSHING THE 
TOILET AT 2:00 A.M.
AND YOU COME TO FIND OUT IT'S 
JUST A BAD FLAPPER VALVE IN THE 
TOILET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: WHICH CAN BE JUST AS 
SCARY.
MOST INQUIRIES, I'M TOLD, TURN 
UP NOTHING.
IS THAT RIGHT?
>> OVER 80% OF ALL CASES WE 
BELIEVE WE CAN DISPROVE.
>> Conan: SO, YOU'RE ALSO, 
YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN 
DEBUNKING.
PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING 
IS GOING ON AND YOU'LL COME AND 
YOU'LL SORT OF PROVE TO THEM, NO
THAT'S JUST THE CURTAIN BLOWING 
OR THAT'S A RAT, SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE
ONLY WAY TO GATHER TRUE EVIDENCE
AND TO HELP SOLIDIFY THINGS.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?
IS MOST OF THE TIMES WHEN YOU 
DEBUNK SOMETHING, IT'S EVEN MORE
FUNNY.
IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
LIKE, ONE TIME THIS LADY 
THOUGHT -- SHE FELT EYES ON HER 
ALL THE TIME.
SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS BEING 
WATCHED ALL THE TIME.
SEARCHING THE HOUSE AND WE FOUND
A STASH OF MARIJUANA, AND YOU 
KNOW, THERE'S YOUR GHOST RIGHT 
THERE.
>> Conan: RIGHT, RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, SHE WAS JUST PARANOID, YEAH.
>> YEAH.
>> Conan: WE'VE SOLVED THE 
CRIME.
YOU'RE HIGH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT, SO, WHAT ADVICE --
OKAY, LET'S SAY YOU THINK IT'S 
ONE OF THOSE 20% OCCASSIONS 
WHERE YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S SOME
PARANORMAL ACTIVITY OCCURRING.
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE PEOPLE?
WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM?
>> GET OUT.
>> Conan: YEAH, GET OUT!
>> IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF
CASE.
IF IT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A 
HUMAN-TYPE HAUNT.
OR, YOU KNOW, A RESIDUAL-TYPE 
HAUNT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS.
AN INTELLIGENT-TYPE HAUNTING IS 
LIKE ME AND YOU AFTER WE PASS.
AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF 
PSYCHICS CLAIM THAT THEY CAN 
COMMUNICATE WITH.
SO, A LOT OF TIMES THEY CAN HELP
GET IT OUT.
OR, THE FAMILY SITS AROUND THE 
TABLE AND TALKS AND ASKS IT TO 
LEAVE, THEY WANT THEIR HOME 
BACK.
IF IT'S A RESIDUAL-TYPE HAUNT, 
THEY COULD BE, THE ENERGY COULD 
BE TRAPPED IN ANYTHING.
IT COULD BE TRAPPED IN THE ROCKS
THAT MAKE UP THE BUILDING.
>> IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S TRICKY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: OKAY.
YOU GUYS -- DO YOU USE SPECIAL 
INSTRUMENTS?
I'M PICTURING "GHOST BUSTERS," 
BUT I'M TOLD THAT YOU GUYS DON'T
LIKE THE TERM "GHOST BUSTERS."
YOU HATE THE TERM "GHOST 
BUSTERS."
WHY?
>> BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING IN 
WITH A HOOVER STRAPPED TO US.
IT'S JUST, WHAT YOU NEED TO 
REMEMBER, WE'RE GOING IN TRYING 
TO --
>> Conan: WE'RE GOING IN WITH 
PLUMBING EQUIPMENT.
WE WANNA BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WE'RE PRETTY MUCH, WE'RE 
GOING IN TO TRY TO SEE WHAT THEY
BELIEVE AND TRY TO PUT A 
SCIENTIFIC SPIN ON IT.
TRY TO REALLY EXPLAIN IT.
BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS 
OUT THERE.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO ALL OVER 
THE WEB AND FIND PICTURES OF 
DUST THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ARE 
ORBS AND IT'S SPIRIT ACTIVITY.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT JUST REALLY 
HURTS THE FIELD.
>> Conan: RIGHT, RIGHT.
YOU SAY THAT, WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER
A PARANORMAL, I DON'T KNOW, 
SPIRIT OR ENERGY, THAT YOU GUYS 
SOMETIMES BELIEVE IN REALLY 
CONFRONTING IT.
IS THAT RIGHT?
>> IT IS.
HEAD ON.
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU'RE THERE AND EVEN IF 
SATAN'S IN THE HOUSE AND HE 
BEATS THE LIVING CRUD OUT OF 
YOU, IF YOU'VE GOT A CAMERA ON 
IT, HEY.
AT LEAST WE CAUGHT IT ON TAPE.
BUT YOU NEED TO ALSO REMEMBER 
THAT THE PARANORMAL, YOU KNOW, 
GHOSTS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
IT'S LIKE, WE DID A CASE FOR THE
COAST GUARD IN CONNECTICUT.
NOW, WE CAUGHT A CHAIR ON CAMERA
TURN AND SLIDE ABOUT 2 1/2 FEET 
ACROSS THE FLOOR.
IT WAS CAUGHT ON CAMERA.
>> Conan: WAS THE LIGHTHOUSE 
TIPPING OVER, MAYBE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> NO.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD DO TO
TRY TO DEBUNK THAT.
BUT, DID I SEE THE DEAD 
LIGHT-KEEPER MOVE THE CHAIR?
NO.
A CHAIR SLIDING BY ITSELF IS 
PARANORMAL.
MEANING, JUST ABOVE THE NORMAL.
>> Conan: PEOPLE TEND TO, WHEN 
THEY THINK ABOUT THESE KIND OF 
ACTIVITIES, THEY THINK OF 
SCOOBY-DOO AND, YOU KNOW WHAT I 
MEAN?
OR THEY THINK OF A GHOST THAT 
HAS A LONG BEARD THAT'S 
SAYING --
[ TALKING LIKE A GHOST ]
"I'LL GET YOU!"
AND WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TALKING 
ABOUT IS ENERGY OR SOMETHING 
THAT YOU CAN'T QUITE EXPLAIN.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU CATCH AN 
OBJECT MOVING, IT'S PARANORMAL.
PARA JUST MEANING ABOVE.
ABOVE THE NORMAL OF WHAT WE'RE 
USED TO.
>> Conan: DID YOU GUYS ALWAYS 
BELIEVE IN THIS, OR DID YOU COME
TO BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU GOT MORE 
AND MORE INTO IT?
WERE YOU SKEPTICS WHEN YOU 
STARTED OUT?
>> I'M STILL A SKEPTIC NOW, 
BELIEVING THAT OVER 80% OF THE 
CASES CAN BE DISPROVED.
BUT, YEAH, I HAD MY OWN 
EXPERIENCE.
IT'S JUST A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 
THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS 
ABOUT 20 THAT JUST MADE ME 
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS MORE 
OUT THERE.
>> Conan: WHAT WAS THAT?
>> IT WAS A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: BOO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT.
WELL -- THIS IS -- BUT YOU CATCH
SOME STUFF --
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCES 
WHERE PEOPLE TRY AND FOOL YOU.
IS THAT RIGHT?
WHERE PEOPLE CALL YOU GUYS AND 
SAY, "I'VE CAUGHT SOMETHING."
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT 
THEY'VE, YOU KNOW, TIED SOME 
FISHING LINE TO A PILLOW OR 
SOMETHING.
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH DOING
A TV SHOW NOW IS THAT PEOPLE 
WANNA BE ON TV.
AND SO, THEY'LL RIG THINGS UP.
AND WE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEONE WHO 
BUILT A SPEAKER INTO HIS WALL TO
TRY AND GET ON TV.
SO, THESE OMINOUS NOISES COMING 
FROM ONE PARTICULAR POINT IN THE
HOUSE.
>> BUT YOU ALSO GET A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY 
HAVE A PROBLEM --
>> Conan: MOST PEOPLE ARE THAT.
MOST PEOPLE AREN'T JUST 
DESPERATE TO GET ON TELEVISION.
MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVE 
SOMETHING IS GOING ON.
>> YEAH.
AND WE DID A CASE AT A LITTLE 
OLD LADY'S HOUSE WHO A HALF 
HOUR, 45 MINUTES AFTER SHE 
INVITED US IN BECAUSE SHE 
BELIEVED SHE HAD A SPIRIT IN HER
HOME, SHE CAME CHASING AFTER US 
WITH A FRYING PAN.
SHE TOTALLY FORGOT SHE INVITED 
US IN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Conan: SOMETHING STRONGER 
THAN MARIJUANA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OR TOO MUCH MARIJUANA.
>> Conan: YEAH, TOO MUCH, IT CAN
BE THE SAME THING.
"GHOST HUNTERS" AIRS FRIDAY 
NIGHTS AT 10:00 ON SCI-FI 
CHANNEL AND NEW EPISODES BEGIN 
IN MARCH.
GUYS, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING US.
>> Conan: PLEASURE DOING IT.
JASON HAWES, GRANT WILSON, WE'LL
TAKE A BREAK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

>>> TWO MEN WERE HURT, WHEN AN 
SUV DROVE STRAIGHT THROUGH A 
HOME NEAR DAYTON, OHIO.
NEIGHBORS QUICKLY PULLED A 
RESIDENT FROM THE DEBRIS, WHO'S 
LISTED IN SERIOUS CONDITION.
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE DRIVER 
MAY HAVE SUFFERED A SEIZURE AT 
THE TIME OF THE CRASH.
HE WAS TREATED FOR MINOR 
INJURIES.
>>> IT WAS A HAWTHORNE FAMILY 
REUNION IN CONCORD, 
MASSACHUSETTS, FOR THE DEAD AND 
LIVING.
ABOUT 40 DESCENDANTS OF FAMED 
WRITER NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE

OKAY.
ELISE IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING OF THE 
HEAT BIG TIME OUT WEST.

THAT'S BECAUSE THE STRONG RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE THAT LED TO 
RECORD-BREAKING TEMPERATURES 
ACROSS A GOOD PORTION OF THE 
PACIFIC NORTHWEST, WELL, THAT 
RIDGE IS WEAKENING.
SO AS A RESULT, THINGS MOSTLY 
CLEAR MANY IN THE SOUTHWEST. 
WE HAVE UNSETTLED WEATHER, BUT 
AS WE HEAD THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
CAN LEAD TO SOME AFTERNOON 
THUNDERSTORMS.
TEMPERATUREWISE, WE'LL START TO 
SEE THE COOL DOWN IN THE 
NORTHWEST, SO IN SEATTLE GET 
READY FOR SOME COOLER 
TEMPERATURES TODAY.
OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY AS FAR 
AS ACTIVE WEATHER IS CONCERNED 
IS STILL ALL OF THE VERY HEAVY 
RAIN IS RAIN WE'RE SEEING IN THE
INTERIOR NORTHEAST AND A MIX OF 
WEATHER OVER THE GREAT LAKES. 
SEVERE STORMS THERE, AS WELL AS 
ALONG THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST.
NATION'S MIDSECTION, RELATIVELY 
QUIET.
AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS CAN POP 
UP, SO WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON 
THAT.

NO PERSONAL FIREWORKS, NO DRUNK
DRIVING AND USE COMMON SENSE.
>> SECOND DEGREE SUNBURN, NOT
SHUTTLING YOUR FEET AT THE
BEACH.
STEPPING IO OR LETTING A CHILD
STEP INTO ONE OF THESE FIRE
RINGS TO SUFFER A CATASTROPHIC
BURN OR A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.
MOST OF THESE THINGS ARE
AVOIDABLE.
>> ADDITION TO TWO PARAMEDIC
BIKE TEAMS THAT WI BE ON THE
BEHES WITH THEM, ALL THE LIFE
SUPPORT EQUIPMENT THAT YOU WOULD
FIND IN AN AMBULANCE.
>> BAN FIREWORKS HAVE ALREADY
TURNED UP AT BORDER PORTS OF
ENTRY BRINGING FIREWORKS FROM
MEXICO TO THE U.S. IS ILLEGAL.
THEY SEE A LOT OF THAT THESE
DAYS.
ACCORDING TO U.S. COSTUME
SPOKESPERSON THAT IS CONSIDERED
SMUGGLING.
ANYONE CAUGHT COULD FACE FINES.
FIREWORKS FROM MEXICO COULD BE
UNPREDICTABLE AND DANGEROUS
ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN.
>>> THE HIGHWAY PATROL WILL BE
CRACKING DOWN ON ANYONE NOT
WEARING A SET BELT.
THEY WILL SHOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN

CALIFORNIA ROADS LAST WEEK WERE
NOT BUCKLED UP.
>>> WHAT KIND OF TRASH DO YOU
FIND ON THE HIGHWAYS?
CALTRANSORKERS SAY THEY FIND
ENOUGH FURNITURE ON HIGHWAYS
EACH MONTH TO FILL UP A SMA
HOUSE.
TH IS WHAT THE AGENCY DID
YESTERDAY TO PROVE THEIR POINT.
THE TRASH THAT FALLS FROM TRUCKS
OR TRUNK CAN BE UNSIGHTLYSIGHTLY AS
WELL AS DANGEROUS.
THEY ARE ASKING DRIVERS TO MAKE
SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS TIED
DOWN PROPERLY.
>> EVEN A BATHTUB LAST WEEK, DO
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
>> YEAH.
OKAY.
BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN TODAY.
WE WILL SHOW YOU WHAT IS COMING
UP TODAY.
I GOT TO CHANGE THE HEAT AND
HUMIDITY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK A LITTLE
BIT.
I THINK I HAVE SOME VIDEO.
WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

PRETTY SIMILAR.
IT WASN'T THAT MANY YEARS AGO OF
JACK RABBITS OUT THERE.
HOMES IN EVERY DIRECTION, LK
AT ALL OF THOSE CLOUDS OUT
THERE, THAT IS THAT SUBTROPICAL
STUFF COMING IN OUT OF MEXICO.
BRINGING WITH A CHANCE OF A FEW
SPRINKLES, MAYBE A THUNDERSTORM.
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE HEAVIER
THE CLOUD COVER, THE LESS CHANCE
THERE IS OF THUNDERSTORM
ACTIVITY.
WE HAVE HAD RAIN AND LIGHTNING
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, BUT WHEN
YOU SEE THE BREAKS IN THE
CLOUDS, THAT IS WHERE YOU GET A
CHANCE TO HEAT THINGS UP.
IT HEATS UP DRAICALLY AND
QUICKLY.
THAT IS WHEN YOU GET THE BEST
CHANCE.
BORREGO SPRINGS ALREADY AT 60
WHICH IS BACK TO 111 DEGREES.
THERE'S HUMIDITY AT 31%.
67 BY SCARE SON AT PACIFIC
BEACH.
RAINDROPS, THE COMPUTERAYS
YEAH BETTER CHANCE OVER THE
COUNTY.
A LOT OF RAIN OFFSHORE, DOWN IN
BAJA OFF TO THE EAST, A FEW
SPRINKLES OVERHEAD AND A BRIEF
COUPLE OF SHOWERS, BUT NOW THAT
IS GOING TO INCREASE A LITTLE
BIT.
THE HIGH PRESSURE YOU CAN SEE
THIS MOTION.
AS THIS THING DIPS DOWN THIS
WAY, A LITTLE BIT MOREHAN THIS
END OF IT.
SO A BETTER CHANCE BY THIS
AFTERNOON AND AGAIN TOMORROW OF
ALL OF THIS MOISTURE THAT IS OUT
OVER SAN DIEGO.

HIGH ANDHEN 94 OUT IN T
VALLEYS.
IT'S GOING TO FEEL WARMER

ALLERGIC CHILDREN AS WELL AS
DR. CHERRY WHO IS WITH THE
ALLIANCE IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT A
POLICY THAT YOU WANT TO
IMPLEMENT IN SAN DIEGO CITY
SCHOOLS.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FIRST OF ALL ANDREW WHAT IS THE
ALLIANCE ABOUT?
>> WE ARE ACTUALLY A GROUP OF
PARENTS THAT ARE FACING THE SAME
ISSUE WHICH IS WE HAVE CHILDREN
WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS AND
TREE NUTS.
WE HAVE COME TOGETHER TO TRY TO
GET THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ADOPT
POLICIES TO RECOGNIZE THIS
PROBLEM AND DEAL WITH IT.
>> WHICH MEANS THEY ARE ALLERGIC
TO NUTS.
SOMETIMES IN THE FOOD WE DON'T
KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN THEM,
RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WE ARE SHOWING PICTURES OF
PEOPLE GETTING EXAMINED.
AND ALSO TO PEANUT BUTTER AND
SOMETHING THAT THE DOCTOR IS
GOING TO SHOW US WHICH IS
TREATMENT FOR KIDS WHO ARE
ALLERGIC.
>> WHAT ARE THE SOME THE
SYMPTOMS?
WHAT DO CHILDREN FACE AS WELL AS
ADULTS WHEN THEY ARE ALLERGIC TO
PEANUTS AS WELL AS NUTS.
>> THEY WILL AN IMMEDIATE
REACTION AND THAT AN IMMEDIATE
SWELLING OF THE MOUTH, THE
TONGUE, THEIR VOCAL CHORDS WILL
COLLAPSE, AIR WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO GET INTO THEIR LUNGS AND
WITHIN MINUTES THEY COULD SIMPLY
DIE WITHOUT THE LIFE SAVING
MEDICINE.
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT YOUR
CHILD WAS ALLERGIC.
>> MY SON HAD A REACTION TO EGGS
WHEN HE WAS ONE YEAR OLD.
WE ENDED UP IN THE EMERGENCY
ROOM.
FROM THERE WE TESTED HIM FOR
OTHER FOODS.
>> BOTH OF YOU TODAY AND THIS

INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE GOING
TO BE SPEAKING BEFORE THE SCHOOL
BOARD BECAUSE YOU WANT A POLICY
IMPLEMENTED THAT REMOVES NUTS
FROM SCHOOLS AS WELL AS HAS
IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM FOR

RIGHT, MARIANNE.
WHAT WE ARE GOING IS THAT WE
REALIZE THAT AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL
PRINCIPALS AND NURSES ARE VERY
ACCOMMODATING AND WANT TO HELP
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY GUIDANCE
FROM ABOVE.
WE ARE ASKING THE DISTRICT TO
IMPLEMENT A COUPLE OF EASY
THINGS THAT LET THE PEOPLE AT
THE SCHOOL LEVEL TO KNOW HOW TO
DEAL WITH THESE.
JUST NOT ALLOW KIDS TO EAT NUTS
IN THE CLASSROOMS.
THEY CAN EAT THEM IN THE
CAFETERIA, JUST NOT IN THE
CLASSROOMS.

PUSH THE NEEDLE IN AND HOLD IT

IS RATHER LONG BUT IT'S LIFE
SAVING AND IT'S VERY QUICK.

DROP DOWN TO THE 80s.
IT WILL STILL FEEL VERY WARM
BECAUSE OF THE HUMIDITY AT LEAST
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE FZ OF DAYS.
PETCO PARK GAME.
>> KIMBERLY KING, ARE YOU GOING
TO THE GAME TONIGHT.
>> Reporter: I'M NOT GOING TO
THE GAME TONIGHT.
POSSIBLY THURSDAY, ANOTHER GAME.
>> Reporter: IF YOU ARE
TRAVELLING AROUND SAN DIEGO
COUNTY, IT'S SO NICE AND EASY
GOING.
163, THE 94, THE 5, IT ALL LOOKS
NICE THIS MORNING, NOT A LOT
GOING ON, NO MAJOR INCIDENTS TO
GET IN YOUR WAY TO WE WILL TAKE
IT.
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF SLOWING
AND I WILL GET TO THAT IN JUST A
SECOND OUT OF THE EAST COUNTY,
THE 94, THE 8, THE 52, THE 67,
THE 125, IT ALL LOOKS GREAT OUT
OF THE EAST COUNTY AND UP IN THE
SOUTH BAY.
HERE YOU SEE THE BRAKE LIGHTS.
OUT OF ESCONDIDO AND THAT STACKS
UP, OF COURSE, TYPICAL.
SOUTHBOUND SIDE OF INTERSTATE 5,
THE COASTLINE, THAT LOOKS GREAT,
THAT IS THE BEST BET OUT OF THE
COUNTY THIS MORNING.
BORDER WAYS HEAVY AT SAN YSIDRO
AND 35 TO 40 MINUTES AT OTAY
MESA.
IT'S A BUSY WEEK WE ARE HEADING
INTO AS WE HIT THE 4th OF
JULY, A WEEK OF TODAY.
THE DUI CHECK POINTS AND A LOT
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE OUT
IN FORCE.
>>> SPEAKING OF BEING BUSY OUT
IN THE ROADS.
EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE THINK OF
MEMORIAL DAYS AS THE QUICK OFF
SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON.
JUNE 21st MARKS THE OFFICIAL
START OF SUMMER.
THAT MEANS AMERICANS ARE TAKING
THEIR VACATION AND INVESTORS
WILL HAVE THEIR EYES ON THE
TRAVEL SECTOR.
CNBC REBECCA JARVIS TELLS US WHO
IS GOING TO COME OUT ON TOP THIS
SUMMER.
>> Reporter: THE TRAVEL
SEASON IS OFFICIALLY HERE AND A
NUMBER OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO
TAKE TO THE ROADS AND SKIES.
INDUSTRY FORECASTERS ANTICIPATE
AMERICANS WILL TAKE OVER
325 MILLION LEASURE TRIPS, ONE
PERCENT MORE THAN LAST YEAR.
LIKELY TO CASH IN, AIRLINES AND
HOTELS.
>> THE SUMMER SEASON ALWAYS
DRIVES, YOU KNOW THE PEAK PERIOD
FOR AIRLINE DEMAND.
THE PRICES SHOULD BE UP
MODESTLY.
THE AIRPLANES WILL BE FULL AS
EVER AND AIRLINE INVESTORS HAVE
A LOT TO REJOICE ABOUT.
>> Reporter: WHILE INVESTORS
REJOICE, THE CROWDING AND THE
WAITING, PERHAPS A SMALL PRICE
TO PAY IF THE ALTERNATIVE IS
$3 A GALLON GAS FOR THOSE WHO
TAKE THE ROAD.
ANALYSTS SAY THAT FIGURE
REPRESENTS A PSYCHOLOGICAL
TIPPING POINT FOR CONSUMERS.
26% OF PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO
CONSIDER CANCELING A TRIP WHEN
STARING DOWN THOSE PRICES AT THE
PUMP.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE
TRIP OF 800 MILES, THE INCREASED
GAS PRICES ARE PROBABLY 30 TO
$50 MORE.
SO IN A 4 OR FIVE-DAY TRIP,
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, MAYBE I WILL
HAVE ONE MORE FANCY MEAL OR ONE
MORE SOUVENIR.
THE OTHER THING WE ARE FINDING
IS PEOPLE ARE TRAVELLING
REGIONALLY.
>> Reporter: LIKE SIX FLAGS.
THE COMPANY SAYS 95% OF THE U.S.
POPULATION LIVES WITHIN AN EIGHT
HOUR DRIVE OF A SIX FLAGS THEME
PARK.

>> Reporter: REBECCA JARVIS,
CNBC BUSINESS NEWS.
>>> BIGGER TRAVEL DESTINATIONS
LIKE LAS VEGAS AND DISNEY ARE
ANTICIPATED HEALTHY SUMMER
DEMAND, DESPITE HIGH GRASS
PRICES.
ANALYSTS SAY IT WILL BE BECAUSE
OF TOURISTS WHO LIVE RELATIVELY
CLOSE BY.
ATTRACTIONS LIKE STATE PARKS AND
ACCESSIBLE VACATION TOWNS LIKE
THE ONE WE ARE IN NOW, SHOULD
BENEFIT FROM THE TREND.
>>> ONE IS THE LOWLIEST NUMBER
BUT IS IT THE MOST COMMON?
>> WHAT A NEW REPORT REVEALS

NOVELTY SEEKING IS A STRONG RISK
FACTOR FOR ALCOHOLISM FOR
CHILDREN OF ALCOHOL ALCOHOLICS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO
TAKE RISKS, ARE THRILL SEEKING
AND SOMETIMES ACT ON THEIR
IMPULSES.
RERESEARCHERS SAY SONS OF
ALCOHOLICS ARE PARTICULARLY
VULNERABLE.
>>> AMERICANS FINDING AND
KEEPING A GOOD CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
IS BECOMING A MORE MORE DIFFICULT.
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SAY
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYONE WHO THEY
DISCUSS IMPORTANT MATTERS WITH,
HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED.
INSTEAD CLOSE CONFIDENT ANTS ARE
S ARE
MORE LIKELY TO BE FAMILY
MEMBERS.
>>> RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT WOMEN
WITH CERTAIN GENETIC MUTATIONS
WHICH PREDISPOSED THEM TO BREAST
CANCER.
THEY FOUND MOST WOMEN WERE 54%
MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP BREAST
CANCER IF THEY HAD CHEST X-RAYS
COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD NEVER
DONE THE PROCEDURE.

MIGHT BE A SAFER ALTERNATIVE.

CLOUDS, SOME OF THOSE
SUBTROPICAL CLOUDS MOVING INTO
THE PICTURE.
NICE SHOT FROM MOUNT SAN MIGUEL.
WE HAVE FOG MOVING AROUND AS
WELL.
NOT THAT BAD, WE WOULD NOT
EXPECT IT WITH THIS WEATHER
PATTERN.
HUMIDITY HIGHER THAN WE WOULD
NORMALLY HAVE WITH THESE KINDS
OF TEMPERATURES.
WHEN IT'S THIS HOT, YOU THINK
SANTA ANA CONDITIONS, BUT SANTA
ANA IS DRY, BUT WHAT WE ARE NOT
USED TO IS HEAT WITH REGULAR
HUMIDITY.
THE HEAT IS CAUSING HEALTH
PROBLEMS AROUND THE COUNTY ARE
VERY TOUGH AND AIR-CONDITIONING
ING
YESTERDAY, CRANKED.
THE COUNTY USED ALMOST IN THE
RECORD TERRITORY.
69 DEGREES CURRENTLY, 85 IN
BORREGO SPRINGS.
69 AT THE COAST.
SO ALREADY HOT AND 35% DOESN'T
SEEM VERY HIGH FOR HUMIDITY, BUT
IF IT'S THAT HIGH AND IT HITS
110 THAT COULD BE UNREAL.
69 AT THE BEACH AND 94%.
WE ARE SEEING THAT THE COASTAL
AREAS COOL OFF A LITTLE BIT.
INLAND VALLEYS WILL START TO
MILD OUT I GUESS ONE WAY TO PUT
IT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK, IF WE COULD,
THERE'S THE DOPPLER.
LOOK AT ALL OF THE RAIN
OFFSHORE.
TONS OF IT, A BIG BAND OF RAIN
OUT THERE.
THE RAIN OFFSHORE IS MOVING THIS
WAY, EVER SO SLOWLY.
WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW AND WHY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
SATELLITE IF YOU COULD.
YOU WILL SEE THAT THE HIGH
PRESSURE AND EVERYTHING SPEAN
SPINNING AROUND IT IS AT THE
FOUR CORNERS.
THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO
SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST.
AS IT MOVES TO THE EAST AND TO
THE SOUTHEAST, ACTUALLY A LITTLE
BIT, THAT GREEN ADDS MOISTURE.
THAT IS GOING TO PULL THIS WAY.
ALL OF THOSE STORMS OFFSHORE ARE
THEN GOING TO BE MOVING RIGHT
OVERHEAD.
SO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE FZ DAYS,
THIS-- OFDAYS, THIS AFTERNOON AND
TOMORROW WE COULD SEE RAIN.
WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN A SHOWER OR
TWO OVER LAND AND A FEW
SPRINKLES, MAYBE YOU HAVE SEEN
THEM.
WE HAVE HAD THUNDER AND
LIGHTNING SINCE FRIDAY.
THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WHERE
YOU ARE IS TODAY AND TOMORROW.
WE ARE TOPPING OUT AT 80 DEGREES
DOWNTOWN THIS AFTERNOON.
MID-90s IN THE VALLEYS AND
LOOK AT 70s RIGHT STRAIGHT
THROUGH AT THE COAST.
A BIT MORE MILD THERE.
INLAND VALLEYS WE ARE DOPING
BACK INTO THE 80s, MORE THAN
LIKELY BY TOMORROW AND THAT IS
GOING TO FEEL STILL VERY WARM
BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL
HUMIDITY.
BUT AT LEAST WE ARE HEADED IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE,
WARM, SUNNY WEATHER FOR WEEKEND
BUT AT LEAST IT WON'T BE SO
TROPICAL IN NATURE.
GOOD NEWS ON THE WEATHER FRONT.
KIMBERLY KING, WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH TRAFFIC?
>> Reporter: IT GOT BUSY.
WE HAVE BEEN MORNING LIGHT BUT

THIS IS GETTING INTO HILLCREST

DECENT GETTING INTO DOWNTOWN
RIGHT NOW.
HEAVED THIS CRASH, THERE'S A
CRASH ON -- AHEAD OF THIS CRASH,
THERE'S A CRASH ON THE 1 SEE AND
8.
IT -- THE 1 SEE AND 163 AND THE 8.
YOU CAN SEE TRAFFIC STACKING UP
ON THE 5 AND 805.
GIVE YOURSELF EXTRA TIME.
NOT A BAD RIDE OUT OF THE EAST
COUNTY AS YOU CAN SEE UP AND
OVER THE SUMMIT OUT OF SANITY ON
THE 52 AND THE 8 OUT OF THE EAST
COUNTY AND ALSO THE 94 OUT OF
THE EAST COUNTY.

HE WAS ON THE THIRD STORY 
ALONE PRACTICING AN INITIATION 
SPEECH HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE

KNOWS WHY, THE SECOND BUILDING 
OF THIS BUILDING BEGAN TO 
COLLAPSE.
REMARKABLY, 50 PEOPLE WHO WERE

THEY WERE ABLE TO CRAWL INSIDE 
AND UNTANGLE THE MEN FROM THE 
TABLES AND CHAIRS THAT WERE 
HOLDING UP THE WALLS AROUND

CRAWLED UP THROUGH THE HOLE.

THE PRESS.
PRESIDENT BUSH AND HIS
ADMINISTRATION ARE SLAMMING THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" FOR REVEALING
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
SECRETLY MONITORING MILLIONS OF
FINANCIAL RECORDS AS PART OF THE
WAR ON TERROR.
NBC'S NORAH O'DONNEL IS IN
WASHINGTON WITH MORE THIS
MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING.
THIS ADMINISTRATION CALLED THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" ACTIONS
OUTRAGEOUS, IRRESPONSIBLE AND
HARMFUL.
TODAY ADDING POLITICAL PRESSURE
TO CALLS TO OPEN A JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION INTO
THE LEAK OF THE SECRET
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM.
>> Reporter: IT WAS A FULL COURT
PRESS.
THE PRESIDENT, VICE-PRESIDENT
AND PRESS SECRETARY TOGETHER
ANGRY DENOUNCING THE "NEW YORK
TIMES" FOR BREAKING THE STORY
THAT THE U.S. TRACKS
CONFIDENTIAL BANK RECORDS.
>> FOR A NEWSPAPER TO PUBLISH IT
DOES GREAT HARM TO THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
>> THE "NEW YORK TIMESE HASADE
IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO
PREVENT ATTACKS IN THE FUTURE.
>> Reporter: DEMOCRATS REBUKED
THE WHITE HOUSE'S ATTACKS
AGAINST THE MEDIA AS A
DIVERSIONARY TACTIC.
>> THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS
DECIDED IT'S A BETTER POLITICAL
STRATEGY TO SHOOT THE MESSENGER.
>> Reporter: THE "TIMES" SAYS
TERROR FINANCIERS KNOW THEIR
MONEY IS TRACKED AN ARGUMENT THE
ADMINISTRATION IS HAPPY TO
ENGAGE.
>> THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND
OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATION OUGHT TO
THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT
WHETHER A PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW
MIGHT OVERRIDE SOMEBODY'S RIGHT
TO LIVE.
>> Reporter: IT'S NOT THE FIRST
TIME THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK ON
THE PAPER WHICH DISCLOSED SECRET
WIRE TAPS.
>> WHAT IS DOUBLY DISTURBING FOR
ME NOT ONLY HAVE THEY GONE
FORWARD WITH STORIES BUT BEEN
REWARDED.
>> Reporter: ATTACKS IN THE
MIDST OF AN ELECTION YEAR MAY
RALLY THE CONSERVATIVE BASE.
>> IT'S A SAFE TARGET AND A
REMINDER SUPPORTERS THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS ON ONE SIDE AND THE
PRESS IS ON THE OTHER.
>> THIS COMES AS THE PRESIDENT'S
AGENDA IS STALLED IN CONGRESS
AND REPUBLICANS PACKED THE
SCHEDULE WITH ITEMS TO RALLY THE
BASE.
TODAY IT'S FLAG BURNING.
>>> CHRIS MATTHEWS IS THE HOST
OF "HARDBALL" ON MSNBC AND THE
CHRIS MATTHEWS SHOW.
THE ATTACK ON THE "NEW YORK
TIMES", YOU HEARD TONY SNOW.
HE SAID THAT NEWS OUTLETS SHOULD
THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT
WHETHER THE RIGHT TO KNOW IS
OVERRIDDEN BY AMERICAN'S RIGHT
TO LIVE.
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
>> WELL, I THINK AS A
JOURNALIST, THIS IS A TOUGH
CALL.
THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" SAID IT WAS A TOUGH
CALL TO JUDGE BETWEEN THE
PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW AND
CONGRESS'S RIGHT TO KNOW AND THE
DANGERS IT MIGHT PUT TO OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY.
THERE ARE MITIGATING FACTORS.
I SPENT THE WEEKEND READING
SUSKIND'S NEW BOOK.
WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME
THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
ARE CHECKING INTO TRANSFERS OF
MONEY AROUND THE WORLD.
IT'S WORKED.
WE PICKED UP A LOT USING THIS
FINANCIAL TRAIL.
EVERY TIME YOU PICK UP SOMEBODY
AS SUSKIND POINTS OUT IN HIS
BOOK, YOU IDENTIFY HOW YOU ARE
PICKING THEM UP.
THE ENEMY KNOWS WE ARE USING
FINANCIAL TRANSFERS TO CATCH
THEM.
THEY ARE USING INDEPENDENT
PEOPLE TO PHYSICALLY CARRY THE
MONEY AROUND.
YOU BEING ARGUE WHICH IS THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" ARGUMENT THAT A
GREAT DEAL OF THE SECRET HAS
BEEN OUT ALREADY.
>> THE OTHER QUESTION IS WHETHER
WE SHOULD TAKE THEIR WORD FOR IT
THAT THESE ARE LEGAL PROGRAMS
AND APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS.
DOES ANY ADMINISTRATION EARN THE
RIGHT IN THIS KIND OF WAR TO
PROTECT THAT KIND OF SECRET?
>> NOT THIS ONE.
I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CHARGE.
THE FACT IS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT
OF SECRECY IN THIS
ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS
UNWARRANTED BY ANY HISTORIC
MEASURE.
OUR ENERGY PROGRAM WE HAVE NEVER
KNOWN WHO WAS INVOLVED IN
PUTTING IT TOGETHER FROM THE
OUTSIDE.
AND ALSO WE JUST LEARNED FROM
THE "L.A. TIMES" SOMETHING WE
NEVER LEARNED FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION: 50,000 IRAQIs
WERE KILLED IN THIS WAR.
THE ADMINISTRATION NEVER GAVE US
ANY NUMBERS LIKE THAMENT WE HAVE
TO GO TO THE PRESS TO GET THE
INFORMATION.
WE HAVE A WAR THAT COST 50,000
LIVES.
WE CAN'T JUST COUNT ON THE
GOVERNMENT TO GIVE US THE
INFORMATION.
>> THE POLITICS OF IRAQ.
A NEW POLL OUT WITH THE POST-WAR
INDICATES THAT BUSH IS GAINING
GROUND BACK ON DEMOCRATS IN
TERMS OF HANDLING THE WAR.
THE PLAN BY GENERAL CASEY
TALKING ABOUT DRAWING DOWN
TROOPS BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
INSURGENTS ACCORDING TO THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" TALKING TO THE NEW
IRAQI GOVERNMENT.
INICATIONS OF BETTER NEWS ON THE
WAR.
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS THE
POLITICAL PROCESS OVER THERE IN
IRAQ IS WORKING LIKE IT WAS IN
NORTHERN IRELAND MANY YEARS AGO.
2 SIDES ARE STARTING TO TALK.
THAT'S FABULOUS NEWS BECAUSE IT
MEANS WE CAN COME HOME.
BUT AS LONG AS WE ARE IN THAT
WAR, IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE
PATTERN.
SINCE 9-11 OR SINCE WE WENT TO
WAR WITH IRAQ, THE PRESIDENT'S
NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN.
THERE HAS BEEN A TREND LINE
THROUGH ALL OF THE STATIC UP AND
DOWN.
THIS WEEK IT NOT UP AND NEXT
WEEK DOWN A BIT.
THE TREND LINE IS A 45 DEGREE
DROP SINCE 9-11.
THAT'S UNRELENTING FOR THE
PRESIDENT.
NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE NEWS IS
IN JUNE, BY NOVEMBER BASED ON
TRENDS THAT CONTINUED SINCE
9-11, THE PRESIDENT WILL BE IN
WORSE SHAPE WHEN THE VOTERS GO
TO THE POLLS IN NOVEMBER.
>> WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
HERE'S CAMPBELL.
>>> IT'S A SHOCKER FROM THE
AUTHOR OF THE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL
HARRY POTTER BOOKS, J.K.
ROWLING.
SHE SAYS THE BOY WIZARD COULD
MEET HIS END IN THE FINAL BOOK.
THE STORY FROM DAWNA FRIESEN.
>> Reporter: FOR FANS OF THE
WIZARD IN TRAINING LIFE WITHOUT
HARRY POTTER IS ALMOST
UNIMAGINABLE.
THE LAST BOOK SOLD 10 MILLION
COPIES ON THE DAY IT WAS
RELEASED AND THE MOVIE VERSIONS
HAVE BEEN BLOCKBUSTERS.
>> PEOPLE DIE.
>> Reporter: BUT ALL GOOD THINGS
MUST END AND YESTERDAY J.K.
ROWLING LET IT SLIP THAT IN THE
7th AND FINAL BOOK 2 OF THE
CHARACTERS WILL DIE.
ONE OF THEM COULD BE HARRY
POTTER HIMSELF.
>> I HAVE NEVER BEEN TEMPTED TO
KILL HIM OFF BEFORE BOOK 7.
THE FINAL CHAPTER IS HIDDEN
AWAY.
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOW CHANGED VERY
SLIGHTLY.
>> HAS IT?
>> YEAH.
ONE CHARACTER GOT A REPRIEVE.
>> OH.
>> 2 DIE.
>> Reporter: SHE WON'T REVEAL
WHO GETS KILLED.
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GET HATE
MAIL.
>> THE PRICE HAS TO BE PAID.
WE ARE DEALING WITH PURE EVIL
AND THEY DON'T TARGET THE
EXTRAS.
THEY GO FOR THE MAIN CHARACTERS.
>> Reporter: IF IT'S THE DEATH
NEL FOR HARRY POTTER THESE FANS
REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT.
>> NO.
>> WHY NOT?
>> BECAUSE HE HAS SUPER POWERS.
>> SHE SHOULD CHANGE HER PLOT.
>> Reporter: NOT LIKELY.
J.K. ROWLING SAYS SHE'S ALWAYS
KNOWN HOW THE LAST BOOK WOULD
END BECAUSE SHE WROTE THE FINAL
CHAPTER YEARS AGO.
>> I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER
HAVE ANYTHING LIKE HARRY AGAIN.
YOU JUST GET ONE.
>> NO WORD ON WHEN BOOK 7 WILL
COME OUT BUT J.K. ROWLING
ADMITTS SHE IS SAD TO SEE THE
SAGA END.

ARE WAKING UP SO EARLY TO SAY
HELLO TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS BACK
HOME.
IN OUR SUMMER STUDIO, OUR HOT
AND MUGGY AND WINDY SUMMER
STUDIO.
>> THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE.
>> I AM HAVING A BAD HAIR DAY.
WE HAVE HAD WIND GUSTS THAT ARE
AN ISSUE FOR ME AND ARE YOU.

I DON'T PAY ATTENTION.

VIOLIN.

DIFFERENT ENERGY.
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING -- WE

TRAVELING.
HE WATCHING ME INTENTLY.
>> I AM JUST LISTENING.
>> YOU CAN GET OFF THE PLANE AND
FEEL SICK.
THERE ARE QUESTIONWHETHER PEOPLE
TRAVELING WONDERING IF IT IS
MAKING THEM SICK?
IS THE AIR ON THE PLANE OR AL
GIVING YOU A HARD TIME SITTING
NEXT TO YOU.
WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT YOU NEED
TO KNOW TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY GERM FREE.
>> AND LATER, WOMEN AND HEART
DISEASE.
WOMEN DON'T SHOW THE CLASSIC
SIGNS THAT MEN DO WHEN THEY ARE
HAVING A HEART ATTACK.
A LOT OF TIMES IT GETS MISSED.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED
TO KNOW AND WHEN YOU NEED TO
KNOW IT AND GET TO THE HOSPITAL
RIGHT AWAY.
THE WARNING SIGNS CAN BE
DIFFERENT FOR WOMEN THAN MEN.
>>> FIRST MR. CHRIS HANSEN GOES
TO WASHINGTON.
"DATELINE"'S CHRIS HANSEN WILL
TESTIFY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS
ABOUT SEXUAL PREDATORS ONLINE.
HE SPENT 2 YEARS SHINING A
SPOTLIGHT ON THESE MEN.
CHRIS IS ON CAPITOL HILL WITH
THE LATEST.
>> THE FOCUS OF THE HEARING IS
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND
SOCIAL NETWORKING SIGHTS ARE
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP CHILDREN
SAFE ONLINE.
RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO
SAFETY MEASURES, THE INDUSTRY IS
SELF-REGULATED AND THE QUESTION
ON MANY LAWMAKERS'S MINDS: IS
THAT ENOUGH OR ARE NEW LAWS
REQUIRED?
SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WANTED
TO SEE THE RESULTS OF
"DATELINE"'S 5 INVESTIGATIONS IN
5 DIFFERENT STATES.
>> Reporter: I WILL BE SHOWING
CONGRESS THE KIND FOOTAGE
VIEWERS HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS
TIMES ON "DATELINE".
CAMERAS CAPTURING RESPECTED
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO
HAVE A SECRET: A CRIMINAL SECRET
INVOLVING THE POSSIBLE SEXUAL
EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN.
THEY THINK THEY ARE HEADED FOR A
MEETING WITH A 12, 13 OR
14-YEAR-OLD.
THEY THINK THE CHILD IS HOME
ALONE.
>> DID YOU BRING CONDOMS?
>> YEAH.
>> I WE ENLISTED THE HELP OF AN
ONLINE WATCH DOG GROUP CALLED
PERVERTED JUSTICE TO EXPOSE
POTENTIAL PREDATORS.
WE WILL REPORT TO THE CONGRESS
THE RESULTS OF A 2 YEAR
INVESTIGATION WITH 5 ON-CAMERA
STING OPERATIONS LEADING TO
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST 98
SUSPECTED PREDATORS.
MOST PLEADED NOT GUILTY AND
DENIED THEY WENT TO OUR HOUSE
FOR SEX.
>> SIR.
>> OH GOD.
>> WE WILL EMPHASIZE OTHER
SHOCKING REVELATIONS ABOUT WHAT
SOME OF THESE MEN DO FOR A
LIVING LIKE THIS 54-YEAR-OLD WHO
SAID HE WAS PROWLING FOR YOUNG
MEN IN A CHAT ROOM.
HE WALKED TO OUR HOUSE IN
VIRGINIA TO MEET A BOY HE
THOUGHT WAS 13 YEARS OLD.
>> HELLO.
>> HI.
>> HEY, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
I HAVE TO CHANGE MY SHIRT.
>> OKAY.
ARE YOU STILL GOING TO BE UP FOR
TONIGHT?
>> WE WILL SEE.
>> [LAUGHING]
>> Reporter: HOW I CAN HELP YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
>> NOT SOMETHING GOOD.
THIS ISN'T GOOD.
>> NOT GOOD?
THAT'S AN UNDER-STATEMENT, ISN'T
IT.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
>> I'M A RABBI.
>> Reporter: WE WILL SHOW
CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS THIS
43-YEAR-OLD MARRIED MAN FROM
CALIFORNIA WHO MADE A DATE WITH
A GIRL HE THOUGHT WAS 12.
>> I AM IN EDUCATION.
>> IN EDUCATION?
>> YEAH.
>> A TEACHER?
>> YES.
>> WHAT GRADE DO YOU TEACH?
>> HIGH SCHOOL.
>> Reporter: OUR EARLY
INVESTIGATIONS TOOK PLACE IN
MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS WHEN
LED US TO WONDER IF THIS ONLY
HAPPENINGS AROUND BIG CITIES OR
CAN IT HAPPEN EVERYWHERE?
THIS IS RURAL OHIO WHERE WE
HIRED A 19-YEAR-OLD ACTRESS WHO
LOOKS YOUNGER TO PLAY A
13-YEAR-OLD DECOY ON THE WEB
CAM.
WITHIN DAYS, THIS MAN SHOWS UP
TO MEET HER.
WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD
MEET?
>> THIS KID.
>> THIS KID?
>> SHE'S A KID.
>> HOW OLD?
>> 13.
>> 13 AND HOW OLD ARE YOU?
>> TOO OLD FOR A 13-YEAR-OLD.
>> TOO OLD.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
>> I AM A TEACHER.
>> WHAT GRADE?
>> 6th GRADE.
>> Reporter: RESEARCHERS TELL US
THESE MEN MAY BE DRIVEN BY MANY
FACTORS BUT A LOT OF THEM SHARE
AN ADDICTION FUELED BY THE
ACCESS THE INTERNET PROVIDES.
MEMBERS AT TODAY'S HEARING MAY
BE STUNNED AS WE WERE TO WATCH
THIS 40-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO WAS SO
BRAZEN, HE TOOK HIS YOUNG SON
ALONE AS HE SHOWDOWN UP TO MEET
A BOY HE THOUGHT WAS 14.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING
HERE?
>> NO.
>> Reporter: OR THIS MAN AFTER
TALKING TO ONE UNDERAGE DECOY
ONLINE AGREED TO STRIP OFF HIS
CLOTHES BEFORE INTERESTING THE
HOUSE -- ENTERING THE HOUSE.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> MAKING A MISTAKE.
>> Reporter: WHETHER IT'S A
MISTAKE OR CRIME IT'S ALARMINGLY
COMMON AND IT'S NOW CAUGHT THE
ATTENTION OF CONGRESS.
THE SUB-COMMITTEE WILL BE TAKING
TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND REPRESENTATIVES
FROM THE COMPANIES WHICH OWN
THESE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES
AND THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDE
CHRIS HANSEN ON CAPITOL HILL,

HIGH PRESSURE OUT OF THE

>>> WE ARE BACK.
IT USED THAT BE THAT PLANE
TRAVEL WAS EXCITING AND
SOMETHING YOU LOOKED FORWARD TO.
NOW MORE AND MORE PEOPLE JUST
WORRY ABOUT GETTING SICK.
GETING THAT SCRATCHY THROAT AT
THE END OF A LONG TRIP.
NBC'S MARTIN SAVIDGE HAS MORE.
>> Reporter: TODD IS GETTING
OVER ONE OF THE WORST COLDS HE
EVER HAD AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHERE HE CAUGHT IT: A FLIGHT ON
A BUSINESS TRIP.
>> AIR QUALITY IN PLANES IS
VERY, VERY POOR.
THAT'S ONE OF THE DRAGS OF
TRAVELING.
>> Reporter: IT'S NO VACATION
FOR THIS FAMILY.
GOING ON VACATION.
>> I THINK WE HAVE JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING.
>> Reporter: THEY ARE DRIVING
FROM NEW ORLEANS TO SOUTH
CAROLINA WITH A 19-MONTH-OLD.
IT'S 11 HOURS.
HE'S GOT BAD KNEES.
SHE'S 4 MONTHS PREGNANT AND.
>> I GET TERRIBLE MOTION
SICKNESS.
>> Reporter: WHETHER YOU ARE A
ROAD WARRIOR OR A BEACH BUM,
TRAVEL MAKES MANY SICK.
POOR DIET AND LACK OF SLEEP.
>> THE MOST COMMON ILLNESSES OF
TRAVELERS ARE COLDS AND SORE
THREATS AND SINUS INFECTIONS AND
INTESTINAL UPSETS.
>> Reporter: THESE DAYS
PASSENGERS PACK MORE THAN
CLOTHES.
ANTI-BACTERIAL WIPES AND PILLS.
AND THEN THERE'S THAT INVISIBLE
FELLOW PASSENGER.
STRESS.
>> AM A NERVOUS FLIER.
>> I ALWAYS HAVE A HEADACHE.
>> IT PUTS STRESS ON OUR
RELATIONSHIP.
>> Reporter: A WORLD BANK STUDY
OF INSURANCE CLAIMS SHOWS MEN
WENT TO THE DOCTOR MORE THAN 80
PERCENT MORE THAN NONTRAVELERS.
NO WONDER WHEN TODD GETS BACK
FROM THE ROAD HE IS BEAT.
>> SHE WANT ITS MAKE UP FOR LOST
TIME.
LET'S GO OUT.
I AM LIKE, I WANT TO STAY HOME.
[LAUGHING].
>> Reporter: SO THE NEXT TIME
YOU ARE TRAVELING AND THINK YOU
ARE HOMESICK, IT COULD BE YOU
ARE JUST SICK.
FOR "TODAY," MARTIN SAVIDGE, NBC
NEWS, ATLANTA.
>>> SO CAN TRAVEL REALLY MAKE
YOU SICK?
DR. MARK SIEGEL IS AN INTERNIST
AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF
MEDICINE.
GOOD MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> SO, CLEARLY A LOT OF PEOPLE
LOOKING AT THAT PIECE BELIEVE
THAT AIR TRAVEL ESPECIALLY IS A
WAY TO CONTRACT DISEASE.
IS THAT TRUE?
>> WELL, NOT EXACTLY.
ALTHOUGH REPORTS HAVE SHOWN THAT
20 PERCENT OF PEOPLE AFTER THEY
ARE ON A PLANE SAY THEY GET A
COLD OR A VIRUS.
THE PROBLEM WITH PLANE FLIGHT
SULOSE -- IS YOU LOSE CONTROL.
YOU ARE 35,000 FEET UP.
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL REACTION TO
BECOME MORE AFRAID THAT
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN.
WE GO IN WITH THAT IDEA IN MIND
AND THEN WE ARE PROBABLY MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE ON
PLANES.
>> BUT THERE ARE ALSO -- WE WERE
TALKING EARLIER -- ISSUES LIKE
GETTING DEHYDRATED AND HAVING
YOUR NASAL MEMBRANES DRY OUT?
>> RIGHT.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS, NOT
JUST THE PLANES.
IT'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT
RECYCLED AIR IS THE PROBLEM.
A RECENT STUDY OUT OF SAN
FRANCISCO SHOWS THAT THE AIR
DOESN'T INCREASE YOUR RISK OF
GETTING INVECTED.
YOU ARE CHANGING TIME ZONE OR
YOU ARE TIRED AND FATIGUED AND
MORE SUSCEPTIBLE.
YOU ARE RUN DOWN AND GET
DEHYDRATED.
MEMBRANES GET DRY.
YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET AN
INFECTION.
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM SUARE
CROWDED TOGETHER ON PLANES.
YOU MIGHT BE SITTING NEXT TO
SOMEBODY SNEEZING ON YOU AND
SURFACES GET VIRUSES.
WASHING YOUR HANDS IS KEY.
>> FOR CHILDREN, I GUESS THEY
ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE GIVEN THE
ENVIRONMENT.
>> CHILDREN ARE TOUCHING
EVERYTHING AND WIPING THEIR NOSE
AND HANDS ON OTHER PEOPLE AND
SPREAD INFECTION ON PLANES.
>> THE BIGGER CONCERNS.
THERE WERE 22 PEOPLE WHO
CONTRACTED SARS ON THE FLIGHT
FROM BEIJING IN 2003.
THERE WAS A SCARE WITH MUMPS
WHERE THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE
CONTROL WERE TRACKING AIR
PASSENGERS.
WHEN IT COMES TO SARS OR BIRD
FLU, IF PEOPLE BECOME CONCERNED
ABOUT THAT, ARE THE DANGERS
REALLY MORE FOR AIR TRAVELERS?
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
THESE ARE SERIOUS DISEASES.
THEY HAVE TO BE TRACKED
CAREFULLY.
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE TEND
TO PERSONALIZE RISK.
WE ARE ALL VOYURES.
AT THE HEIGHT OF SARS THE
CHANCES OF CONTRACTING IT WAS
VERY LOW.
THE SAME IS TRUE FROM BIRD FLU.
THE CHANCES OF GETTING IT
TRAVELING TO ASIA OR EATED A
COOKED CHICKEN THERE IS
PRACTICALLY ZERO.
>> YOU SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER
ABOUT THE RECYCLED AIR IN THE
PLANE.
BUT THERE ARE ALL OF THESE NEW
PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET TO -- OR
THEY ARE CLAIMING THEY CAN HELP
YOU.
I KNOW THIS SENDS OFF IONS THAT
ARE SUPPOSED TO CLEAR THE AIR.
DO THESE ACTUALLY WORK?
>> THIONS THEMSELVES ARE BEING
TESTED TO SEE IF THEY CAUSE A
PROBLEM.
THE MASKS WORK, BUT YOU HAVE TO
PUT THEM ON PROPERLY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU ARE
SITTING IN A SEAT AND SOMEBODY
NEXT TO YOU IS WEARING A MASK.
PEOPLE NEED TO RELAX WHEN THEY
TRAVEL ON PLANES.
STRESS IS THE KEY PROBLEM.
RELAX WHEN YOU FLY.
>> BOTTOM LINE.
WASH YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU WOULD
ANYWAY.
BASIC THINGS YOU WOULD DO
NORMALLY TO PREVENT GETTING A
COLD.
>> AND STRETCH YOUR LEGS.
THE CHANCES OF GETTING A BLOOD
CLOT IS LOW, BUT WE SAW IT
HAPPEN WITH DAVID BLOOM.
IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO
REMEMBER.
IT'S ONLY 40 IN A MILLION
PEOPLE.
STRETCH YOUR LEGS AND KEEPING
WELL HYDRATED AND WASHING YOUR
HANDS FREQUENTLY.
>> DOCTOR, APPRECIATE IT.
>>> COMING UP NEXT: SOMETHING
ELSE THAT CAN MAKE PEOPLE FEEL
SICK.
LOUD CELLPHONE USERS.

COMING UP AFTER THIS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

NOW THAT EVERYBODY AND THEIR
BROTHER HAS A CELLPHONE, YOU
WOULD I THINK THAT PHONE BOOTHS
WOULD GO THE WAY OF THE DINOSAUR
AND BECOME EXTINCT.
KEVIN TIBBLES FOUND THAT THE
PHONE BOOTH IS MAKING A COMEBACK
SORT OF.

>> Reporter: REMEMBER THE
INCONSIDERATE CELLPHONE MAN.
>> IT'S A PERFECT TIME!
>> Reporter: FOR MANY IT'S NOT
JUST A COMMERCIAL.
WITH OVER 203 MILLION USERS SOME
ARGUE WE HAVE BECOME AN
INCONSIDERATE CELLPHONE NATION.
IN A POLL 60 PERCENT SAID
CELLPHONE USE IN PUBLIC IS
IRRITATING.
NOW THAT'S AN IRRITATING RING.

IRRITATING GUY WITH CELLPHONES
IN A BAR, FOLLOW ME.
AT RESTAURANTS LIKE THIS ONE IN
CHICAGO, YOU CAN SLIP AWAY FROM
THE CROWD INTO THE PRIVACY OF
YOUR OWN CELLPHONE BOOTH.
YES, THE WEATHER IS FINE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE.
WELL, THE IDEA FIRST BEGAN IN
2002 AT LOWES MOVIE THEATERS
WHICH OFFERED COURTESY ZONES.
CELLPHONE BOOTHS ARE A GROWING
TREND.
THEY MAY LOOK SIMILAR TO THE
CLASSIC PHONE BOOTHS MADE FAME
US BY YOU KNOW WHO IS SHOWN
FURTHER FILMS LIKE PHONE BOOTH.
BUT THESE HIGH-TECH BOOTHS CELL
ARE UP TO $40,000 EACH ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.
>> IT'S THE RESTAURANT AND NIGHT
CLUB INDUSTRY.
>> Reporter: WILL PEOPLE USE
THEM?
>> THEY SEE IT AND THE TENDENCE
SETO GO AND USE IT.
>> Reporter: ARE THESE BOOTHS
THE ANSWER TO INCONSIDERATE
CELLPHONE PEOPLE?
>> IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE A
SOUND PROOF ROOM FOR CELLPHONE
USE ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC SPACES.
IN REALITY, I THINK WE WILL END
UP THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WAITING
IN LINE WAITING TO USE THE
BOOTH.
>> FOR "TODAY," KEVIN TIBBLES,
NBC NEWS, CHICAGO.
>> I AM GETTING A CALL HERE.
>> YOU ARE SO RUDE SHOULD GO IN
MY CELLPHONE BOOTH.
>> GOODBYE.
>> THIS IS FABULOUS.
>> I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF HIM.

MOISTURE OVER LAND.
SO WHO KNOWS, WE COULD ALL SEE
SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON, AND
MAYBE A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO IN

KEEP ALL OF THAT IN MIND AND HOT
AND MUGGY.
AND THAT'S LATEST WEATHER.
AND NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE 
RAIN AND THINK ABOUT THE 
SUNSHINE.
HERE TO HELP US, MARTHA 
STEWART.
SHE'S COMING UP AND, HAS GREAT 
IDEAS FOR GREAT COOL DRINKS 
FOR THE OCCASION.
COMING UP NEXT, IMPORTANT 
HEALTH INFORMATION, IT'S ABOUT 
WOMEN AND THE THREAT OF HEART 
DISEASE.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU NEED 
TO KNOW RIGHT AFTER THIS. 
>> AND WE'RE BACK AT 8:11, 
THIS MORNINGA TAKE CHARGE, 
WOMEN AND HEART DISEASE, EACH 
YEAR, 250,000 WOMEN DIE OF A 
HEART ATTACK AND 2-THIRDS OF 
THEM NEVER MAKE IT TO THE 
HOSPITAL.
IN A LOT OF CASES IT'S PROOF 
THAT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW CAN 
KILL YOU.
>> EMERGENCY .
>> IN THE MOVIES, IT'S USUALLY 
A MAN WHO IS STRICKEN WITH A 
SUDDEN GUT-WRENCHING HEART 
ATTACK U. DON'T SEE WOMEN WITH 
CLASSIC HEART ATTACK SYMPTOMS 
BECAUSE THEIR WARNING SIGNS 
ARE DIFFERENT.
DR. GOLDBERG
WROTE A BOOK
CALLED "WOMEN ARE NOT SMALL MEN"
NOW REPRINTED AS THE WOMEN'S
HEALTHY HEART PROGRAM.
>> TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE THAT
WOMEN'S PHYSICIANOLOGY, HER
SYMPTOMS ARE GOING TO BE
DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF A MAN.
>> MOST MEN FEEL THAT CRUSHING
PAIN IN THE CHEST, WHILE WOMEN
CAN FEEL FATIGUE, INDIGESTION OR
HAVE DIFFICULTY BREATHING.
MEN DEVELOP BUMPY PLAQUE INSIDE
THEIR ARTERIES, WHILE WOMEN GET
PLAQUE THAT IS MORE EVENLY
DISTRIBUTED.
THAT IS WHY THEIR SYMPTOMS MAY
BE MORE SULTLE.
15 YEARS AGO ROSE JACKMAN WAS A
SMOKER.
>> I WOULD FEEL A CERTAIN
PANTING, IN TERMS OF MY
BREATHING WAS LABORED AT THE
TIME.
>> ROSE HAD A STRESS TEST, WHICH
SHOWED NO SIGNS OF HEART
TROUBLE, BUT DR. GOLDBERG
INSISTED ON AN ANGIOGRAM.
>> THEY DISCOVERED THAT I HAD A
99% BLOCK IN MY LEFT MAIN.
AND THEY PROCEEDED TO DO AN
EMERGENCY ANGIOPLASTY.
>> ROSE WAS THANKLE FOR HER
DOCTOR'S PERSISTENCE.
A HEART ATTACK WAS AVERTED AND
IT CHANGED HER LIFE.
>> THE CHANGE OF LIFESTYLE MEANT
THAT I WAS EXERCISING ON A
REGULAR BASIS.
AND IT MEANT THAT I WAS NOT
EATING FOODS THAT WERE HIGH IN
FAT.
AND I WAS WATCHING WHAT I ATE.
AND CERTAINLY I STOPPED SMOKING.
>> STEPHANIE WAS 34 WHEN SHE HAD
A HEART ATTACK, WHILE STUDYING
IN SPAIN.
>> IT WAS A CRUSHING PAIN IN MY
CHEST.
SOME PEOPLE SAY LIKE AN ELEPHANT
STEPING ON YOUR CHEST.
>> STEPHANIE WAS RUSHED TO THE
HOSPITAL, AND WAS SUCCESSFULLY
TREATED.
FOUR YEARS LATER IN NEW YORK,
SHE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR SYMPTOMS
AND CALLED 911.
AGAIN SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL,
BUT EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS SENT
HER HOME.
>> IN MY CASE I HAD THE VERY
CLASSIC MALE SYMPTOMS, AND IT
STILL WENT UNDIAGNOSED.
SO THERE WAS REALLY NO REASON
FOR ME TO BE SENT HOME THAT DAY.
>> THREE DAYS LATER, STEPHANIE
WENT TO SEE DR. GOLDBERG WHO
INSISTED SHE GET AN ANGIOGRAM.
IT SHOWED A THE 0% BLOCKAGE IN
HER ARTERY.
STEPHANIE SAYS EVEN WITH CLASSIC
SYMPTOMS, SOME DOCTORS NEED TO
PAY MORE ATTENTION.
>> IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME FOR
DOCTORS TO CATCH UP AND
UNDERSTAND THAT WOMEN ARE AS
LIKELY TO BE CANDIDATES FOR
HEART DISEASE AS MEN ARE.
>> DR. 
DR. LORI MOSCA, GOOD MORNING TO
YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
STATISTIC EARLIER, WHICH I THINK
IS AMAZING, BASED ON YOUR
RESEARCH, THAT ONLY 20% OF
DOCTORS KNOW THAT HEART DISEASE
KILLS MORE WOMEN THAN MEN.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> WELL, SCAMP BELL WE WERE SO
SURPRISED AND REALLY A BIT
MISTFIED AS TO THE FACT THAT
MORE DOCTORS WEREN'T AWARE OF
THIS IMPORTANT GENDER
DIFFERENCE, WHICH UNDERSCORES
WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT
WOMEN TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR OWN
HEART HEATH.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE
AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION, OVER
THE PAST TEN YEARS, HAS
CONDUCTED A SERIES OF SURVEYS,
AND SHOWED THAT WE'VE DOUBLED
THE RATE OF AWARENESS AMONG
WOMEN.
SO WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS, BUT WE
HAVE A WAYS TO GO.
>> WE ALSO IN SAW IN THE PIECE,
THAT STRESS TESTS FOR WOMEN
DON'T ALWAYS PICK UP HEART
DISEASE.
WHY IS THAT?
>> WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT THAN MEN.
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
REASONS WHY IT IS MORE DIFFICULT
TO INTERPRET IT IN WOMEN
COMPARED TO MEN.
THEY HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY
GETTING THEIR HEART RATE UP
WHILE ON THE TREADMILL TEST.
THEY HAVE ESTROGEN LEVELS WHICH
EFFECT THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY
OF THE HEART.
WOMEN HAVE MORE SUBTLE DISEASE.
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE BIG
BLOCKAGE, AND THIS MAKE IT'S
MORE DIFFICULT TO PICK UP.
>> AND MORE SUBTLE SYMPTOMS WHEN
IT COMES TO HEART ATTACK.
SYMPTOMS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN
MEN.
TAKE US THROUGH THOSE.
>> THAT IS RIGHT.
WE SAW A PICTURE OF THE CLASSIC
HOLLYWOOD HEART ATTACK.
YOU KNOW, THE CHEST PAIN.
THERE IS A LOT OF MISPERCEPTIONS
ABOUT THAT, CAMPBELL.
IN FACT, CHEST PAIN IS STILL THE
MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN BOTH MEN
AND WOMEN.
BUT WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO
HAVE THESE UNUSUAL SYMPTOMS.
SUCH AS DIFFICULTY BREATHING.
NAWDZIA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, JAW
PAIN.
>> IT CAN ALMOST JUST FEEL LIKE
INDIGESTION.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> SO IT'S EASY TO IGNORE,
RIGHT?
>> IT IS, AND THAT IS THE
PROBLEM.
BECAUSE WOMEN DO TEND TO IGNORE
THE SYMPTOMS, IT IS NOT ON THEIR
RADAR SCREEN THAT IT MIGHT BE
HEART DISEASE.
SO THEY DELAY.
THEY DON'T SEEK TREATMENT.
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SHOW UP, THEY
HAVE A WORSE PROGNOSIS, AND MORE
COMPLICATIONS.
>> WHAT ABOUT RISK FACTORS?
BECAUSE THEY HAVE RISK FACTORS
THAT ARE DIFFERENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
RISK FACTORS IN MEN AND WOMEN
ARE SIMILAR.
BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MORE RISKE
IN WOMEN.
DIE BEATIES, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A
STRONG RISK FACTOR IN WOMEN.
LOW LEVELS OF THE GOOD
CHOLESTEROL ARE MORE STRONGER
RISK FACTOR IN WOMEN COMPARED TO
MEN.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS,?
WOMEN RESPOND EQUALLY AS WELL TO
MEN, IN TERMS OF PREVENTIVE
THERAPY AND RISK FACTOR CONTROL.
>> WELL, THEY ARE, THOUGH, ALSO
LIKELY TO HAVE MORE
COMPLICATIONS FROM HEART
DISEASE?
WHAT CAN WE DO TO PROTECT
OURSELVES IN THAT REGARD?
>> THAT IS THE KEY.
>> PREVENTION, GETING IT ON THE
RADAR SCREEN, BEING AWARE THAT
HEART DISEASE IS A THREAT FOR
WOMEN.
DON'T IGNORE THOSE SYMPTOMS.
DON'T DELAY.
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, GET AN
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT YOUR RISK
FACTOR STATUS IS.
>> AND REAL QUICK, WE'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME.
BUT LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT NEWS
RECRENLY.
WOMEN SHOULD NOT TAKE ASPIRIN TO
PREVENT HEART ATTACKS.
>> ANOTHER FASCINATING GENDER
DIFFERENCE.
ASPIRIN PREVENTS SECOND HEART
ATTACKS IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN.
BUT FIRST HEART ATTACKS, ASPIRIN
WORKS IN MEN, BUT NOT WOMEN.
SO IT UNDERSCORES THE POINT THAT
WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE GOOSE,
ISN'T ALWAYS GOOD FOR THE
GANDER.
>> IT IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION,
AND IT IS AMAZING HOW LITTLE WE
KNOW OR SEEM TO KNOW ABOUT
OURSELVES.
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE FOCUS HAS
BEEN ON MEN AND HEART ATTACKS.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
BUT WE KNOW NOW THAT KNOWLEDGE
IS POWER TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH.
>> DR. LORI MOSCO, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
>> IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT
WOMEN AND HEART DISEASE, YOU CAN

AT TODAY.MSNBC.COM.

OF YOUR QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE ON

I'M NOT IN REMISSION, BUT I IT
WAS SIX MONTHS AGO.
>> FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST
CANCER WHEN SHE WAS 26, SHE HAD
SURGERY.
TEN YEARS LATER, THE CANCER CAME
BACK T HAD SPREAD TO HER LUNGS
AND BONES.
DOCTORS GAVE HER SIX MONTHS TO
LIVE.
SIX YEARS LATER, AND SHE'S NOT
ONLY STILL HERE, SHE'S GETTING
READY TO RIDE ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES, 4200 MILES.
>> SINCE BEING DIAGNOSED, JANE
HAS COVERED ABOUT 4,000 MILES IN
VARIOUS EVENTS, RAISING ALMOST
$2 MILLION FOR CHARITY, AND
BECOMING AN INSPIRATION FOR
CANCER SUFFERERERS EVERYWHERE.
>> IT CAN LIVE A LIFE AND BE
FULFILLED JUST BY, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER NEWS YOU HAVE TO LIVE
WITH.

SHE'S MORE ALIVE THAN MOST OF

GIVE YOU A HARD TIME IF YOU
TRIED TO RAISE MONEY DOING
SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS
GRUELING.
>> NO, WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
THAT WAS EXCITING AS WELL.
>> UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS NOT JUST GRUELING, NS A
TRIP LIKE BEYOND ANYTHING YOU'VE
EVER DONE BEFORE, JUST TO GIVE
PEOPLE A SENSE.
THE LONGEST TRIP YOU'VE EVER
DONE IS 4200 MILES, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
>> ALSO THE HOTTEST, BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE DESERT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER.
SO AT POINTS THE TEMPERATURES
GOING TO BE OVER 100.

CHALLENGE.
AND IT IS A CHALLENGE.
>> WE WANTED IT TO BE EXCITING.
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
IT.
RYAN'S CYCLING WITH ME.
IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE
ADVENTURE, AND MOPEFULLY BECAUSE
IT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE.
>> $2 MILLION IS WHAT YOU'RE
AIMING FOR, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR
U.S. CHARITY, AND U.K. CHARITIES

ANNIVERSARY OF WHEN DOCTORS TOLD
YOU THAT YOU HAD TERMINAL
CANCER.
>> YEAH, AND I'VE BEEN REALLY
ILL THIS YEAR.
I FINISHED CHEMOTHERAPY EIGHT
WEEKS AGO.
AND REALLY AS BIG A CHALLENGE AS
THIS IS, IT IT'S BEEN A HUGE
CHALLENGE TO GET WELL ENOUGH TO
BE EVEN GETTING OUT HERE TO THE
STATES TO START THIS RIDE.
>> THAT IS WHAT I'M SO CURIOUS
ABOUT.
DO YOU FEEL PHYSICAL THREE UP TO
IT?
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT AT CERTAIN
POINTS IN THE TRIP, YOUR BODY'S
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HANG IN
THERE?
>> I THINK THERE ARE AREAS WHERE
YOU THINK YEAH, MAYBE MY ED
ABOUTY WILL SAY NUCH'S ENOUGH.
BUT UNLESS I GIVE IT A GO.
I WON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE TO
ACHIEVE THIS OR NOT.
IT WOULD BE EASY TO SIT HOME AND
SAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF
I COULD TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY.
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF I'D BE WELL
ENOUGH.
BUT TO COME OUT HERE, AND
ACTUALLY START
IT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU KNOW IF
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FIT ENOUGH
FOR IT.
>> AND RYAN'S GOING ALONG WITH
YOU, AND YOUR HUSBAND ACE TAKING
AN RV ALONG AS WELL?
SO THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL BE
SLEEPING ALONG THE WAY?
>> YEAH, AND I'M DELIGHTED THAT
MY HUSBAND AND FAMILY WILL BE
OUT FOR THE WHOLE OF THE TRIP.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO BE AROUND
FOR MY SON'S LIFE LATER, AND I
WANTED HIM TO HAVE REALLY GOOD
MEMORIES TO HOLD ON TO.
>> THESE ARE MEMORIES, YEAH.
>> WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU, AND
RYAN, TOO YOU AS WELL.
YOU MAY BE TRYING TO KEEP UP
WITH HER.
>> WE HOPE.

NAUTICAL FASHION KEEPS STAYING
AFLOAT.

PART OF AMERICAN CULTURE FOR SO
LONG, THAT DESIGNERS LOVE TO BE
INFLUENCED BY IT.
WHETHER IT IS A FANCY RACING
SHIP LIKE THIS.
OR THE MORE WORKING KIND OF LONG
SHOREMEN LOOK.
AND REMEMBER, IT IS NOT A COTION
TOMB.
SO IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE LIKE WHY

THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE
OVER.

LIFE.

THEY'RE S & J.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE
IT, THERE IS A ROPE DETAIL.
SO IT IS A CANVAS DECK SHOE.

BETWEEN GOING OVERBOARD, IF YOU
WILL?

PEG LEG, YOU'LL BE FINE.

SOPHISTICATED AND READY FOR

>> THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS
THAT WOMEN TEND TO BE MORE
EMOTIONAL THAN MEN.
AND OFTEN THOSE OUTBURSTS CAN BE
CONSTRUED AS CRANKINESS.
BUT IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE MEN
ARE ARE BEING TAGGED WITH NAMES
LIKE GRUMPY, GROUCHY, CRANKY.
UNTIL THE GUY BLOWS OFF SOME OF
THE STEAM, WATCH OUT.
>> HEY, COME HERE.
>> YEAH?
>> WHAT IS THIS?
>> MY FAMILY DOESN'T LIKE ME
WHEN I'M HUNGRY.
I'M PRETTY GRUMPY WHEN I'M
HUNGRY.
>> I BELIEVE THAT THE MEN ARE
MORE GRUMPY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
MORE FUSSY ABOUT HAVING
EVERYTHING JUST RIGHT.
>> GRUMPY GUYS THEY'VE BEEN WITH
US FOR GENERATIONS.
>> THE METS ARE IN THE SEVENTH
GAME OF THE WORLD SEERD, AND YOU
KNOW, THIS AND YOU WANT ME TO
THINK ABOUT PLUMBING?
>> OKAY, SO IT MAKES A LITTLE
NOISE, BUT SO DO YOU, AND I'VE
LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THAT.
>> SEEMS LIKE IF THE CABLE'S
OUT, THEY CAN BE GRUMPY.
OR IF DINNER WASN'T COOKED
RIGHT, THEY CAN BE GRUMPY.
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT THINGS THAN
WOMEN.
>> SO WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GET
OLDER?
WHY ARE LITTLE OLD LADIES
CONSIDERED SWEET, WHILE OLD MEN
ARE CALLED CRANKY.
>> I THINK MEN GET GRUMPIER AS
THEY GET OLDR AND FATTER.
>> FOR MOST MEN, THE SOLUTION IS
SIMPLE.
>> GIVE HIM A NICE, COLD, COORS,
AND FIX HIM A MEAL.
LET HIM VENT.
>> AND WHO SAYS BEING GRUMPY IS
SUCH A BAD THING?
WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT
COLLEGERS LIKE ARCHY BUNKER, AND
ANDY ROONEY.
AS LONG AS SOMEONE IS PATIENT
ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO THEM.
>> IT'S OUR JOB TO SOOTH THEM,
KEEP THEM HAPPY.
COOL THEM DOWN.
>> SO ARE GRUMPY MEN, A GROWING
TREND?
ROBI LUDWIG IS A PSYCHO
THERAPIST, AND DENNIS NEIL IS
THE MAN ANGEING EDITOR AT FORBES
MAGAZINE.
>> DENNIS, WHAT IS THE DEAL
HERE?
IS THIS A STEREOTYPE OR IS THERE
SOMETHING GOING ON?
>> OH, NO, THE REASON
STEREOTYPES ARE STEREOTYPES IS
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO OFTEN VERY
TRUE.
I HATE THAT YOU WANT TO LOOK TO
ME AS AN EXPERT ON GRUMPY MEN,
BUT IT CERTAINLY MUST MEAN I AM
ONE.
ONE REASON, WE CAN MAKE UP ALL
KINDS OF REASONS.
BUT ONE REASON IS WE DON'T KNOW
OUR PLACE ANYMORE AS MEN.
WE'VE BEEN RUN PAST BY WOMEN.
DO YOU WANT US TO PAY OR NOT
PAY.
I CAN ORDER FOR YOU AT THE
RESTAURANT OR DOES THAT OPRESS,
YOU AND THAT LEADS TO
INSECURITY, AND THE INSECURITY
MAKES US MIFFED.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO WE NOT KNOW OUR PLACE
ANYMORE?
POOR US, ESSENTIALLY.
WE CAN'T FIND OUR GROOVE ANY
LONGER.
>> I THINK THAT'S TRUE.
AND MEN ARE UNDER ENORMOUS
PRESSURE, FINANCIALLY AND WITH
CHILDREN.
THEY'RE NOT REALLY USED TO
TALKING ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONS.
SO IF YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
IT, AND NOT DEALING WITH THE
INTENSITY OF WHAT AM I DOING
WITH MY LIFE T. CAN MAKE YOU
CRANKY AND DEPRESSED.
>> BUT BECAUSE THE RULES ARE NOT
AS WELL DEFINED AS THEY USED TO
BE.
SHOULDN'T MEN BE ABLE TO ADJUST,
DENNIS?
>> I THINK THAT THE WHOLE STORY
IS AN OXYMORON, BECAUSE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT MEN AND THEIR
FEELINGS.
AND USUALLY WE JUST PICK UP THE
REMOTE CONTROL AND DO AWAY WITH
THE FEELING PART.
SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE BOTTLED
UP FEELS SOMETIME IT'S TURNS
INTO GRUMPINESS AND AVERAGER.
BUT LET'S FACE IT, OKAY?
THE OLDER YOU GET, THE GRUMPIER
YOU GET, YOU'RE GETTING GRUMPY
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING OLD.
>> ROBI, A LOT OF THIS IS WHAT
CAN WOMEN DO?
THEIR HUSBAND'S AT HOME, HE
CAN'T HEAR, BUT OWE WON'T GET A
HEARING AID.
HE DOESN'T FEEL WELL, BUT HE
WON'T GO TO THE DOCTOR.
>> DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
DON'T ASSUME IT HAS TO DO WITH
YOU.
ASSUME THAT YOURLOUS OR SPOUSE
OR PARTNER HAS SOME INNER
CONFLICT GOING ON.
AND TRYING TO EXPLORE IT IN A
NONJUDGMENTAL WAY.
AND SOMETIMES MEN FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT
FACE-TO-FACE INTERACTION.
TAKE THEM FOR A WALK.
FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT.
REALLY EXPLORE IT WITH THEM,
HELP THEM TO TELL YOU.
IN A WAY, IT IS A COMPLIMENT.
BECAUSE IF A MAN IS BEING GRUMPY
IN YOUR PRESENCE, IT MEANS HE
FEELS COMFORTABLE TO BE HIMSELF.
>> SOMETIMES THAT COMFORT IS A
LITTLE TOO COMFORTABLE.
>> TO A POINT.
>> WHAT ABOUT SEX, DENNIS?
THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE, TOO.
>>
>> WELL, I LIKED ROBI'S ANSWER,
IT WAS OFFERING ADVICE TO WOMEN.
BUT A GUY'S ADVICE TO THOSE SAME
WOMEN WOULD BE JUST GIVE YOUR
HUSBAND MORE AFFECTION.
I MEAN LIKE AFFECTION,
AFFECTION.
BECAUSE, AND I KNOW THAT OOUR
MAD AT US FOR NOT TAKING OUT THE
GARBAGE, AND NOT DOING

HOUSEWORK.
BUT GIVE US A CHART.

.
.
BLAH, BLAH
GAME.
>> THIS IS LIKE DEAL
WAG

4-YEAR-OLD HERE.
LIKE GETTING A STICKER AT THE
END OF THE DAY.
>> BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO KNOW
YOUR MAN AND STUDY WHAT WORKS
FOR HIM.
THERE IS A PLACE FOR GOOD SEX.
AND BE NURTURING.
WHAT WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER
FROM HIS EXPERIENCE AND AND TRY
TO OFFER I HIM THAT?
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT OTHER HINTS.
SPECIFICALLY FOR WOMEN.
YOU HAVE A FEW.
THE FIRST ONE IS DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.
>> DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY,
DON'T ASSUME IT HAS TO DO WITH
YOU.
REALLY HELP YOUR SPOUSE,
PARTNER, SIGNIFICANT OTHER TALK
ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE.
ASK WHAT'S GOING ON IN HIS WORLD
SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF WHAT
IS GOING ON.
MEN CAN'T SAY I'M HAVING A BAD
TESTOSTERONE DAY, SO DEAL WITH
IT.
>> THE LAST ONE I LIKE IS ENOUGH
IS ENOUGH.
AT SOME POINT YOU'VE GOT TO.
>> YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
RULE OUT MEDICAL PROBLEMS, AND
MOOD DIFFICULTIES.
AFTER A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS,
YOU NEED TO SAY, YOU'RE NOT
DOING WELL, THIS IS NOT WORKING,
WE NEED TO EXPLORE WHAT WE CAN
DO TOGETHER.
>> IT WAS G. BUT THAT WHOLE
LITANY LEFT OUT THAT ONE THING,
AND HAVE MORE SEX WITH YOUR
HUSBAND.
THAT IS IT.
YOU NEED TO SPEAK UP FOR
HUSBAND'S EVERYWHERE, THOUGH I'M
NOT ONE.
>> SOUNDS GOOD.
>> HAVE MORE SEX.
>> OKAY, I THINK WE'LL END
THERE.

>> BRITISH ROYAL SPOKES WOMAN,
HUMANITARIAN, AUTHOR AND MOM ARE
A FEW OF THE WORDS YOU CAN USE
TO DESCRIBE SARAH MERG FERGUSSON, THE
DUCHESS OF YORK.
THIS MORNING SHE JOIN IS US TO
TALK ABOUT HER NEW CHILDREN'S
BOOK "LITTLE RED'S ADVENTURE."
I LIKE SET OUTSIDE.
BEGUN FOR THE HAIR.
>> I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
MYSELF.
SO THIS IS YOUR THIRD LITTLE RED
BOOK.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT LITTLE RED THAT
KEEPS YOU COMING BACK TO HER?
>> I JUST THINK SHE FACES HER
FEARS, AND WHEN HER PARENTS ARE
READING LITTLE RED TO THEIR
CHILCHEN, THEYAN REALLY
ADNRESS THOSE ISSUES OF, YOU
KNOW, GOOD PARENTING, WHICH IS
FACE YOUR FEARS, AND MAYBE IT'S
NOT GOING TO BE SO FRIGHTENING
AFTER THAT.
AND IT'S ABOUT REALLY
ENCOURAGING EDUCATION THROUGH
BOOKS, RATHER THAN JUST
TELEVISION ALL TIME.
>> AND THIS ADVENTURE OF LITTLE
RED'S, ACTUALLY HAS A TIE IN TO
9/11.
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
>> WELL, EXACTLY, BECAUSE LITTLE
RED WAS DESIGNED TO HELP GIVE
BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
REALLY.
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.
THEY'VE GIVEN ME BACK MY LIFE.
AND MY CHILDREN HAVE A BETTER
MOTHER BECAUSE OF THEM,
CONFIDENCE, SELF ESTEEM ISSUES,
AND TOTAL WELLNESS WITHIN
MYSELF.
THE ONLY WAY TO THANK THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, YOU, IS TO
START A FOUNDATION CALLED
CHANCES FOR CHILDREN.
AND LITTLE RED IS THE LOGO.
AND SHE WAS BORN IN OKLAHOMA
CITY FOR P.J.
AND HE SURVIVED THE TERRIBLE
BOMBING.
AND HE WAS CARRIED OUT BY A
FIREMAN, AND I WENT TO OKLAHOMA,
FOUND P.J., REALIZED HE NEEDED
HELP.
THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO.
AND ALL OF THE MONEY FROM LITTLE
RED GOES TO THE CHARITY FROM THE
DOLL.
>> WHAT IS IN THIS BOX?
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS MY
OFFICE WAS ON SEPTEMBER 11th
WAS ON THE 101st FLOOR.
AND LITTLE RED WAS SITTING IN
THE WINDOW, AND SHE LOOKED DOWN
ON MANHATTAN, AND IN THE
DEVASTATION, THEY FOUND HER IN
THE RUBBLE.
SO TODAY, I ACTUALLY MANAGED TO
BRINGS LITTLE RED, THE ACTUAL
DOLL THAT SURVIVED.
>> THIS WAS IN THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER?
>> YES, AND SHE ACTUALLY
SURVIVED.
THIS IS THE ACTUAL DOLL.
SHE CAME, SHE WAS FOUND IN THE
RUBBLE.
THERE SHE IS, LOOK, THERE.
AND SHE WAS FOUND LIKE THAT, AND
THIS IS THE ACTUAL DOLL.
AND I THINK THAT IN THE
CHILDREN'S BOOKS, IT'S ABOUT
SURVIVAL, AND GETTING OTHER.
AND THESE BOOKS ARE ABOUT GOING
INTO THE WOODS OF ENGLAND.
>> IT IS A WORLD, THAT AS AN
AMERICAN KID, I WOULD NEVER HAVE
KNOWN.
>> THAT IS IT.
AND VERY QUINTESSENTIALLY
BRITISH, WITH
CAPTIONED BY THE
S AND CUPS OF TEA.
AND THERE IS MORE A BIT OF ME IN
THEM.
>> IT IS A VERY SPECIAL BOOK.
YOU KEEP SUCH A BUSY SCHEDULE AT
IN POINT.
DO YOU STILL HAVE TIME FOR A
SOCIAL LIFE AT THIS POINT?
>> WHAT IS THAT?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW,
RELATIONSHIPS.
>> I WAS JUST JOKING.
>> LOVES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
>> AT THE MOMENT, IT IS
IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO HAVE A
GOOD RELATIONSHIP, YOU HAVE TO
SORT YOURSELF OUT FIRST.
YOU KNOW, MIND, BODY, SOUL.
GET YOURSELF WELL AND THAT HE
HEALTHY.
AND I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.
I'M DOING BETTER.
MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW.
AT THE MOMENT I'M NOT DATING
ANYONE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
REALLY WANT TO KNOW.
>> I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
KNOW.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
REALIZES, WITH THE WORLD'S PRESS
ATTENTION THAT I HAVE, IT IS
GOING TO BE A PRETTY TOUGH JOB.
AND I'M RED HEADED.
>> WELL.
>> FEISTY.
>> SO IS LITTLE RED.
>> AND A SURVIVOR.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE YOUR TWO DAUGHTERS,
PRINCESS BEATRICE, AND EUGENIA.
HOW THAT YOU HAVE TWO YOUNG
WOMEN, 16 AND 18 YEARS OLD.
WHAT KIND OF ADVICE ARE YOU
GIVING THEM?
ARE THEY GIVING YOU VISION AS
FAR AS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS?
>> I THINK, AL, THE MOST CRUCIAL
THING FOR A PARENT IS TO LISTEN.
AND I DON'T THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE
WLISEN TO EXACTLY THE VOICE OF
TEENAGERS.
BECAUSE WHEN THEY SLAM A DOOR OR
MAYBE THEY'RE SORT OF QUITE
IMPETUOUS OR MAY GET ANGRY, IT'S
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE, IT'S
BECAUSE THEY'RE FRIGHTENED, AND
MAYBE THEY CAN'T EXPRESS IT.
SO IF WE CAN SIT IN A ROOM, TURN
OFF THE TELEVISIONS, TURN OFF
THE MOBILE PHONES, AND SAY HOW
ARE YOU TODAY, AND REALLY MEAN
IT?
IN AMERICA, THE NEW TRANSLATION
FOR HELLO IN AMERICA IS HELLO,
HOW ARE YOU?
AND I SAY OH, I'M FINE, AND
THEY'VE MOVED ON.
THEY'VE WALKED DOWN THE STREET.
>> BUT CERTAINLY WITH MY GIRLS,
WHEN THEY SAY TO ME, MOM, YOU
CANNOT GO OUT LOOKING LIKE THAT,
I THINK THAT'S GOOD VISION.
ga
I THINK I SHOULD TAKE IT.
AND MUM, THAT GUY, NO, HUH-UH,
NO.
>> HAVE THEY HELPED YOU IN THAT
CATEGORY?
>> WELL, NO, BECAUSE THERE'S NOT
BEEN MANY GUYS AROUND,
APPROXIMATE SO THEY HAVEN'T GONE
THERE. BUT I THINK IT'S QUITE
GOOD.
LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY TO ME, YOU
KNOW, WITH YOUR GIRLS HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY DATE
THE RIGHT GUYS WELL, YOU CAN'T
DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T CHECK EVERYBODY, YOU
KNOW?
>> WELL, YOU CAN, BUT YOU'LL BE
VERY BUSY, AND THEY STILL WON'T
LISTEN TO YOU.
>> AND I DON'T THINK MOM WOULD
BE TOO POPULAR IN THE HOWTION.
>> BUT YOU ARE GOING TO BE
POPULAR BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS.
>> WELL, I HOPE EVERYONE COMES
ON A JOURNEY WITH ME.
AND IT'S A GREAT JOURNEY INTO
BUTTERCUP COTTAGE.
>> THE BOOK IS "LITTLE RED'S
SUMMER ADVENTURE."
SARAH FERGUSSON, THE DUCHESS OF

AND THEY HAVE LITTLE WEIGHT
THAT'S COME WITH THE SET.
AND THEY ALLOW YOU TO ADJUST THE
WEIGHT OF THE CLUB FOR THE SPEED
OF THE GREENS.
SO IF THE GREENS ARE SLOW, CAN
YOU ADD MORE WEIGHT, IF THEY'RE
SLOW, YOU TAKE OUT WEIGHT.
>> WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING FOR?
>> I'M GOING FOR THAT ONE IN THE
SCORNER POCKET HE SAID.
>> CORNER POCKET.
>> THEY TALK LIKE THAT IN GOLF.
OH, YOU DID IT RIGHT THERE.
GOOD JOB.
LET'S SEE IF I CAN DO THAT AND
GUERIN HAVE FIGURED OUT A LOT OF
PEOPLE LIKE TO ADJUST.
>> THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT.
THANKS CROWD FOR PLAYING ALONG.
>> THEY LIKE TO ADJUST IN THE
MIDDLE OF THEIR GAME, THAT IS A
GREAT WAY TO DO IT.
>> NOW TELL US WHAT WE HAVE
HERE.
>> THIS IS A G6.
IT HAS THREE AC SELLEROMETERS IN
IT.
THIS RECORDS THE SPEED AND
SPRELSIT OF INJURE CLUB HEAD,
AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER ASPECTS
OF YOUR CLUB SWING.

IF YOU EVER GET TO THE GREEN.
THIS IS A MARKER FOR YOUR BALL.
THAT IS INCLUDED.
IF YOU LEAVE A DIVOT, IT FIXES
YOUR DIVOT.
AND THERE ARE THINGS IN HERE TO
CLEAN OUT THE CLUB HEAD AS WELL.
>> ONLY $50, AND THERE IS OF
COURSE A BOTTLE OPENER.
>> THE 19th HOLE, CORRECT,
EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> WOMEN'S GOLF CLUBS, ARE THESE
AS GOOD AS MEN'S CLUBS BY ADAMS.
>> BY ADAMS GOLF.
THEY ARE ACTUALLY BETTER THAN
MEN'S CLUBS FOR WOMEN.
ONE OF THE THING WOMEN ARE AWARE
OF IS THEIR CLUB HEAD SPEED IS
AROUND 70 MILES AN HOUR, THE
DIFFERENCE IF YOU CAN'T GET
UNDER THE BALL, THE BALL WON'T
GO UP.

THAT I LIKE TO DO.
I LIKE TO MAKE MYSELF LITTLE
PACKETS.
I LIKES TO PUT EVERYTHING ALL
READY TO GO IN LITTLE ZIP LOCK
BAG, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL
IT OUT AND THROW IT IN YOUR POT

LISTEN TO THIS, 45% OF THOSE
INJURIES WERE IN CHILDREN.
>> FIREWORKS ARE DANGEROUS.
THEY CAUSE INJURIES EVERY YEAR.
WE HAD A PERSON AT THE CITY OF
SAN DIEGO, NEW YEAR'S EVE THAT
ACTUALLY LOST HIS HAND DUE TO A
FIRE WORKS INJURY.
WE RATHER GO SEE THE SHOWS, HAVE
A GOOD TIME ON THE 4th OF
JULY BUT DON'T DO THEIR OWN
SHOWS.
WE ALWAYS END UP WITH INJURIES
AND WITH THE HEAT THAT WE HAVE
HAD, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FIRES
AS WELL.
